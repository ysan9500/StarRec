Increasing adoption of holographic AR display technology in healthcare & precision surgery is anticipated to fuel the market expansion. For instance, holographic AR display technology can enable surgery with an ability to overlay 3D models generated via MRIs and CT scans. Similarly, in the travel sector, this technology can offer visual access to tourist sites, nearby restaurants, and real-scene navigation to enhance the traveller's experience.\nRequest PDF Sample Report: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/A31882\nThe holography AR display market is growing as a result of an increase in investments in 3D technology across a wide range of industries, including the entertainment industry for gaming and the advent of 3D channels. In addition, the rapid increase in the need for 3D display technologies in industries such as the military and medical is also anticipated to drive the market growth during the forecast period. Various market players are also making investments in product innovation to increase their functionalities. The holographic AR display can be used in the infrastructure sector. For instance, holographic AR-based smart glass can bring augmented reality experience to any building. Hence, this technology can be used across commercial & residential buildings. In the upcoming years, these factors are anticipated to boost the holographic AR display market growth.\nThe high manufacturing costs involved with holographic AR display devices are a significant cause of concern as they hamper the growth of the holographic display market. In addition, the growing adoption of holographic display systems has been significantly hampered by poor technicians and a lack of understanding among the population. The middle class and lower middle class have reduced purchasing power as a result of its high cost. All these are the major factors expected to hamper the holographic AR display market trends during the forecast period.\nPurchase Enquiry: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/purchase-enquiry/A31882\nThe key players profiled in the holographic AR display market report include WayRay AG., Continental AG, Visteon Corporation, Sygic, DigiLens Inc., Indiegogo, Inc., Futurus Group, and Avegant Corp.\nThe report offers a comprehensive analysis of the global holographic AR display market forecast by thoroughly studying different aspects of the market including major segments, market statistics, market dynamics, regional market outlook, holographic AR display market analysis based on investment opportunities, and top players working towards the growth of the market. The report also highlights the present scenario and upcoming trends & developments that are contributing toward the growth of the market. Moreover, restraints and challenges that hold power to obstruct the market growth are also profiled in the report along with Porter\u2019s five forces analysis of the market to elucidate factors such as competitive landscape, bargaining power of buyers and suppliers, threats of new players, and the emergence of substitutes in the market.\nTrending Reports:IoT in Smart Cities Market: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/A13168Print on Demand Market: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/A212927Cloud Artificial Intelligence Market: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/A09364Commerce Cloud Market: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/request-sample/A09920\nAbout Us:Allied Market Research (AMR) is a full-service market research and business-consulting wing of Allied Analytics LLP based in\u202fPortland,\u202fOregon.

However, Samsung's smartwatch sales volume and revenue grew by 2% and 7% year-on-year respectively. In addition, earphone products saw a nearly 30% year-on-year increase in sales revenue.Samsung believes that the high penetration rate of the wearable device market and the wide range of products from brand manufacturers make it relatively challenging to fully display these items in physical stores. This is why significant growth opportunities will be hard to come by in the future wearable device market.To boost sales, Samsung plans to introduce a more comprehensive product lineup to cater to different consumer groups. Additionally, the company will enhance efforts to bundle wearables with smartphone sales, using methods like add-on purchases to attract market attention. Moreover, Samsung will strengthen product experiences to boost consumers' purchase willingness.Samsung emphasized that consumer brand preference for Samsung grew by over 40% year-on-year in 2023. The proportion of new young users also increased from 13% to 43%. To align with trends, besides continuing to optimize products, marketing, and sales channels, Samsung will also seek cross-industry collaboration opportunities with sectors like music and gaming to boost its brand power.Furthermore, Samsung highlighted that its Galaxy AI ecosystem is more complete than its competitors. By continuing to empower its products with AI, Samsung aims to create a greater differentiation in brand value and product strength over its peers.\n\n\n\nRelated storiesSamsung's new smartwatches, smart rings bolster its AI ecosystemNew Samsung smartphones showcase foldables, GenAIPC designs growing more revolutionarySamsung takes dual-track approach with smartwatches and smartphones to expand Galaxy AI ecosystemHuawei ramping up Kirin chip output for smart wearablesShow moreCategoriesAI IT + CE IT components, peripherals Tagsbrand demand Galaxy revenue sales Samsung smartphone smartwatch wearable \n\nShare this article\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther links\n\n\nPrint\n\n\n\n\nRelated topicGlobal supply chain: Emerging tech, businesses\n\n\n\nBIZ FOCUSJul 18, 10:42Generative AI ignites: Semiconductor industry shows new facetMonday 15 July 2024Crypto Quantique partners with silicon IP distributors across Asia to deliver quantum-driven chip securityMonday 15 July 2024How cryptocurrency technology can enhance financial servicesThursday 11 July 2024TechInsights: Americas' chip suppliers continue to dominate R&D spendingTOP STORIES7 DAYS NEWSChina's counter-intuitive semiconductor exports surge goes unnoticedTaiwan fab toolmakers grab major orders from TSMC and ChinaMediaTek to surpass Qualcomm Snapdragon in 5G smartphone marketAI server shipments to surge in 2H24 as GPU shortage easesSK Hynix on track to explore interposer-free HBM4 productionHuawei sues MediaTek in potential shift to IC design house patent licensingOpenAI reportedly talks with Broadcom for chip development amid growing GPU-ASIC competitionTSMC proposes Foundry 2.0 to alleviate antitrust concernsFanuc completes new US facility for automotive robotsRising chip competition worries mobile phone makersFull list\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoin our mailing list\n\n\n\n\n\nDIGITIMES\n\nAbout\nAdvertising\nMembership\nTerms & conditions\nPrivacy policy\nCopyright policy\nContact us\nNotes & corrections\nSite map\n\u4e2d\u6587\u7db2\u7e41\u9ad4\n\u4e2d\u6587\u7f51\u7b80\u4f53\n\n\n\nTOOLS & SERVICES\n\nTomorrow's Headlines\n7 days news\nWeb news elsewhere\nTopics\nRSS\n\n\n\n\n\u00a9\u00a02024 DIGITIMES Inc.
