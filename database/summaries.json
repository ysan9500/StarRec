In previous years various amounts up to \\u00a3100,000 were received as a grant. However this year, due to budgetary restrictions, the annual grant has been limited to \\u00a340,000 and sadly costs have not gone down and in fact have increased substantially,\\u201d Mr Higgins said.A Lancaster flying high at the Jersey International Air Display in 2023 Picture: DAVID FERGUSON. (38594549)A crowdfunding page has been launched and Mr Higgins said that if each person who watched the display were to donate \\u00a35, it would not only fund this year\\u2019s display but also put the event on a more sustainable footing for the future.\\u201cThe Jersey International Air Display is part of the DNA of our Island community. Not only is it a significant event in the Island\\u2019s calendar for locals and visitors alike but, with its origins in the previous Battle of Britain Air Display, it also remains a poignant reminder of the reasons behind our Liberation, and our liberty. It also remains a significant day for relevant charities to raise funds to care for our military veterans,\\u201d Mr Higgins said.Watched in person and online by more than 50,000 people \\u2013 the organisers say \\u2013 the display is funded from a combination of private and government sources. Mr Higgins explained that, having had to reduce its scale as a result of restrictions following the Covid pandemic, they now aspired to return the event to its previous stature with enhanced static displays and educational areas.Jersey International Air Display organiser Mike Higgins at the 2023 display Picture: James Jeune (38598762)Aircraft booked for the 2024 display include the \\u00c9quipe de Voltige de l\\u2019Arm\\u00e9e de l\\u2019Air (French Air Force Extra 330), the RAF Falcons parachute display team, the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Lancaster, the French North American OV-10 Bronco, French Conair Turbo Firecat (ex-S\\u00e9curit\\u00e9 Civile fire fighting aircraft), Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat and the Dutch Fokker D.XXI WW II fighter.Mr Higgins said that, in the event that the 2024 display did not take place, all funds raised would be put towards next year\\u2019s event, or split between Jersey\\u2019s Helping Wings charity and British Military Service charities if the decision were taken not to proceed permanently.Those wishing to support the event can do so using the link: sportsgiving.co.uk/sponsor/activity/appeal-for-12-september-2024/jersey-international-air-display.

The sentencing took place on July 18 with Judge Ha Sang-je of the Suwon District Court's 12th Criminal Division presiding over the case.Mr. A, an expert in the OLED display field, worked at Samsung Display for over a decade before resigning to establish and operate his own display company in Korea. From 2018 to May 2020, Mr. A illegally acquired and used Samsung's trade secrets, including the \\\"OLED Display ELA (Excimer Laser Annealing) Equipment Inversion Optical System\\\" and \\\"OCR Inkjet Equipment\\\" technology, to sell and provide to Chinese companies.The ELA equipment inversion optical system is crucial for maintaining the intensity and stability of lasers used on OLED electronic circuits, while the OCR inkjet equipment is used to bond the OLED panel and the outermost cover glass of the screen. These technologies are valued at more than 340 billion won (around $251 million) and are integral to Samsung's competitive edge in the OLED market.Mr. A's scheme involved his juniors, subordinates, and friends from his time at Samsung, who helped siphon off trade secrets to his domestic company and replicate Samsung Display's technology. In August 2020, five accomplices were indicted. Among them, three former Samsung Display researchers were sentenced to one to two years in prison, while two friends received suspended sentences.In October 2020, Mr. A was indicted and detained on charges of violating the Unfair Competition Prevention Act (leaking trade secrets abroad). His detention period was set to expire in March of this year, and he was released on bail to be tried without detention. However, following the sentencing on July 18, Mr. A was immediately taken into custody.Samsung is a global leader in OLED technology, which is known for its superior image quality, including better contrast, faster response times, and more vibrant colors compared to traditional LCD displays. The company has invested heavily in research and development to maintain its competitive edge in the display market. The theft of such advanced technology can have significant repercussions, affecting the competitive landscape and leading to financial losses for Samsung.

Not only that, each of the 50 YouTubers received a retro gaming handheld to call their own.The discovery was made on r/SBCGaming, where a screenshot of LilyPichu\\u2019s vlog of her experience being in the MrBeast competition surfaced. Each participant was given a goody bag, which features custom AirPods, and something a little more unusual: An Anbernic RG353V handheld.Article continues after adArticle continues after adThe Anbernic RG353V isn\\u2019t one of the priciest retro handhelds out there. In fact, the device with its 3.4-inch IPS display, and up to 2GB LPDDDR4 of RAM (depending on the version) has an MRSP of $120.99. Even with all 50 YouTubers each receiving their own, that\\u2019s still just over $6000 USD of handhelds alone.While the Anbernic RG353V is not the most expensive, or even the most high-powered retro handheld out there, MrBeast\\u2019s choice to give it away makes sense. The YouTuber has cited his love of the Nintendo Game Boy repeatedly in the past, even going so far as to commission a custom Game Boy from The Retro Future years ago.Related:MrBeast reveals insane ad revenue earned from Twitter/X videoArticle continues after adAlthough the RG353V is not an official Nintendo handheld, it takes after the Game Boy in multiple ways. Its form factor is highly reminiscent of that of the DMG model Game Boy but with some added extras. Article continues after adInstead of just a D-pad and two-button layout, the RG353V features a left stick, a full ABXY button layout, and built-in WiFi. Depending on the version MrBeast gave away, the retro handheld also has a touch-screen to use alongside Android-based games, a microSD card slot, and a 3200mAH rechargeable battery.
