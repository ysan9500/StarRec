What began in 2007 with the charter to detect and track mortars, rockets and artillery, is now bringing the future of warfare to the present day. Here are 5 ways the Q-53 radar is staying relevant and critical in the future of warfighting:\\u00a0 1)\\u00a0Active production line = faster to the field = proven combat system & C2 integrationThe Q-53 is mission ready today. With nearly 200 fielded, and more on the way for the U.S. Army and other customers, Lockheed Martin has an active production line and demonstrates proven performance. It can also be integrated with many combat /command & control (C2) platforms.\\u00a0  2)\\u00a0Open Architecture to easily add missionsThe Q-53\\u2019s active electronically scanned array (AESA) provides the foundation for multi-mission capabilities and plays a key role in the expanded capabilities that are now critical to homeland defense in the US and abroad. The Q-53 has demonstrated the ability to\\u00a0identify and track unmanned aerial systems\\u00a0(UAS), showing the capacity to incorporate air surveillance simultaneously with counter target acquisition in a single sensor. The Q-53 integrated with the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system to serve as the primary fire control source for the Coyote Block 2 C-UAS defeat system.These enhancements enable increased radar performance in challenging operating environments. Upgrades include support for Long Range Precision Fires and Air and Missile Defense missions. The Q-53 capabilities are key enablers for these missions and represent continued dedication to the advancement of technology in this space.\\u00a0Photo by\\u00a01st Lt. Stephanie Snyder  3)\\u00a0S-band medium range air surveillance & gap filling capabilityRadars in the S-band or mid-band range, as the name implies, strike a balance between long-range and short-range capabilities. Mid-band radars are well suited for applications requiring moderate resolution and detection range, making them ideal for air & missile defense, weather monitoring, multi-function air defense and tracking.The Q-53 is a highly mobile S-band radar and can detect low-level flight surveillance in specific sectors, localizing fixed wing, rotary wing and UAS type threats, not to mention other gap filling needs like drug interdiction or detection of illegal aircraft. AKA, the Q-53 is survivable in the modern battlefield.\\u00a0\\u00a0  4)\\u00a0IFF Mode 5 - Discerning Friendly Fire vs. Enemy FireIdentification Friend for Foe (IFF) Mode 5 is an air surveillance mission and secondary survival capability that can detect friend or foe aircraft. According to the Department Operational Test & Evaluation, IFF systems are sensitive identification devices that emit signals used to identify whether a platform is friend or foe and thereby prevent fratricide. Unlike other legacy radars, the Q-53 can include IFF for Mode 5 for customers seeking that requirement on their air surveillance and detection assets.\\u00a0\\u00a0  5)\\u00a0In Good Company The Q-53 radar has a long history of exceeding U.S. Army, and other nations\\u2019, requirements and adapting to their evolving missions. The Q-53 is enhancing air surveillance capabilities and integrating with C2 systems and broader weapon systems, enabling soldiers to detect threats and make decisions faster. The Q-53 radar has high reliability and its performance has driven the Army\\u2019s desire to modernize the radar and continue to expand the system\\u2019s mission requirements, as evidenced by the U.S. Army\\u2019s follow-on contract in July 2021 to demonstrate the ability of the Q-53 radars to enhance future capability and maintain superior performance over peer and near-peer adversaries.  Ready for the Future, Today Staying\\u00a0Ahead of Ready\\u00a0is crucial as threats evolve at hypersonic speeds. The U.S. military and its allies need reliable, effective radar systems that can detect challenging targets and adapt to ever-changing landscapes.

A dual oscillator circuit and, surprisingly, an infrared motion sensor chip, 10maurycy10 finds.Gareth HalfacreeFollow18 days ago \\u2022 Sensors / HW101 Pseudonymous engineer \\\"10maurycy10\\\" has been digging deep into the inner workings of an RCWL-0516 microwave radar sensor, to find out how such a handy device can be sold for under a dollar \\u2014 and figured out how to turn it into an S-band transmitter instead.\\\"I recently got some cheap RCWL-0516 microwave motion sensors, mostly because I was wondering how China managed to make a radar for under a dollar,\\\" 10maurycy10 explains. \\\"Getting one working was quite easy, I just connected the VIN pin to five volts, GND to ground, and added a 1\\u00b5F decoupling capacitor on the 3V3 pin. When someone moves within ~5 meters [around 16 feet], the OUT pin goes up to 3 volts for 3 seconds. So it works, but how?\\\"Radar for under a dollar? 10maurycy10 finds out what makes the popular RCWL-0516 tick. (\\ud83d\\udcf7: 10maurycy10)The compact radar modules, popular for their low cost, are driven by a chip marked as a BISS0001 \\u2014 which is designed to detection motion using an infrared sensor. The RCWL-0516, though, uses microwave radar sensing \\u2014 which works, 10maurycy10 explains, because the resulting signals are roughly compatible. \\\"Because a motion sensor doesn\\u2019t care about the exact speed,\\\" the engineer writes, \\\"all the chip has to do is look for millivolt-level changes: all the hard work is already done.\\\"Analyzing the radio side of the board, 10maurycy10 found what appeared to be a single-transistor 3.18GHz oscillator \\u2014 but which, when connected to an oscilloscope, revealed itself to also offer a 20MHz pulse. \\\"What\\u2019s happening is that as the oscillator runs, it changes the 33pF capacitors, raising the emitter voltage until oscillator can\\u2019t run any more,\\\" 10maurycy10 concludes. \\\"At this point, the 220 Ohm resistor discharges the capacitor, restarting the oscillation in just a few nanoseconds.\\\"That turns the device into a super-regenerative receiver, with motion detected by the interference between echoes from static and moving objects and relies on signals arriving during the oscillation's start-up period. \\\"This sort of radar-by-wishful-thinking approach is probably why the sensor has very inconsistent performance,\\\" the engineer supposes. \\\"Indoors it works very nicely, with up to five meters of range, but outdoors with no convenient static returns it often doesn\\u2019t work at all.\\\"By turning one module into an S-band transmitter, a pair can act as a surprisingly functional speed sensor. (\\ud83d\\udcf7: 10maurycy10)Having figured out how the radar operates, 10maurycy10's last trick was to modify it \\u2014 disabling the 20MHz pulse to create an S-band microwave transmitter instead. The transmitter can be driven by on-off keying, the engineer explains, and can still operate as a radar \\u2014 though with dramatically reduced sensitivity. Combining it with an unmodified module improves things again, trading sensitivity for the ability to work as a speed sensor.The full analysis is written up on 10maurycy10's blog.radarsensormotion sensoroscilloscopeGareth HalfacreeFollowFreelance journalist, technical author, hacker, tinkerer, erstwhile sysadmin.

With its wide detection range, the OndoSense reach WA (Wide Angle) is particularly suited for detecting obstacles such as vehicles, people or objects as well as for positioning robots and machines. It detects static and moving objects even at close range from 0.1 meters and can be easily integrated even in confined spaces, thanks to its very small design. With up to 4 adjustable sensor zones, the OndoSense reach WA is ideal for flexible monitoring of security areas or collision avoidance of mobile robots or other vehicles. Thanks to innovative radar technology, the radar sensor always reliably detects objects of any nature, even outdoors or in difficult environments with dirt, smoke, steam, rain or poor lighting conditions. And as a result of its high measuring rate of 200 Hz, it always reliably detects obstacles even with fast movements. The OndoSense reach WA is suitable for collision avoidance, vehicle detection, object positioning and limit level control in transport & logistics, mining, shipping, mechanical and plant engineering, and agriculture.An OndoSense reach WA test package is currently available at an exclusive price of EUR 759 (limited offer): https://ondosense.com/en/os-reach-wa/Optimal object detection in close range from 0.1 metersThe OndoSense reach WA detects obstacles such as vehicles, people, walls and other static or moving objects from 0.1 meters to at least 25 meters. \\\"Our sensor offers the smallest blind zone on the market for anti-collision radars. This makes the OndoSense reach WA ideal for applications in which objects in close range must be reliably detected. This includes, for example, the detection or positioning of cars in the car wash, the prevention of collisions between aircraft and ground support equipment at the airport or the positioning of drilling machines or washing robots on walls or in tunnels. Our radar system thus enables safe operation without costly unplanned downtimes,\\\" explains Rainer Waltersbacher, Co-CEO of OndoSense.4 adjustable sensor zones - for flexible monitoring of safety areasIn addition, the OndoSense reach WA offers up to 4 sensor zones, which can be easily adjusted independently of one another via 3 switching points in the configuration software. The radar sensor thus offers flexible, reliable monitoring of the safety areas of machines and robots as well as safe collision avoidance of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in the ports or intralogistics. By connecting the sensor to the programmable logic controller (PLC), the speed of the AGV can, for example, be automatically adjusted in several stages up to the emergency stop to reliably avoid collision-related damage with expensive, lengthy repairs.Smallest anti-collision sensor on the radar marketWith its M30 design and a length of just 92 millimeters, the OndoSense reach WA is one of the smallest radar sensors for collision protection & object positioning. This means that the sensor can be easily integrated into vehicles, machines or robots even in small spaces. With a measuring rate of up to 200 Hz, the OndoSense reach WA is also suitable for applications in which detection speed plays an important role - e. g. when detecting moving obstacles or avoiding collisions between vehicles and mobile robots. And thanks to an opening angle of 15 degrees and a measuring precision of \\u00b11 mm, the OndoSense reach WA is suitable for precise positioning of machines or robot arms where the target object is tilted - i. e. not optimally aligned with the radar sensor.The radar sensor has an RS485 communication protocol, 3 digital switching outputs (PNP/NPN) and an analog current interface (4-20 mA). An IO-Link version will be available from 2025. The sensor can operate interfaces such as Profinet or CAN via a gateway.Reliable obstacle and object detection even in dirt, steam or rainThe OndoSense reach WA radar sensor for collision avoidance & object positioning detects static and moving objects even in dirt, smoke, steam, rain, snow, poor lighting conditions and light flashes. The radar also detects all materials, regardless of their properties.

July 8, 2024 at 10:30 amNew nEw NEWS From Adafruit Round-Up: April, May\\u2026SearchBLOGJuly 1, 2024 AT 1:57 pmInside (and hacking) a 1 dollar radar motion sensor 10maurycy10 recently bought some cheap RCWL-0516 microwave motion sensors, mostly wondering how China managed to make a radar for under a dollar.Getting one working was quite easy, I just connected the\\u00a0VIN\\u00a0pin to 5 volts,\\u00a0GND\\u00a0to ground, and added a 1 uF decoupling capacitor on the\\u00a03V3\\u00a0pin. When someone moves within ~5 meters, the\\u00a0OUT\\u00a0pin goes up to 3 volts for 3 seconds.So it works, but how?First, I found a datasheet for the the large SOIC-16 chip. It turns out the\\u00a0BISS0001\\u00a0is an\\u00a0infrared\\u00a0motion sensor chip? How does that work?Generally, motion and speed sensing (doppler) radars work by sending out a continuous carrier and mixing the received signal with the transmitted carrier to create a low frequency IF signal. If reflections are coming from a moving object, the received signal will slowly drift in and out of phase with the transmitted signal, creating a beat frequency at just a few hertz. Because a motion sensor doesn\\u2019t care about the exact speed, all the chip has to do is look for millivolt-level changes: all the hard work is already done.At first glance, the whole thing is just a single transistor oscillator working at a frequency of 3.18 GHz,ut it\\u2019s actually 2 oscillators in one, the microwave oscillation is pulsed at around 20 MHz.See how the module was hacked in the post here.
