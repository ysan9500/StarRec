What began in 2007 with the charter to detect and track mortars, rockets and artillery, is now bringing the future of warfare to the present day. Here are 5 ways the Q-53 radar is staying relevant and critical in the future of warfighting:\\u00a0 1)\\u00a0Active production line = faster to the field = proven combat system & C2 integrationThe Q-53 is mission ready today. With nearly 200 fielded, and more on the way for the U.S. Army and other customers, Lockheed Martin has an active production line and demonstrates proven performance. It can also be integrated with many combat /command & control (C2) platforms.\\u00a0  2)\\u00a0Open Architecture to easily add missionsThe Q-53\\u2019s active electronically scanned array (AESA) provides the foundation for multi-mission capabilities and plays a key role in the expanded capabilities that are now critical to homeland defense in the US and abroad. The Q-53 has demonstrated the ability to\\u00a0identify and track unmanned aerial systems\\u00a0(UAS), showing the capacity to incorporate air surveillance simultaneously with counter target acquisition in a single sensor. The Q-53 integrated with the Forward Area Air Defense Command and Control (FAAD C2) system to serve as the primary fire control source for the Coyote Block 2 C-UAS defeat system.These enhancements enable increased radar performance in challenging operating environments. Upgrades include support for Long Range Precision Fires and Air and Missile Defense missions. The Q-53 capabilities are key enablers for these missions and represent continued dedication to the advancement of technology in this space.\\u00a0Photo by\\u00a01st Lt. Stephanie Snyder  3)\\u00a0S-band medium range air surveillance & gap filling capabilityRadars in the S-band or mid-band range, as the name implies, strike a balance between long-range and short-range capabilities. Mid-band radars are well suited for applications requiring moderate resolution and detection range, making them ideal for air & missile defense, weather monitoring, multi-function air defense and tracking.The Q-53 is a highly mobile S-band radar and can detect low-level flight surveillance in specific sectors, localizing fixed wing, rotary wing and UAS type threats, not to mention other gap filling needs like drug interdiction or detection of illegal aircraft. AKA, the Q-53 is survivable in the modern battlefield.\\u00a0\\u00a0  4)\\u00a0IFF Mode 5 - Discerning Friendly Fire vs. Enemy FireIdentification Friend for Foe (IFF) Mode 5 is an air surveillance mission and secondary survival capability that can detect friend or foe aircraft. According to the Department Operational Test & Evaluation, IFF systems are sensitive identification devices that emit signals used to identify whether a platform is friend or foe and thereby prevent fratricide. Unlike other legacy radars, the Q-53 can include IFF for Mode 5 for customers seeking that requirement on their air surveillance and detection assets.\\u00a0\\u00a0  5)\\u00a0In Good Company The Q-53 radar has a long history of exceeding U.S. Army, and other nations\\u2019, requirements and adapting to their evolving missions. The Q-53 is enhancing air surveillance capabilities and integrating with C2 systems and broader weapon systems, enabling soldiers to detect threats and make decisions faster. The Q-53 radar has high reliability and its performance has driven the Army\\u2019s desire to modernize the radar and continue to expand the system\\u2019s mission requirements, as evidenced by the U.S. Army\\u2019s follow-on contract in July 2021 to demonstrate the ability of the Q-53 radars to enhance future capability and maintain superior performance over peer and near-peer adversaries.  Ready for the Future, Today Staying\\u00a0Ahead of Ready\\u00a0is crucial as threats evolve at hypersonic speeds. The U.S. military and its allies need reliable, effective radar systems that can detect challenging targets and adapt to ever-changing landscapes. Lockheed Martin\\u2019s Radar Center of Excellence makes our sensors the top choice for more than 45 nations on six continents and all branches of the US military.\\u00a0Learn More About Q-53 Helpful Links \\u00a0 ___What We DoOur CapabilitiesOur ProductsWho We AreCareersCommunityLeadershipNewsroomSustainabilityAbout UsInformationEmployeesInternationalInvestorsSuppliersConnectContact UsMedia RelationsMultimediaDisclosuresJoin the Vector Star newsletterGet articles on the innovative projects Lockheed Martin scientists and engineers are working on right now.Sign Up Now\\r                    \\u00a9 2024\\r                    \\r                    Lockheed Martin Corporation.\\r                    \\r                    All Rights Reserved.\\r                PrivacyTerms of UseEU and UK Data Protection Notice (EU-US DPF Privacy Notice)Cookies\\r                    Stock Price\\r                    \\r                    Social Media\\r                    \",\n      \"type\": \"Document\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"lc\": 1,\n    \"type\": \"constructor\",\n    \"id\": [\n      \"langchain\",\n      \"schema\",\n      \"document\",\n      \"Document\"\n    ],\n    \"kwargs\": {\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"source\": \"https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/news/5895881\",\n        \"title\": \"Radar Sensor Market Evolution Emerging Technologies and Trends for 2032 | Taiwan News | Jun. 26, 2024 10:05\",\n        \"language\": \"en\"\n      },\n      \"page_content\": \"Radar Sensor Market Evolution Emerging Technologies and Trends for 2032 | Taiwan News | Jun. 26, 2024 10:05\\u6f22EN\\u6f22ENPoliticsAllForeign AffairsCross-straitBusinessAllInvestingTechSocietyHealthCultureEnvironmentLifestyleAllTravelCuisineSportsEntertainmentVarietyAllFeature PhotoOpinionWorldSponsoredMOREPoliticsAllForeign AffairsCross-straitBusinessAllInvestingTechSocietyHealthCultureEnvironmentLifestyleAllTravelCuisineSportsEntertainmentVarietyAllFeature PhotoOpinionWorldSponsoredLoading...About UsContact UsDirectory of TaiwanAbout UsContact UsDirectory of TaiwanTaiwan News \\u00a9 2024 All Rights Reserved.Home/Report OceanRadar Sensor Market Evolution Emerging Technologies and Trends for 2032Report Ocean\\u2003Jun. 26, 2024 10:05283The global Radar Sensor Market is anticipated to reach USD 44.4 billion by 2026 according to a new research published by Report Ocean Market Research.

A dual oscillator circuit and, surprisingly, an infrared motion sensor chip, 10maurycy10 finds.Gareth HalfacreeFollow20 days ago \\u2022 Sensors / HW101 Pseudonymous engineer \\\"10maurycy10\\\" has been digging deep into the inner workings of an RCWL-0516 microwave radar sensor, to find out how such a handy device can be sold for under a dollar \\u2014 and figured out how to turn it into an S-band transmitter instead.\\\"I recently got some cheap RCWL-0516 microwave motion sensors, mostly because I was wondering how China managed to make a radar for under a dollar,\\\" 10maurycy10 explains. \\\"Getting one working was quite easy, I just connected the VIN pin to five volts, GND to ground, and added a 1\\u00b5F decoupling capacitor on the 3V3 pin. When someone moves within ~5 meters [around 16 feet], the OUT pin goes up to 3 volts for 3 seconds. So it works, but how?\\\"Radar for under a dollar? 10maurycy10 finds out what makes the popular RCWL-0516 tick. (\\ud83d\\udcf7: 10maurycy10)The compact radar modules, popular for their low cost, are driven by a chip marked as a BISS0001 \\u2014 which is designed to detection motion using an infrared sensor. The RCWL-0516, though, uses microwave radar sensing \\u2014 which works, 10maurycy10 explains, because the resulting signals are roughly compatible. \\\"Because a motion sensor doesn\\u2019t care about the exact speed,\\\" the engineer writes, \\\"all the chip has to do is look for millivolt-level changes: all the hard work is already done.\\\"Analyzing the radio side of the board, 10maurycy10 found what appeared to be a single-transistor 3.18GHz oscillator \\u2014 but which, when connected to an oscilloscope, revealed itself to also offer a 20MHz pulse. \\\"What\\u2019s happening is that as the oscillator runs, it changes the 33pF capacitors, raising the emitter voltage until oscillator can\\u2019t run any more,\\\" 10maurycy10 concludes. \\\"At this point, the 220 Ohm resistor discharges the capacitor, restarting the oscillation in just a few nanoseconds.\\\"That turns the device into a super-regenerative receiver, with motion detected by the interference between echoes from static and moving objects and relies on signals arriving during the oscillation's start-up period. \\\"This sort of radar-by-wishful-thinking approach is probably why the sensor has very inconsistent performance,\\\" the engineer supposes. \\\"Indoors it works very nicely, with up to five meters of range, but outdoors with no convenient static returns it often doesn\\u2019t work at all.\\\"By turning one module into an S-band transmitter, a pair can act as a surprisingly functional speed sensor. (\\ud83d\\udcf7: 10maurycy10)Having figured out how the radar operates, 10maurycy10's last trick was to modify it \\u2014 disabling the 20MHz pulse to create an S-band microwave transmitter instead. The transmitter can be driven by on-off keying, the engineer explains, and can still operate as a radar \\u2014 though with dramatically reduced sensitivity. Combining it with an unmodified module improves things again, trading sensitivity for the ability to work as a speed sensor.The full analysis is written up on 10maurycy10's blog.radarsensormotion sensoroscilloscopeGareth HalfacreeFollowFreelance journalist, technical author, hacker, tinkerer, erstwhile sysadmin.

With its wide detection range, the OndoSense reach WA (Wide Angle) is particularly suited for detecting obstacles such as vehicles, people or objects as well as for positioning robots and machines. It detects static and moving objects even at close range from 0.1 meters and can be easily integrated even in confined spaces, thanks to its very small design. With up to 4 adjustable sensor zones, the OndoSense reach WA is ideal for flexible monitoring of security areas or collision avoidance of mobile robots or other vehicles. Thanks to innovative radar technology, the radar sensor always reliably detects objects of any nature, even outdoors or in difficult environments with dirt, smoke, steam, rain or poor lighting conditions. And as a result of its high measuring rate of 200 Hz, it always reliably detects obstacles even with fast movements. The OndoSense reach WA is suitable for collision avoidance, vehicle detection, object positioning and limit level control in transport & logistics, mining, shipping, mechanical and plant engineering, and agriculture.An OndoSense reach WA test package is currently available at an exclusive price of EUR 759 (limited offer): https://ondosense.com/en/os-reach-wa/Optimal object detection in close range from 0.1 metersThe OndoSense reach WA detects obstacles such as vehicles, people, walls and other static or moving objects from 0.1 meters to at least 25 meters. \\\"Our sensor offers the smallest blind zone on the market for anti-collision radars. This makes the OndoSense reach WA ideal for applications in which objects in close range must be reliably detected. This includes, for example, the detection or positioning of cars in the car wash, the prevention of collisions between aircraft and ground support equipment at the airport or the positioning of drilling machines or washing robots on walls or in tunnels. Our radar system thus enables safe operation without costly unplanned downtimes,\\\" explains Rainer Waltersbacher, Co-CEO of OndoSense.4 adjustable sensor zones - for flexible monitoring of safety areasIn addition, the OndoSense reach WA offers up to 4 sensor zones, which can be easily adjusted independently of one another via 3 switching points in the configuration software. The radar sensor thus offers flexible, reliable monitoring of the safety areas of machines and robots as well as safe collision avoidance of automated guided vehicles (AGVs) in the ports or intralogistics. By connecting the sensor to the programmable logic controller (PLC), the speed of the AGV can, for example, be automatically adjusted in several stages up to the emergency stop to reliably avoid collision-related damage with expensive, lengthy repairs.Smallest anti-collision sensor on the radar marketWith its M30 design and a length of just 92 millimeters, the OndoSense reach WA is one of the smallest radar sensors for collision protection & object positioning. This means that the sensor can be easily integrated into vehicles, machines or robots even in small spaces. With a measuring rate of up to 200 Hz, the OndoSense reach WA is also suitable for applications in which detection speed plays an important role - e. g. when detecting moving obstacles or avoiding collisions between vehicles and mobile robots. And thanks to an opening angle of 15 degrees and a measuring precision of \\u00b11 mm, the OndoSense reach WA is suitable for precise positioning of machines or robot arms where the target object is tilted - i. e. not optimally aligned with the radar sensor.The radar sensor has an RS485 communication protocol, 3 digital switching outputs (PNP/NPN) and an analog current interface (4-20 mA). An IO-Link version will be available from 2025. The sensor can operate interfaces such as Profinet or CAN via a gateway.Reliable obstacle and object detection even in dirt, steam or rainThe OndoSense reach WA radar sensor for collision avoidance & object positioning detects static and moving objects even in dirt, smoke, steam, rain, snow, poor lighting conditions and light flashes. The radar also detects all materials, regardless of their properties. Thanks to its dust-tight, jet-proof housing (IP 67) and its durable PTFE lens, the robust radar sensor is also suitable for demanding environments and outdoor applications.The powerful and robust OndoSense reach WA radar is ideal for collision avoidance, obstacle detection, vehicle and object detection and position control in transport & logistics, mining, shipping, mechanical and plant engineering or agriculture.More applications: https://ondosense.com/en/radar-sensors-industries-applications-solutions/collision-avoidance/OndoSense GmbH\\rB\\u00f6tzinger Str. 60\\r79111 Freiburg\\rGermanyAbout OndoSenseOndoSense realizes breakthrough radar sensor technology for a digitized industrial world.

When someone moves within ~5 meters, the\\u00a0OUT\\u00a0pin goes up to 3 volts for 3 seconds.So it works, but how?First, I found a datasheet for the the large SOIC-16 chip. It turns out the\\u00a0BISS0001\\u00a0is an\\u00a0infrared\\u00a0motion sensor chip? How does that work?Generally, motion and speed sensing (doppler) radars work by sending out a continuous carrier and mixing the received signal with the transmitted carrier to create a low frequency IF signal. If reflections are coming from a moving object, the received signal will slowly drift in and out of phase with the transmitted signal, creating a beat frequency at just a few hertz. Because a motion sensor doesn\\u2019t care about the exact speed, all the chip has to do is look for millivolt-level changes: all the hard work is already done.At first glance, the whole thing is just a single transistor oscillator working at a frequency of 3.18 GHz,ut it\\u2019s actually 2 oscillators in one, the microwave oscillation is pulsed at around 20 MHz.See how the module was hacked in the post here.

Here\\u2019s how it works.The rear cameras on the Galaxy S24 Ultra(Image credit: Future / Roland Moore-Colyer)We're unlikely to see the Samsung Galaxy S25 unveiled before January 2025, but in the meantime, Samsung has unveiled a trio of new mobile camera lenses \\u2013 one of which, a flagship 200MP camera, may well find its way into the Galaxy S25 series next year.Announced via a press release, the sensor series is led by the ISOCELL HP9. It has a 200MP resolution, 12% better light sensitivity, and a 10% improvement in autofocus contrast compared to its immediate predecessor in Samsung's line-up. This isn't actually a completely new camera though, as it's already shown up in the Vivo X100 Ultra.There's up to 4x optical zoom on the sensor itself, so it can reach up to a 12x zoom level when paired with another 3x telephoto module. As a reminder, the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24 Plus offer 3x optical zoom, while the Galaxy S24 Ultra boosts that to 5x.Considering the Galaxy S24 Ultra is already fitted with an older 200MP camera as part of its quad-lens setup, we suspect the ISOCELL HP9 is heading to the Galaxy S25 Ultra. That fits with previous rumors that the Galaxy S25 Ultra would get a new sensor that didn't increase the megapixel count but did improve light sensitivity.Minor upgrades on the wayThe new Samsung camera sensors (Image credit: Samsung)Also included in this new Samsung unveiling are the 50MP ISOCELL JN5 and the 50MP ISOCELL GNJ. The sensor size and megapixel count on that second camera closely matches what we saw in the Galaxy S24 and the Galaxy S24 Plus, so this may well be the primary camera for the newer models coming in 2025.Samsung is promising fewer artifacts in photos and videos from this improved camera sensor, more accurate color capture and better preservation of details. It's also less demanding than previous sensors regarding power draw, which will help with the battery life.All the signs are that the Galaxy 25 range is going to get relatively minor camera upgrades next year, but these new lenses \\u2013 if they are going to be used \\u2013 should help improve capture quality. Of course, the Galaxy S25 isn't mentioned in the press release at all.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.While we wait for 2025 to roll around, TechRadar will be covering Samsung's next Galaxy Unpacked from the ground on Wednesday, July 10.

The delivery includes an Operational Maintenance Trainer (OMT) manufactured in Germany by Hensoldt and operated in Australia by Hensoldt Australia.Featured CompaniesHENSOLDT                        8614 Westwood Center Dr Ste 550                        Vienna, VA 22182                    WebsiteCategoriesRadar/EW - SensorsRadar/EW - RF & MicrowaveUnmannedNewseVTOL company wins two UAS contracts for Australian defense forceJuly 15, 2024UnmannedNewsAutonomous project for USMC rotorcraft gets underwayJuly 12, 2024Radar/EWNewsNATO missile defense base in Poland now operationalJuly 11, 2024AvionicsNewsHardware encryption to be developed for Europe's Future Combat Air System by Indra, IDBOTICJuly 19, 2024UC-35D aircraft to be modernized for U.S. Marine Corps by AmentumJuly 18, 2024F-15EX Eagle II operational with Oregon Air National GuardJuly 16, 2024Senseeker Expands Low-Noise Neon\\u00ae Digital Readout IC Family for SWIR ApplicationsJuly 15, 2024AdaCore celebrates 30 years in businessJuly 15, 2024More AvionicsUnmannedNewseVTOL company wins two UAS contracts for Australian defense forceJuly 15, 2024Autonomous project for USMC rotorcraft gets underwayJuly 12, 2024Hybrid electric UAS built for DARPA by Northrop GrummanJuly 11, 2024D-Fend Solutions Upgrades EnforceAir2 C-UAS with User Interface Enhancements, AI-based Mitigation Engine, and New \\u201cDisrupted\\u201d Environments ModeJuly 11, 2024Supersonic strike missile to be developed for Norway by KongsbergJuly 09, 2024More UnmannedCyberNewsNew technologies, Industry 4.0 the focus of USAF contract with cybersecurity firm CorshaJuly 18, 2024wolfSSL earns first SP800-140Br1-compliant FIPS 140-3 Validation CertificateJuly 17, 2024Counter-IT contract for DoD won by KBR, worth as much as $52 millionJuly 15, 2024Cybersecurity tool for supply-chain software gets USAF small-business contractJuly 12, 2024DoD unveils IT integration, interoperability strategyJune 26, 2024More CyberCommsNewsLEO satellite market to grow by $7.13 billion: reportJuly 17, 2024Teledyne e2v releases upscreened Arm-based LX2160 processor for high-rel defense and aerospace applicationsJuly 16, 2024Teledyne e2v announces successful space qualification of 8 GB space DDR4 memoryJuly 16, 2024New rad-tolerant product family for space missionsJuly 15, 2024Software-defined radio from BAE Systems gets $111 million contract from ROKJuly 10, 2024More Comms Continue to site...CategoriesAvionicsUnmannedRadar/EWA.I.CyberCommsBlogsProductsWebcastsWhite PapersPress ReleasesPodcastsMagazinesLatest IssueArchiveSubscribeNewslettersThe McHale ReportAvionics DesignRadar & Electronic WarfareMilitary AISOSA UpdateUncrewed TechMonthly NewsletterSubscribeAdvertiseAUSA OpportunitiesAOC OpportunitiesSubmit ContentCompany DirectoryContactPrivacy Policy\\u00a92024 OpenSystems                                    Media\",\n      \"type\": \"Document\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"lc\": 1,\n    \"type\": \"constructor\",\n    \"id\": [\n      \"langchain\",\n      \"schema\",\n      \"document\",\n      \"Document\"\n    ],\n    \"kwargs\": {\n      \"metadata\": {\n        \"source\": \"https://hackaday.com/2024/07/01/so-much-going-on-in-so-few-components-dissecting-a-microwave-radar-module/\",\n        \"title\": \"So Much Going On In So Few Components: Dissecting A Microwave Radar  Module | Hackaday\",\n        \"language\": \"en-US\"\n      },\n      \"page_content\": \"So Much Going On In So Few Components: Dissecting A Microwave Radar  Module | HackadaySkip to contentHackadayPrimary MenuHomeBlogHackaday.ioTindieHackaday PrizeSubmitAboutSearch for: July 20, 2024 So Much Going On In So Few Components: Dissecting A Microwave Radar  Module                17 Comments            by:Jenny ListJuly 1, 2024Title:CopyShort Link:CopyIn the days before integrated circuits became ubiquitous, providing advanced functionality in a single package, designers became adept at extracting the maximum use from discrete components. They\\u2019d use clever circuits in which a transistor or other active part would fulfill multiple roles at once, and often such circuits would need more than a little know-how to get working. It\\u2019s not often in 2024 that we encounter this style of circuit, but here\\u2019s [Maurycy] with a cheap microwave radar module doing just that.On the board is an RF portion with a single transistor, some striplines, and an SOIC chip. Oddly this last part turns out to be an infra-red proximity sensor chip, so what\\u2019s going on? Careful analysis of the RF circuit reveals something clever. As expected, it\\u2019s a 3.18 GHz oscillator, but how is it functioning as both transmitter and receiver? The answer comes in the form of a resistor and capacitor in the emitter circuit, which causes the transistor to also oscillate at about 20 kHz. The result is that at different times in the 20 kHz period, the transistor is either off, fully oscillating at 3.18GHz and transmitting, or briefly in the not-quite-oscillating state between the two during which it functions as a super-regenerative receiver. This is enough for one device to effectively transmit and receive at the same time with the minimum of parts, there\\u2019s no need for a mixer diode as you might expect if it were it a direct conversion receiver. Perhaps in RF terms, it\\u2019s not particularly pretty, but we have to admit to being impressed by its simplicity. He goes on to perform a few experiments with the board as a transmitter or as a more conventional radar.This isn\\u2019t the first such radar module we\\u2019ve looked at, here\\u2019s one designed from scratch. And we love regens, since they are so simple to build.

But, a little worrying such a cheap transmitter can be had that doesn\\u2019t have FCC certification. 3.18ghz is a part 90 band, and since the carrier is getting modulated it\\u2019s going to splay all over. Just laziness on the oems part, since there are available bands for this kind of stuff.Probably this will fly under the radar, hah, but wonder when some alibaba express device will get semi popular and catch the attention of the FCCReport comment Reply Maurycy says: \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJuly 2, 2024 at 11:45 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe 3.18 GHz frequency seems a bit weird, there are similar devices using 5.8 GHz, which is a nice and wide ISM band in most places, but I don\\u2019t think any are commonly sold as modules from the usual sources (Amazon, Alibaba, etc). Perhaps 3.18 GHz is set aside for these things in China and they didn\\u2019t bother to redo it when selling overseas?Report comment Reply ftg says: \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJuly 3, 2024 at 1:50 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI have bought some \\u201c5.8GHz\\u201d doppler modules from aliexpress and they were on that band, but just barely and one of them was on weather radar band (5.4GHz).As for 3.18GHz, I guess they had to get away from other 2.4GHz users to avoid interference to and from them.And when you have a radar on S-band, the S-band radar band starts looking like the right place for it.Report comment Reply Peter says: \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJuly 2, 2024 at 10:46 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThese work fine with Arduinos, but as soon as I try to use them with an ESP the noise generated by the WiFi radio causes all sorts of false positives.

ESP gets a presence signal from sensor, cuts power to the sensor until it can handshake the message across WiFI, then resumes monitoring.Report comment Reply Kan says: \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJuly 2, 2024 at 10:56 am\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIt is a creative application.

Sign-in with:2 HomeNewsMy Favorites From Sensors Converge 2024NewsMy Favorites From Sensors Converge 2024June 28, 2024 by Dale WilsonA short recap of some of the most interesting technologies I was able to see while walking the show floor this year.Despite visiting over 30 booths in less than two days, I only scratched the surface of the technology that was on display at the Sensors Converge conference this past week. I am certain that I missed a lot of very fascinating technology, but I want to highlight here a few of the most interesting things I saw at the show that we haven\\u2019t already covered here on All About Circuits.\\u00a0TDK Delivers Wireless Power and Data Through Solid MetalAs Arthur C. Clarke famously wrote, \\u201cAny sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.\\u201d Well, this demo really looked like a magic trick. The sensor system was inside a tube without any physical connections to the outside world. But, it was powered up, collecting data, and transmitting the information to an external display.\\u00a0TDK demonstrates using acoustic waves to transfer power and data through solid metals.\\u00a0TDK used an acoustic data link (ADL) operating at 10-12 MHz to provide power and bi-directional communication through a metal plate at one end of the pipe. While this demo had a plexiglass section in the front to provide visibility, the entire system could have been encased in a metal Faraday cage.The demonstrator reported the live voltage and current consumption inside the pipe. The acoustic system provided up to 300 mW (10 mA at 3.0 V) and data at 10 kb/s. While there were quite a few other impressive wireless power transfer demos at the event, I certainly didn\\u2019t see any others that were transmitting power through metal.\\u00a0Murata Points the Way to True NorthI only had time to sit down to listen to one technology discussion, but I was lucky enough to land on an interesting one. Suvi Rauhamaa, Business Development Manager for Murata Electronics North America, introduced their new MEMS demonstrator that detects true north in less than one minute by measuring the rotation of the earth.\\u00a0Murata\\u2019s Suvi Rauhamaa introduces their MEMS gyroscope demonstrator that finds true north in less than one minute.\\u00a0It is amazing to me that the latest MEMs gyroscopes have the sensitivity and stability to measure the earth\\u2019s rotation with enough accuracy to determine latitude and longitude. It uses four Murata SCH16T-K01 IMUs, with each including a 6 degrees-of-freedom (DoF) XYZ-axis gyroscope and XYZ-axis accelerometer.According to Rauhamaa, a typical MEMs solution requires 30 minutes to determine an accurate heading, but the Murata design has reduced this to less than a minute. Their suggested applications included mining, tunneling, and construction.\\u00a0Improving Capacitive Touch InteractionThis wasn\\u2019t a new product release, but it was new to me. In the Microchip booth (that was cleverly designed to look like a small house), they were demonstrating a new add-on for capacitive touch screens.Anyone who has used a capacitive touch screen has experienced the frustration of it failing to register your finger or not responding properly as you try to move a virtual slider. These challenges recently led some auto manufacturers to move away from touchscreens.\\u00a0Michael Gong of Microchip explains the interaction of the Panasonic Magic Knob with the touchscreen enabled by Microchip\\u2019s controller.\\u00a0The Panasonic Magic Knob provided simple rotary operation and a tactile push-button response that was intuitive and easy to use. The Microchip controller provided clear feedback and multi-function input capabilities. This allowed the best of both worlds\\u2014a bright, dynamic display with a robust human-machine interface.Oh, and did I mention that the Magic Knob was simply glued to the display? No wires to connect or custom display requirements. A truly elegant solution.\\u00a0Generative AI is Not Just for Large Language ModelsOne of our most fun conversations was with Christopher Savoie, CEO of Zapata AI. He described how they are applying generative AI and machine learning to time-series data. Combining this with their unique quantum-based algorithms allows them to use significantly fewer computation resources to gain insights in industries that include manufacturing, transportation, logistics, and\\u2026automotive racing.\\u00a0Zapati AI is applying generative AI to the racing industry in partnership with Andretti Racing. Image used courtesy of Zapata AI\\u00a0Savoie described how their modeling system evaluates real-time race data from every car and driver on the track. He proudly highlighted how the system accurately predicted four yellow flag events one lap before an incident occurred on the track. More magic!\\u00a0Blue River Continues to Revolutionize AgricultureWe love what Blue River Technology, a John Deere company, is doing with imaging, AI, and advanced control systems to revolutionize agriculture. CEO Willy Pell explained how deep learning, better cameras, and advances in GPUs allow their new autonomous tractor technology to take over tilling operations and free farmers to focus on high-value activities. They are working to expand this capability to also support planting and grain carts.Pell also highlighted that during the latest growing season, their See & Spray system for intelligent herbicide application has been used on roughly 1 million acres of farmland. If you want to hear more about this technology, check out our Moore\\u2019s Lobby podcast interview with Chris Padwick, Director of Computer Vision and Machine Learning.\\u00a0Rhymes with Beacon, but It's Not a BeaconBlecon was an interesting newcomer at the show where they won the Best of Sensors Award 2024 for Connectivity. After 17 years working at Arm, Simon Ford decided to go his own way and founded Blecon in 2021.Ford explained how their technology is designed to leverage all of the benefits of Bluetooth (ultra-low-power and low-cost ICs) with the cloud connectivity of Wi-Fi or cellular networks. Blecon provides a network service that allows products to connect to the cloud through their custom hotspots using standard Bluetooth Low Energy chips. It is not either BLE beacon or mesh technology.\\u00a0Blecon founder Simon Ford explains how their technology supports Bluetooth connection to the cloud without pairing.\\u00a0The Blecon solution sets up a connection to transmit and receive data through the hotspot while providing security at the cloud and device levels. Ford described this as using Bluetooth Low Energy to provide back-haul connectivity. When I told Ford that I didn\\u2019t realize this type of connectivity was possible using Bluetooth, he acknowledged that this was a common response.\\u00a0What Did I Miss?If you saw anything else really interesting at the conference, please drop me a note in the comments! We might reach out to those companies to learn more about what we missed and cover it in a future article.\\u00a0Unless otherwise noted, all images used courtesy of the author.Related ContentCatch Up on Tiny Sensors: Bitty Accelerometer, Gas Sensor, and Biometric SensorAn Introduction to Motion Sensors: PIR, Tilt, Force, and MoreHardware Assessment: OPB9000 Reflective Light Sensor from TTElectronicsInfineon\\u2019s First Completely Autonomous Radar SensorCompact and Efficient Automotive Radar Sensor TestingW\\u00fcrth Elektronik at the Embedded World 2024Learn More About:Sensorscapacitive touchmicrochip technologymems inertial sensormurataconferenceagricultural technologyTDK InvenSenseGenerative AISensors Converge 2024Comments 2 CommentsLog in to commentRresampJune 29, 2024Excellent article!\\u00a0 Thanks for writing it.

It require ModusToolbox. I cant find the source for ModusToolbox.Did is miss something?Reply    misaz    13 days ago    \\u00a0            Foss    It is Makefile project based with open source SDK. (github Infineon/mtb-pdl-cat1 and Infineon/psoc6hal).ModusToolbox is recommended but not mandatory. Consist of Eclipse IDE and standalone tools for generating codes, both are closed source, but none of these is mandatory. They even spend effort migrating from Eclipse to VS Code which is now valid setup.Reply Post navigationPrevious PostPrevious   Elecrow LR1262 development board combines Raspberry Pi RP2040, SX1262 LoRaWAN module, and 1.8-inch LCDNext PostNext Sipeed Tang Mega 138K Dock is a lower-cost GOWIN GW5AST FPGA + RISC-V development board  \\t\\t\\tSearch for:\\t\\t  \\t\\tSearch\\t Facebook\\u00a0\\u00a0Twitter \\u00a0\\u00a0LinkedIn\\u00a0\\u00a0Telegram\\u00a0\\u00a0YouTube\\u00a0\\u00a0RSS Trending Posts - Last 7 Days  Radxa X4 low-cost, credit card-sized Intel N100 SBC goes for $60 and up 20.5k views | 23 comments SONOFF SWV Review \\u2013 A Zigbee Smart Water Valve tested with eWelink and Home Assistant 5.7k views | 4 comments ASRock IMB-A8000 industrial Ryzen Embedded 8000 mini-ITX motherboard takes up to 96GB DDR5 RAM 3.6k views | 4 comments Minino ESP32-C6 board is designed for IoT security and penetration testing 2.7k views | 1 comment Linux 6.10 Release \\u2013 Notable changes, Arm, RISC-V, and MIPS architectures 2.7k views | 1 comment Subscribe to Comments RSS FeedSPONSORS        Recent CommentsGussfaya on Radxa X4 low-cost, credit card-sized Intel N100 SBC goes for $60 and upRK on Radxa X4 low-cost, credit card-sized Intel N100 SBC goes for $60 and upJacques on The Blette Stick relies on Bluetooth 5.0 LE for off-grid messaging with up to 1.1km rangewillmore on Radxa X4 low-cost, credit card-sized Intel N100 SBC goes for $60 and upUpgrade pi-top [3] on The Blette Stick relies on Bluetooth 5.0 LE for off-grid messaging with up to 1.1km range Latest ReviewsSONOFF SWV Review \\u2013 A Zigbee Smart Water Valve tested with eWelink and Home AssistantToday, we are going to test and review another new Zigbee product from SONOFF, the SONOFF Zigbee Smart Water  [\\u2026]GEEKOM AE7 Review \\u2013 An AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS mini PC tested with Windows 11 and Ubuntu 24.04Today we\\u2019ll review the GEEKOM AE7 mini PC powered by an AMD Ryzen 9 7940HS octa-core processor with up  [\\u2026]Cincoze DS-1402 review: Part 3: Ubuntu 24.04 tested on an Intel Core i9-12900E embedded systemIn part one of the Cincoze DS-1402 review, I checked out the hardware of the modular rugged computer before  [\\u2026]  Change Ad ConsentDo not sell my dataCopyright 2010-2024 - CNX Software Limited Privacy PolicyThis website uses cookies to improve your experience.

Inside a 1 dollar radar motion sensor | Maurycy&#39;s blog https://10maurycy10.github.io/projects/motion_sensor_hacking/ The RCWL-0516 board looks like this. The top half is the front side and the bottom half is the back side. To operate this sensor, simply connect the 'VIN' on the right end to a 5V power supply and the 'GND' to a 0V GND.  First, 10maurycy10 analyzed the large chip 'BIS0001' installed on the board. Radars that detect motion and speed generally transmit continuous waves, which are electromagnetic waves with constant amplitude and frequency, and mix them with the received signal to generate an intermediate frequency signal. When an electromagnetic wave bounces off a moving object, the phase of the transmitted signal and the received signal shift, which allows the motion and speed to be detected. When checking the intermediate frequency signal input to BIS0001 with an oscilloscope, it looks like this. To check the performance of the sensor, 10maurycy10 moved his laptop towards the sensor, but the sensor detected not only the movement of the PC but also the movement of the hand before and after it.  Since the RCWL-0516 is a sensor that detects 'motion' regardless of speed, the BIS0001 only needs to detect slight changes in the input signal. And the signal is generated on the left half of the board.  The circuit on the left looks like this: At first glance it appears to be a single transistor oscillator operating at 3.18GHz, but it is actually two oscillators combined into one, with microwave oscillation pulsed at about 20MHz.  If you look at the emitter waveform, you can clearly see that it is pulsed. This pulse allows the oscillator to function as a super-regenerative receiver, which means that even if a small signal is received, it amplifies it again and again until it reaches the required signal size.  In the RCWL-0516, reflections from stationary objects more than 2.5 meters away are used as a radar local oscillator, and the super-regenerative receiver detects the amplitude-modulated signal from the interference of signals reflected from stationary and moving objects. Therefore, while the sensor works well indoors where there are many reflections from stationary objects, the sensor may not work at all outdoors even at the appropriate distance where there are no suitable stationary objects. 10maurycy10 says that he removed the capacitor for pulse generation in order to use the RCWL-0516 outdoors.  Since the RCWL-0516 was no longer emitting pulses and was no longer able to receive signals, 10maurycy10 set up another RCWL-0516 and checked the received signal, which was much more consistent, as shown below.  Although its sensitivity as a motion sensor has decreased, the sensor now functions reasonably well outdoors, and the improved signal consistency means it can now be used as a speed sensor.\",\n        \"language\": \"en\"\n      },\n      \"page_content\": \"What's inside a cheap motion sensor that costs around 160 yen? - GIGAZINEGIGAZINETwitterFacebookYouTube Jul 01, 2024 12:40:00What's inside a cheap motion sensor that costs around 160 yen? 10maurycy10, an engineer who reverse engineers various devices, published the results of his analysis of the microwave radar sensor 'RCWL-0516' that sells for $1 (about 161 yen) on his blog.

Sign upAs Tesla\\u2019s most advanced driver assistance software (ADAS) is becoming an immediate threat due to its impending arrival in China, major Chinese electric vehicle makers and auto tech companies are hurrying to pivot their strategies towards a more pragmatic yet challenging approach to developing similar offerings. Although Tesla\\u2019s rivals have for years been looking to cut out expensive components and master the newest artificial intelligence models, the game seems to be different this time.Both NIO and Xpeng Motors are now embracing the so-called computer vision approach, championed by Tesla, hoping their upcoming models will achieve human-like downtown driving in cities via the use of fitted cameras and radar, rather than more expensive laser sensor units. Sinpro.ai, a supplier to NIO of ultra-high-resolution four-dimensional (4D) imaging radar, said it is prepared for delivery later this year with an annual capacity of 800,000 units. Tesla has reportedly replaced radar sensors on some models after years of attempting to remove them.\\u201cIt will be a difficult task for Tesla\\u2019s Full Self-Driving (FSD) software to deal with scenarios in China where it is common that a large number of electric scooters are usually ahead in the same lane with motor vehicles,\\u201d Li Liyun, vice president of autonomous driving at Xpeng, wrote on June 27 on Chinese Twitter-like microblogging platform Weibo. Xpeng is planning to remove lidar from its upcoming sedan, scheduled for launch later this year, local media has reported.Xpeng and NIO are also following Tesla\\u2019s suit by transitioning to an \\u201cend-to-end\\u201d autonomous driving method after using modular-based neural networks that are heavily reliant on explicit coding. Meanwhile, more traditional automakers are turning to domestic tech companies for help, such as Huawei and DJI, to catch up with the latest AI trend. Despite big challenges pressuring the industry, some early movers have the potential to compete with the US pioneer, Liu Guanghao, partner at Shanghai-based venture capital firm Befor Capital, told TechNode.READ MORE: China opens door wider to Tesla as local giants disrupt the EV sector with AI-defined vehiclesVision-based approachA break from previous strategies of using expensive chips and sensors to enable ADAS capabilities, the latest approach centers on reducing the cost of components in hopes of making more room for further price cuts. Many now have their eyes on the use of radar, ditched by Tesla in 2021 due to limitations in identifying stationary objects with low image resolution, as some parts makers now said it is coming close to lidar in terms of performance \\u2013 but at a lower price tag.\\u201cThere is more overlap between lidar and our sixth-generation radar systems as we significantly improve the resolution,\\u201d Juergen Brandl, Head of Market China, Business Area Autonomous Mobility at Continental Group, told TechNode. \\u201cRadar could soon see through [objects] but lidar has some problems with the distance especially in difficult situations like fog and rain.\\u201d The German firm\\u2019s newest front-facing radar boasts a detection distance of 280 and 140 meters (174 and 87 miles) for vehicles and slow-walking pedestrians, respectively.Advanced radar solutions like this also create three-dimensional point cloud datasets like lidars, helping automakers and developers move towards fully end-to-end models with raw data collection from multiple sensors to train their self-driving systems. \\u201cWe can play a big role in the development of Level 2 plus ADAS systems in China,\\u201d Brandl said, adding that the company\\u2019s product is below the price of a lidar unit with \\u201cvery good\\u201c output in terms of point cloud data.Some disagree however, saying the technology is still at an early stage. Production of Continental\\u2019s latest-gen radar started early this year and the company began delivering the world\\u2019s first 4D radar in 2021, which detects an object\\u2019s vertical information in addition to distance, direction, and relative velocity, generating more dense point clouds than a contentional radar. Meanwhile, major Chinese lidar makers have consistently enhanced the performance of their products and lowered the prices to just over RMB 1,000 ($137.6) per unit in recent years.The key is whether 3D/4D radar could prove to be a more \\u201ccost competitive\\u201d option compared with lidar, said Liu. \\u201cI believe both [radar and lidar] have their special advantages and disadvantages,\\u201d Brandl said. \\u201dI think time or the market will tell whether we need both of them or one solution only.\\u201dEither way, prospects for early players are bright. Momenta, a self-driving car company backed by General Motors and Toyota, expects the bill of materials, or total cost of components, for the City NOA (Navigation on ADAS) function to be slashed to RMB 4,000-5,000 from the current RMB 7,000-10,000 in the next two years. The intent is to survive an unprecedented price war in China that has been ongoing for more than a year.End-to-end AIChinese carmakers used to brag about their coverage of cities where their assisted driving software is said to enable cars to handle on-ramp to off-ramp driving, automatic highway lane changing, and congested streets. However, many are now pivoting their focus to provide a more human-like driving experience and a full end-to-end AI model is now seen as key to winning the battle.Described by Tesla chief executive Elon Musk as \\u201cbasically photons in and controls out,\\u201d such end-to-end neural networks play an integral role in a vehicle\\u2019s decision-making process, taking raw sensor data as input and producing control actions as output. This contrasts with the conventional approaches that see each functionality, from perception to planning and action, developed individually using rule-based designs, which are often inadequate\\u00a0 in addressing the vast number of scenarios that occur on the road, a team of researchers said in a recent report.The result is that people still feel their cars pilot themselves inhumanly even when kitted out with some of the most cutting-edge ADAS on the market, partly because human driving behavior tends to be consistent rather than discrete. It is very difficult for the current AV (autonomous vehicle) stack to make coherent, long-term decisions, said Wu Xinzhou, Nvidia\\u2019s vice president of automotive at its annual developer conference GTC in March.Recent surveys have shown automakers that customers are generally dissatisfied with existing ADAS functions. Nearly half of respondents take the controls 1-2 times per 100 kilometers (62 miles) as the city NOA functions do not react appropriately, while others make more frequent interventions, according to a recent survey compiled by China\\u2019s Gaogong Industry Institute. \\u201cWhen the driver has to interfere pretty often, then you cannot say this is autonomous driving,\\u201d said Brandl.Xpeng is aiming for less than one intervention per 1,000 kilometers in major traffic areas in China, CEO He Xiaopeng announced early this year, without giving a timeframe. This was followed by a new software update for its XNGP ADAS in May enhanced by the first end-to-end AI model for production vehicles in China, according to the EV maker. NIO reshuffled its autonomous driving department recently, rolling up its perception as well as planning and control teams into a single group with a focus on new AI models, Chinese media outlet LatePost reported on June 19.It requires huge amounts of data, for example, millions of video clips, to train AI systems, as well as deep pockets and access to AI chips. Musk told investors in April that his company will increase the number of Nvidia\\u2019s flagship AI processors it uses from 35,000 to 85,000 by the end of this year. He wrote in a post on X earlier that month that the investment in training computers, gigantic data pipelines, and video storage will be well over $10 billion cumulatively this year.Such major investment and effort is not something all companies can handle however. \\u201cIt would be so hard for most traditional automakers to do this by themselves. The best way is to pick a supplier,\\u201d Liu said.The entry of Tesla\\u2019s FSD into China may feel like a new challenge therefore, but it may also coincide with a new era of partnerships around self-driving technologies.

In putting it together, we\\u2019ve tried to include a top pick for every type of photographer, whatever your skill level and budget.If we had to select an overall winner from our in-depth testing, we\\u2019d choose the Sony A7 IV: with a sharp full-frame sensor and supreme autofocus, it\\u2019s all the mirrorless camera that many people could want. It delivers the goods in pretty much any situation, which is why we also rate it as the best camera overall. Then again, it might be more \\u2013\\u00a0or less \\u2013 than you need.Our guide is designed to give you honest answers in your search for a new mirrorless camera. We\\u2019ve spent extensive hands-on time with each model, to get a feel for all the factors that make a camera great: how it feels in the hand, how it performs in different settings, and what the resulting images actually look like.

It\\u2019s overkill for beginners and more expensive than its stills-focused competition, but it\\u2019s also a versatile workhorse for anyone who want to shoot a mixture of photos and video. In our tests, we found the A7 IV to have class-leading autofocus skills (although Sony has since launched the pricier A7R V with its new AI autofocus chip and improved subject detection). It's buffer depth proved seemingly endless as well, meaning the camera can almost indefinitely maintain its maximum burst speeds. When using a CFexpress card, it swallowed 9fps for over a minute (or 6-7fps when continuously shooting raw).\\u00a0The A7 IV's new 33MP full-frame sensor doesn't dramatically improve image quality over the A7 III (the higher resolution also means fairly prevalent noise above ISO 6400), and there's a heavy crop on 4K footage. A price bump means it no longer occupies the same entry-level price bracket as its popular predecessor either, but upgrades like 10-bit video and a Bionz XR processor make it a much more powerful option. As a complete package, the Sony A7 IV is a solid all-rounder which could be the only mirrorless camera you'll ever need.Read our in-depth Sony A7 IV review^ Back to the topThe best mirrorless camera for beginnersImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)2.

From our tests, two features set the Canon EOS R10 apart for learners: its 15fps burst shooting rate and powerful subject-tracking autofocus, which operates across 651 AF points. These two features combine to make the R10 a fantastic performer in a range of scenarios, particularly when subjects are fast moving. We found it particularly good at tracking the eyes of subjects.It\\u2019s not a perfect camera for beginners: we found the EVF a little small and also noted the lack of image stabilization, a feature which is offered on rivals like the Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV (below). Then again, we also found that the R10\\u2019s low weight and deep grip make it a forgiving camera for novices to use. We also noted positively in our review the helpful presence of an AF joystick. The only major drawback is the lack of native lenses currently available for Canon\\u2019s RF mount. In all other respects, the R10 is a versatile option for photographers getting started.Read our in-depth Canon EOS R10 review^ Back to the topThe best mirrorless camera for prosImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)3.

If not, you'll save a packet by opting for the A7 IV instead.\\u00a0At 61MP, the Sony A7R V has the same class-leading resolution as the A7R IV before it. But thanks to a new sensor and powerful Bionz XR processing engine, our review found that the A7R V is a better camera overall. Paired with high-quality optics and up to eight stops of image stabilization, we found it capable of capturing outstanding detail. We found image quality to be excellent when shooting detailed subjects, making the A7R V a fantastic choice for landscape or studio pros.\\u00a0In our tests, its AI-powered Real-time Recognition AF wasn\\u2019t foolproof, but it could reliably lock onto a range of subjects, working particularly well with people \\u2013 even in wider scenes. Its articulating touchscreen provides useful flexibility when it comes to framing, while the EVF is as sharp here as on the A7S III. If you want a high-spec full-frame powerhouse and don\\u2019t mind paying for it, the A7R V is a serious step up from its predecessor. But if you can\\u2019t afford the best glass, want to shoot slow-mo 4K video or simply don\\u2019t need such high resolution, you might find better value in the A7 IV.Read our in-depth Sony A7R V review^ Back to the topThe best mirrorless camera for videoImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)4.

Like the S5, the S5 II is ticketed as a hybrid, but video is where it excels. In our tests, we found its 6K/30p footage rich and detailed, with wide dynamic range. Its video chops are bolstered by 10-bit recording across almost all resolutions, plus the ability to record uncropped footage using the sensor\\u2019s full 3:2 aspect ratio \\u2013 useful for cropping content. We also found it sturdy yet comfortable to handle during testing. Happily, its compact design doesn\\u2019t compromise the physical controls.The S5 II is Panasonic\\u2019s first mirrorless camera with phase detection AF for video. Combined with effective image stabilization, we found it produces sharp, stable video even when shooting handheld, although the 1.5x crop on 4K/60p video is a shame. The Panasonic Lumix GH6 is a more travel-friendly video powerhouse with a Micro Four Thirds sensor, while serious videographers will be drawn by the Lumix S5 IIX. Nevertheless, the S5 II is a fantastic full-frame hybrid for high-quality video.Read our in-depth Panasonic Lumix S5 II review^ Back to the topThe best crop-sensor mirrorless cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)5.

This image shot at ISO 10000. (Image credit: Future)Buy it if:\\u2705 You're a wildlife or sports photographer on a budget: Canon's subject-tracking and eye-recognition autofocus is game-changing for enthusiast action photographers.\\u2705 You also want a compact-sized all-rounder: The EOS R7 with 18-150mm kit lens is a compact package ideal for travelling.Don't buy it if:\\u274c You\\u2019re want decent lens choice: Rival Sony and Fujifilm APS-C mirrorless systems have a superior selection of lenses.\\u274c You need full-frame: There are lots of advantages to APS-C sensors especially for wildlife, but many people will simply desire a full-frame camera.The Canon EOS R7 is like one of the camera giant's full-frame EOS R cameras, only with a smaller APS-C sensor. For the price, it's impressively powerful, particularly if you're fan of shooting wildlife or sports scenes. That's because it boasts 15fps burst speeds (or 30fps if you switch to the electronic shutter). Our tests found that the EOS R7 can indeed hit these speeds, though you don't get the deep buffers found on full-frame siblings like the EOS R6, so it can't sustain those speeds for quite as long.Beyond rattling off frames of speeding animals, the EOS R7 offers comfortable handling, Canon's latest subject-tracking autofocus system and and dual UHS-II card slots, making it a camera that will also tempt pro EOS R series fans as a second body. The only downside? Canon has so far only made two native lenses for the EOS R7's APS-C sensor. More should be en route, though, and you can always mount existing RF lenses or adapt older EF lenses from Canon's DSLRs while you wait.To save some money on Canon products, check out our Canon discount codes.\\u00a0Read our in-depth Canon EOS R7 review^ Back to the topThe best retro mirrorless cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)6.

It packs the same specs as the Z50 into a body that's inspired by the Nikon FM2 from the early 1980s \\u2013 and the combination is a triumph for casual shooters who want a fun camera for travel and everyday shooting. It might lack a weather-proof build and the large grip seen on the Nikon Z50, but we found the Z fc to be a delight to shoot with.\\u00a0Its competitive specs, which include a 20.9MP sensor, the ability to shoot 4K/30p video, and continuous AF tracking for people and animals, are also borne out in reality.\\u00a0The only downside? A lack of native lenses. If a wide range of APS-C lenses is important to you, then Fujifilm's X-series is a good alternative \\u2013 but otherwise, the Nikon Z fc is a glorious mix of old and new. That said, if you have a little extra cash and are looking for a more rugged, full-frame retro camera, then the pricier Nikon Zf is the one for you.\\u00a0Read our in-depth Nikon Z fc review^ Back to the topThe best value mirrorless cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)7.

But in reality, it\\u2019s one of the best cameras for beginners who are mainly focused on stills rather than video. It might lack advanced features such as phase-detection autofocus or a microphone input, but it ticks all of the key boxes for beginners. A compact body and approachable button layout make it an accessible upgrade for smartphone photographers, as do Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity.\\u00a0In our tests, we found that the 20.3MP sensor to be plenty capable enough to capture consistently attractive images, while in-body image stabilization works a treat for shooting snaps at slower shutter speeds. The 121-point contrast detection autofocus won\\u2019t make headlines, but it does a decent job of consistently tracking faces and eyes. Add classic styling to the mix, plus a handy flip-down touchscreen and an Advanced Photo mode that makes it easy to experiment with complex techniques and the Mark IV proves itself a well-rounded beginner mirrorless option.Read our in-depth Olympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV review^ Back to the topThe best pro hybrid mirrorless cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)8.

But as a smaller, cheaper version of our camera of the year 2022, it\\u2019s one of the most capable mirrorless models you can buy right now. In testing, we found it every bit the capable hybrid camera, producing pin-sharp stills courtesy of its 45.7MP full-frame sensor, with fantastic 8K video to match. It doesn\\u2019t rival the 61MP resolution of the Sony A7R V, but the pixel difference makes the Nikon Z8 twice as fast.\\u00a0The Nikon Z8 follows the Z9 in excluding a mechanical sensor entirely, and reaps the performance rewards. During our review, we found 20fps burst shooting more than enough to capture action-packed moments, but the Z8 can go all the way to 120fps if you\\u2019re happy with 11MP output.\\u00a0We did find battery life a little limited in testing, and in-body image stabilization was simply fine. But by squeezing almost all of those flagship features into a significantly smaller body, at a lower price, we think the Nikon Z8 offers a recipe that will make more sense for most people than the Z9.Read our in-depth Nikon Z8 review^ Back to the topThe best medium format mirrorless cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Tim Coleman / TechRadar)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Tim Coleman / TechRadar)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)9.

It doesn't even record video.While it\\u2019s very much a camera for photography purists, the Hasselblad X2D 100C is also the most versatile and accessible Hasselblad to date. It squeezes a medium format sensor into a stunning body that we found surprisingly compact and comfortable to handle. We also appreciated the convenience of its built-in 1TB of SSD storage. That\\u2019s not to say it doesn\\u2019t occupy a narrow niche: there\\u2019s no video, burst shooting tops out at 3.3fps, and even with speed enhancements, its autofocus still lags far behind the latest mirrorless models. And if you like telephoto lenses, there's no obvious option from Hasselblad.Yet despite these drawbacks, we found its manageable form factor and tilt-angle touchscreen made it usable in the real world, while its in-body image stabilization \\u2013 a first for Hasselblad \\u2013 eliminated the need for a tripod. Its 100MP sensor can capture pin-sharp stills, while its leaf shutter setup permits greater use of wide apertures with flash portraits. Color rendition and dynamic range are outstanding, too.

By inheriting the 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor from the X-S10 and X-T4, the X-S20 benefits from a proven imaging system, while Fuji\\u2019s latest X-Processor 5 works efficiently with the bigger battery to extend longevity. The X-S20 enhances things further by offering 6K/30p 4:2:2 10-bit internal video recording, which is more than most casual content creators will need.Adopting the balanced body of the X-S10, it handles comfortably. Our first impressions found that simplified dials make it easier for learners to operate. A new Vlog mode, plus automatic scene detection and better subject tracking, also ease the way for beginners. We do think many novices will be wary of its increased price tag, with the X-S10 still available for less. We also wish that Fuji had weather-sealed the X-S20. All the same, with a generous feature set \\u2013 including in-body image stabilization that worked well for handheld shooting in our review \\u2013 the result is a very capable all-rounder for both stills and video.Read our in-depth Fujifilm X-S20 review^ Back to the topThe best mirrorless camera for actionImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)11.

Its electronic shutter delivers burst speeds of up to 40fps, while its subject-tracking autofocus makes it easily the best Fuji X-series camera for shooting fast-moving scenes. Videographers are also rewarded with a superlative skill set. The X-H2S can record detailed 6.2K/30p footage internally, with countless color profiles for editing flexibility. In-body image stabilization and a sharp articulating touchscreen complement the package.We think it\\u2019s overkill for photographers who won\\u2019t utilise its blistering pace, and there\\u2019s no escaping its serious price tag. That said, it\\u2019s a more realistic alternative to the Nikon Z9. And while it costs the same as full-frame rivals such as the Sony A7 IV, not other APS-C camera can compete with its feature set or the performance of its stacked sensor.Read our in-depth Fujifilm X-H2S review^ Back to the topHow to choose the best mirrorless camera for youIt's a great time to buy a mirrorless camera, but also a slightly overwhelming one. An explosion in the number of options available at all price points from the likes of Canon, Sony, Nikon, Fujifilm, Panasonic and a reborn Olympus means that photographers and videographers have never had more choice.\\u00a0So where to start? Sensor size is often a good barometer of a camera's character and shooting style. Models that are built for professionals and keen amateurs will have either a full-frame sensor or a slightly smaller APS-C chip. The latter tend to be smaller and more affordable than full-frame cameras, if not quite as portable as those with Four Thirds sensors (from Panasonic and Olympus).Other important features to look out for are electronic viewfinders (EVFs), which bump up the price but are nigh-on essential for most photographers. It's also worth considering what kind of lenses you'll need.\\u00a0If you like to specialize in a particular area (for example, wide-angle architecture or macro), then check the system you're looking at to make sure it has the right options for you. In the full-frame mirrorless space, Sony offers the most choice right now, while on crop-sensor APS-C cameras Fujifilm has a wide range of options at most focal lengths.(Image credit: Future)Mirrorless or DSLR: what's the difference?The mirrorless vs DSLR debate has been a hot topic since the arrival of the first mirror-free cameras. Which is best for you will always be a personal choice, although most manufacturers are now focused on pouring their best tech into mirrorless models. Our dedicated mirrorless vs DSLR guide should help you decide which one is right for your needs, but there are a few key ways in which the two formats are different.Mirrorless cameras allow you to change lenses like a DSLR. But unlike a DSLR, they don\\u2019t use a mirror to direct light onto the sensor inside. Instead, light is received and processed by the sensor directly. Because they don\\u2019t need a bulky mirror, they can be made more compact than a traditional DSLR. No mirror to move also means faster potential shutter speeds.The other key difference is the viewfinder. Where DLSR cameras use an optical viewfinder to help you frame scenes, mirrorless cameras rely either on an electronic equivalent, or require you to compose using their rear screen. While the latter can be problematic in bright conditions, the former is no longer the dealbreaker it once was: modern EVFs are bright and sharp, giving you a realistic preview in real-time, with the benefit of data readouts.Mirrorless cameras initially featured smaller sensors than DSLR cameras, but today you\\u2019ll find a catalogue of mirrorless models with full-frame and APS-C sensors. This means there\\u2019s no clear difference in image quality between the best DSLR and mirrorless cameras.(Image credit: Future)Why are mirrorless cameras better?Is a mirrorless camera better than a DSLR? There are still quite a few pros and cons to both designs, so if you want to find out more, read our Mirrorless vs DSLR cameras guide.Mirrorless cameras certainly offer more choice. If you're looking to buy a DSLR, there's only really two main players in the shape of Canon and Nikon. If you opt for a mirrorless camera, the choice of brands is much broader, with the likes of Canon, Panasonic, Fujifilm, Sony, Olympus and Leica all offering a wide range of cameras to suit most budgets.\\u00a0Right now, every major camera manufacturer has something to shout about, and their latest models are different enough from their rivals to stand out in some way.While it would be very easy to select 10 high-end models to make up our pick of the best mirrorless camera, we've tried to pick out some more affordable options as well. These models might not be dripping with features, but they represent great options for new users and those on a budget. That said, if you're looking specifically for a budget mirrorless camera, take a look at our best beginner mirrorless camera guide.So whether you're after a better camera than the one featured on your smartphone or are looking for an advanced, high-end model to push your creativity even further, read on to find out what are the best mirrorless cameras you can buy right now.\\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Are mirrorless cameras good for beginners?While flagship mirrorless cameras might be designed to fulfil the needs of enthusiasts and professionals, the best entry-level mirrorless cameras offer everything a beginner could ask for at the start of their photography journey.Many of our favorite beginner mirrorless cameras are lightweight and easy for learners to handle, while still offering the sort of performance that will allow you to grow as a photographer. The exact specs will vary from camera to camera, but the core components usually include a capable sensor and reliable autofocus.Besides striking a balance between price and performance, most mirrorless cameras are user-friendly for beginners, thanks to their touchscreen interfaces. Even if you\\u2019re a complete novice, these should feel familiar if you\\u2019re upgrading from a smartphone.By choosing a beginner mirrorless camera, you won\\u2019t generally get all of the more advanced features found on premium models. That sacrifice could be in-body image stabilization, burst shooting speeds, or perhaps the frame rate at which a camera can record 4K video footage. Still, mirrorless cameras remain a versatile choice for new photographers. And because their lenses are interchangeable, you\\u2019ll be able to upgrade to different glass as your skills improve.We\\u2019ve picked out a handful of our favorite mirrorless starter cameras in the \\u2018Novices\\u2019 section above, but you can find an in-depth selection by reading our dedicated round-up of the best beginner mirrorless cameras. There you\\u2019ll find options for every budget and preference, ranging from the best entry-level all-rounders to video-focused mirrorless hybrids for budding vloggers.How we test mirrorless cameras(Image credit: Future)Why you can trust TechRadar\\u2611\\ufe0f 100s of cameras reviewed\\u2611\\ufe0f 15 years of product testing\\u2611\\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\\u2611\\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing techBuying a mirrorless camera these days isn't cheap, so every camera in this guide has been tested extensively by us. These days, real-world tests are the most revealing way to understand a camera's performance and character, so we focus heavily on those, along with standardized tests for factors like ISO performance.To begin with, we look at the camera's design, handling and controls to get a sense of what kind of photographer it's aimed at and who might most enjoy shooting with it. When we take it out on a shoot, we'll use it both handheld and on a tripod to get a sense of where its strengths lie, and test its startup speed.To test performance, we use a formatted memory card (the fastest supported type be it UHS-I, UHS-II, CFexpress A or B, and so on) and shoot in both raw and JPEG (if available). For continuity we use the same camera settings (1/250 sec, ISO 200, continuous AF) when testing the real performance of the camera's continuous high burst mode for high speed photography. We'll also look at how quickly the buffers clears and repeat the test for both raw and JPEG files.(Image credit: Future)In various lighting conditions, we also test the camera's different autofocus modes (including Face and Eye AF) in single point, area and continuous modes. We also shoot a range of photos of different styles (portrait, landscape, low light, macro/close-up) in raw and JPEG to get a sense of metering and its sensor's ability to handle noise and resolve fine detail.If the camera's raw files are supported by Adobe Camera Raw, we'll also process some test images to see how we can push areas like shadow recovery. And we'll also test its ISO performance across the whole range to get a sense of the levels we'd be happy to push the camera to.Official CIPA ratings helpfully estimate the camera's expected battery life but the reality is often different \\u2013 for better or worse \\u2013 and so we run our own real-world tests, making sure the screen brightness is in its factory setting. Once the battery has reached zero, we'll then count the number of shots to see how it compares to the camera's CIPA rating. Finally, we test the camera's video skills by shooting some test footage at different frame-rates and resolutions, along with its companion app.We then take everything we've learned about the camera and factor in its price to get a sense of the value-for-money it offers, before reaching our final verdict.Best cameras for photographyBest camera for beginnersBest beginner DSLR camerasBest DSLRBest 4K cameraBest full-frame cameraBest compact cameraWhat camera should I buy?Mirrorless vs DSLR: 10 key differencesCamera rumorsRound up of today's best dealsSony A7 IV $2,699.99 $2,298ViewSee all pricesDeal ends Mon, Jul 22, 2024Canon EOS R10 $879ViewSee all pricesLow StockSony A7R V $488.20ViewSee all pricesPanasonic Lumix S5II $1,999.99 $1,697.99ViewSee all pricesCanon EOS R7 $1,399ViewSee all pricesNikon Z fc $956.95 $856.95ViewSee all pricesOlympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV $699.99ViewSee all pricesNikon Z8 $3,496.95ViewSee all pricesHasselblad X2D 100C $8,199ViewSee all pricesFujifilm X-S20 $1,299ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Timothy ColemanSocial Links NavigationCameras editorTim is the Cameras editor at TechRadar.

How we testHere\\u2019s something we\\u2019ve learned from hundreds of camera reviews: when it comes to choosing the best camera for photography, there\\u2019s no one right answer for everyone. Sure, we can recommend our favorite stills camera. But the best choice for you will depend on what and how you like to shoot. That\\u2019s why our list below covers everything from the best travel cameras to top options for sports photography.If we had to pick the camera most likely to work for everyone, it would be the Sony A7 IV. Based on many hours of in-depth testing, we\\u2019ve found it to be a well-rounded full-frame camera with impressive autofocus performance and excellent image quality. But we know it won\\u2019t be perfect for everyone. If you\\u2019re new to photography, for example, we think you\\u2019d be much better off with something like the Canon EOS R10, which is our favorite camera for beginners.We suggest reading all of our expert guide to get a full picture of the cameras available in 2024. Every entry below offers a summary of our testing feedback, based on extensive real-world reviews. Our experienced team checks everything from handling and build quality to autofocus and image quality \\u2013\\u00a0all to form a picture of what and who each camera model is good for.

With a new 33MP sensor that\\u2019s solid for both stills and video, it\\u2019s a compelling mirrorless option for hybrid shooters. In our review, we called it a \\\"brilliant blend of photographic power and video versatility\\\". A price hike does mean it\\u2019s no longer an entry-level full-frame camera like its forebear, but a Bionz XR processor powers solid performance that broadly justifies the extra expenditure.\\u00a0The A7 IV also benefits from Sony\\u2019s class-leading autofocus skills, plus upgrades like 10-bit video and an almost endless buffer depth with a CFexpress card. Our tests found this buffer to be more generous than most photographers will need, with image quality leaning more towards resolution than low-light performance.\\u00a0There are compromises elsewhere, as well: there's a heavy crop on 4K footage and it isn't the simplest camera for beginners to use. The Canon EOS R6 also offers faster burst speeds for a similar price. But considering its powerful versatility and higher resolution, the Sony A7 IV deservedly takes our number one spot.\\u00a0Read our in-depth Sony A7 IV review^ Back to the topThe best pro camera for stills(Image credit: Future)2.

If not, you'll save a packet by opting for the A7 IV instead.\\u00a0The Sony A7R V takes up the mantle from the\\u00a0A7R IV\\u00a0as Sony\\u2019s sharpest full-frame mirrorless camera. As we found in our review, it also solves several of the A7R IV\\u2019s drawbacks to become a more complete professional camera. A new 61MP sensor and Bionz XR processor team up to deliver remarkably detailed stills. Eight stops of image stabilization made it easy to shoot handheld in testing, too. We were also impressed by the effectiveness of Real-rime Recognition AF. It\\u2019s not perfect, but it can generally detect a range of subjects and capture them crisply.From our time with the A7R V, we think its level of detail makes it best suited to landscape and studio work. Do keep in mind that it only produces its best results when paired with top-spec lenses, which will add heavily to the already high price tag. The A7R IV offers the same resolution, but we do think the A7R V is the better camera overall, particularly with a sharper EVF that makes framing a joy. That said, if you don\\u2019t need so many sensor pixels, you\\u2019ll find better value for less elsewhere.Read our in-depth Sony A7R V review^ Back to the topThe best mirrorless camera for beginners(Image credit: Future)3.

This isn'y a vlogging camera.It isn't the cheapest option for beginners, but we think the Canon EOS R10 is the best camera for those starting their photographic journey. Spiritual successor to Canon's popular mid-range DSLRs, the EOS R10 has two standout skills: impressive subject-tracking autofocus and speedy 15fps burst shooting, which was previously unheard of at this price. Both combine nicely to make the EOS R10 a versatile little camera for shooting all kinds of subjects, from portraits to speeding pets. During our autofocus testing, which we conducted on cats, deer and a rapid cockapoodle, the R10 found and tracked subjects' eyes very well, with 15fps burst speeds producing a decent hit rate.\\u00a0While it isn't a compact camera, the EOS R10 is lightweight at 429g and has a deep grip that makes it well-balanced in the hand with all kinds of lenses. Unfortunately, the EOS R10 doesn't yet have many native lenses (just two at the time of writing) and lacks in-body image stabilization. But if you're happy to buy some of the many full-frame RF lenses that work well with the camera, or adapt old ones using an EF-EOS R adapter, then it's a versatile sidekick that's ideal for fledgling snappers.Read our in-depth Canon EOS R10 review^ Back to the topThe best APS-C camera for enthusiasts(Image credit: Future)4.

This image shot at ISO 10000. (Image credit: Future)Buy it if:\\u2705 You want performance on a budget: If you can't shell out for Canon's full-frame models, the EOS R7 is a more affordable route to excellent subject-tracking autofocus.\\u2705 You want a travel-friendly camera: Its small proportions and fantastic handling make the EOS R7 a lovely all-rounder to travel with.Don't buy it if:\\u274c You want to buy a lot of native lenses: At the time of writing, the native RF-S lens range is limited; rivals like the Sony A6600 and Fujifilm X-H2S are better served.\\u274c You want the full-frame experience: The EOS R7 works wonders with its APS-C sensor, but it can't compete with full-frame alternatives when it comes to low light.If you don\\u2019t need full-frame, we think there\\u2019s no crop sensor camera that can currently beat the Canon EOS R7. In our review, we highlighted its superb autofocus performance, excellent in-body image stabilization and the class-leading detail delivered by its 32.5MP sensor.\\u00a0Its full-frame cousins still have the edge in low light, but the EOS R7 produced lovely images across a range of scenarios in our real-world tests. We were also impressed by its 30fps burst speeds, which make it a great choice for sports and wildlife enthusiasts.Our tests also found the EOS R7 a nice camera to hold and use, with a decent grip and generous spread of direct-access controls. Dual UHS-II card slots are a welcome bonus, while the ability to record uncropped 4K/60p video output makes the EOS R7 a tidy all-rounder. The only major drawback at present is the continued lack of native lenses, an issue not suffered by alternative APS-C cameras such as the Sony A6700 and Fujifilm X-T5.Read our in-depth Canon EOS R7 review^ Back to the topThe best Micro Four Thirds camera for enthusiasts(Image credit: OM System)5.

The OM System OM-1 II is a flagship MFT model and compelling alternative for photographers who prioritize size, versatility and a fun handheld experience. Thanks to its stacked Micro Four Thirds sensor inherited from the OM-1, and a speedy TruePix X processor, the OM-1 performed superbly in most of our tests, especially wildlife photography. It has a swathe of subject detection modes, for example you'd struggle to find a more capable autofocus system for bird photography.\\u00a0There's also unique computational photography modes that are the best you'll find outside a smartphone, with the likes of High Res Shot, Live ND and in-camera Focus Stacking going some way to compensating for its smaller sensor.\\u00a0OM System also added Live Grad ND \\u2013 a graduated filter perfect for landscape photography.\\u00a0It's not all good news, though. This second-gen model is but a mere refresh of the now cheaper OM-1, we think it's updates could have been added to the OM-1 by a firmware update rather than making a new, pricier model. The MFT sensor and 20MP resolution are modest for a camera at this price, with low light image quality not quite up to the level of full-frame rivals. If you can overlook those drawbacks, then the OM-1 II (and its huge range of Micro Four Thirds lenses) will make a fine companion.\\u00a0Quite simply, it's the one of the most enjoyable cameras you can buy.\\u00a0Read our in-depth OM System OM-1 II review^ Back to the topThe best premium compact(Image credit: Future)6.

Wait times to get delivery are significantly reduced after it's unprecedented pre-order numbers \\u2013 influenced by its out-of-stock and viral predecessor, the Fujifilm X100V.

You also get Fujifilm's best autofocus, boprrowed from the Fujifilm X-T5.\\u00a0You might not need the increased pixel count because the X100V's 26MP is plenty enough for most people. However, the extra resolution offers greater flexibility for cropping into your pictures. The X100VI is also a more capable filmmaking tool, armed with 6.2K 10-bit video. It's not a perfect camera: we think Fujifilm should have implemented a new 28mm lens, while there's only one UHS-I SD card slot and you still need an adaptor for full weather-proofing. It's also a pricier camera than the X100V. However, we think the X100VI is Fujifilm's most compelling cmaera and the best premium compact for everyday use.\\u00a0Read our in-depth Fujifilm X100VI review^ Back to the topThe best value camera for photography(Image credit: Future)7.

Taking the baton from the hugely successful Nikon D3400, it brings a 24MP APS-C sensor and an incredible 1,550-shot battery life that beats the stamina of most mirrorless cameras by about three times.\\u00a0The useful Guide mode is there to walk beginners through creating effects like a blurred background, while the Nikon DX system has a vast array of lenses. If you're starting out, we'd recommend buying the D3500 with the AF-P DX 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR lens, as its brings handy vibration reduction for very little extra cost. Those looking for a travel-friendly camera should still consider mirrorless alternatives like the Fujifilm X-T200 and Canon EOS M50 Mark II, but otherwise this remains a brilliant way to learn the photographic basics and start your new hobby.Read our in-depth Nikon D3500 review^ Back to the topThe best instant camera(Image credit: Future)9.

As the first pro-grade camera without a mechanical shutter, it was a groundbreaking model at launch. Subsequent firmware releases have only made it better. Alongside reliable Eye AF tracking, the Z9 is capable of capturing crisp video at 8K/60p or 4K/120fps. Our tests confirmed that stills are similarly fantastic, with the 45.7MP stacked CMOS sensor and excellent image stabilization combining to produce beautiful images.Besides the price, the major drawback is the Z9's form factor. In our review, we found it a big, heavyweight beast. A two-way tilting touchscreen does add welcome versatility alongside the vertical grip, and weather-sealing complements Nikon's trademark build quality. But there are smaller, more affordable options out there if you don't need all of its flagship features.

Larger isn't always better, but it is a good guide to what kind of camera it is, how expensive the lenses will be, and who it's aimed at. In general, Micro Four Thirds and APS-C cameras are for both hobbyists and pros, while full-frame models tend to be strictly for advanced photographers with bigger budgets. Compact cameras with 1-inch sensors are for travel zooms and everyday photography.\\u00a0Other features to look out for are viewfinders (electronic or optical), which are considered essential by most photographers, and handling. If you're likely to want to use longer lenses, then a good grip is essential. You should also consider which lenses you're likely to need for your favorite types of photography \\u2013 for example, bright prime lenses are better for portraits and street shooting, while wide-angle zooms are more useful for landscapes. Deciding which camera system, including lenses, is the best for you is often better than choosing a camera in isolation.(Image credit: Future)What type of camera is best for photography?As you\\u2019ll find in our comprehensive buying guide above, there\\u2019s no single factor that defines what type of camera is best for photography. From sensor size to resolution, there are many aspects to bear in mind when choosing a stills camera, which is why it\\u2019s a good idea to consider the feedback from our real-world tests when deciding.The importance of each of these factors will come down to your preferred style of shooting. Objectively speaking, the larger a camera\\u2019s sensor, the more light it can gather \\u2013 and the higher its resolution, the sharper its images will be. That\\u2019s why we rate mirrorless cameras such as the Sony A1 so highly for their stills performance: its 50.1MP full-frame sensor is the class of the field.But the question isn\\u2019t necessarily that simple. The highest resolutions tend to be overkill unless you\\u2019re a professional photographer. Equally, full-frame cameras are less travel-friendly due to the size of their sensors. For that reason, you might prefer a mirrorless camera with a high-resolution APS-C sensor, such as the Fujifilm X-H2. Or if you\\u2019re just starting out, the best photography camera for you could be an APS-C model with a lower resolution, such as the Canon EOS R10.The elephant in the room is whether a DLSR is better than a mirrorless camera for photography. For a full analysis of this question, it\\u2019s worth reading our mirrorless vs DSLR camera guide. The short summary is that most manufacturers regard mirrorless cameras as the future of photography, with the latest models offering unrivalled performance and results. But that doesn\\u2019t necessarily mean you should discount DSLR models, as you can read below.(Image credit: Future)Are DSLRs best for photography?DSLRs have long been a byword for 'serious' photography, but they're no longer at the top the camera tech tree. Mirrorless cameras, which replace the DSLR's optical viewfinder with a wholly electronic EVF, are now the beneficiaries of the camera giants' latest lenses and autofocus systems. Neither Canon nor Nikon has released a new DSLR in years. That's why our list above is dominated by mirrorless cameras, rather than DSLRs.\\u00a0That doesn't necessarily mean you shouldn't consider buying a DSLR for photography. Their main benefit now is value for money \\u2013\\u00a0their lack of an electronic viewfinder means they're usually cheaper than mirrorless equivalents, and their maturity means they have a wide range of affordable lenses. Classic DSLRs like the Canon EOS 6D are also excellent second-hand buys. But the smarter long-term investments are now mirrorless cameras.(Image credit: TechRadar)How we test camerasWhy you can trust TechRadar\\u2611\\ufe0f 100s of cameras reviewed\\u2611\\ufe0f 15 years of product testing\\u2611\\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\\u2611\\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing techThe best cameras for photography don't going to come cheap these days, and so it's important to read up on real-world tests such as TechRadar's which are the most revealing way to understand a camera's performance and character, so we focus heavily on those, along with standardized tests for factors like ISO performance.To start with, we look at the camera's design, handling and controls to get a sense of what kind of photographer it's aimed at and who would most enjoy shooting with it. When we take it out on a shoot, we'll use it both handheld and on a tripod to get a sense of where its strengths lie, and test its startup speed.Regarding performance, we use the fastest supported memory card type (whether that's UHS-I, UHS-II, CFexpress and so on) and make sure it's formatted, then shoot photos in both raw and JPEG (if available). We have standardized camera settings to test burst shooting (1/250 sec, ISO 200, continuous AF) \\u2013 we then select the various burst shooting modes and shoot sequences in front of a stopwatch to record how long sequences last, the number of frame and how quickly the buffers clears, repeating the test for both raw and JPEG files.In various lighting conditions, we also test the camera's different autofocus modes (including Face and Eye AF) in single point, area and continuous modes. We also shoot a range of photos of different styles (portrait, landscape, low light, macro/close-up) in raw and JPEG to get a sense of metering and its sensor's ability to handle noise and resolve fine detail.(Image credit: Future)If the camera's raw files are supported by Adobe Camera Raw, we'll also process some test images to see how we can push areas like shadow recovery. And we'll also test its ISO performance across the whole range to get a sense of the levels we'd be happy to push the camera to.Battery life is another important consideration. We start our test with a fully charged battery and run our usual camera testing until the battery has reached zero. We then count how many shots were possible and check that number against the camera's official CIPA rating \\u2013 the results can differ for better or for worse. Finally, we test the camera's video skills by shooting some test footage at different frame-rates and resolutions, along with its companion app.We then take everything we've learned about the camera and factor in its price to get a sense of the value-for-money it offers, before reaching our final verdict.Best mirrorless cameraBest camera for beginnersBest beginner DSLR camerasBest DSLRBest 4K cameraBest full-frame cameraBest compact cameraWhat camera should I buy?Mirrorless vs DSLR: 10 key differencesCamera rumorsRound up of today's best dealsSony A7 IV $2,699.99 $2,298ViewSee all pricesDeal ends Mon, Jul 22, 2024Low StockSony A7R V $488.20ViewSee all pricesCanon EOS R10 $879ViewSee all pricesCanon EOS R7 $1,399ViewSee all pricesOM System OM-1 II $2,399.99ViewSee all pricesFujifilm X100VI $2,595ViewSee all pricesOlympus OM-D E-M10 Mark IV $699.99ViewSee all pricesNikon D3500 $905ViewSee all pricesFujifilm Instax Mini 12 $79.95 $73.15ViewSee all pricesNikon Z9 $5,496.95ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Timothy ColemanSocial Links NavigationCameras editorTim is the Cameras editor at TechRadar.

Here\\u2019s how it works.(Image credit: Samsung)Jump to:Cut to the chaseSpecificationsPrice and release dateDesignSensors and hardwareAI and featuresSamsung has arrived in the smart ring market with the introduction of the Samsung Galaxy Ring. It offers a host of different health and fitness tracking features, in a compact form factor that's much less obtrusive than a smartwatch.Here we've pulled together everything you need to know about the Galaxy Ring, from how much it's going to cost you, to the features you get in return for your money. If you're thinking about investing in one, this should help you make a decision.You can read our hands-on Samsung Galaxy Ring review here, while you should also be aware of the best smart rings offered by Samsung's competitors, so you can make sure you're picking the one that's right for you.Samsung Galaxy Ring: Cut to the chaseWhat is it?\\u00a0Samsung's first-ever smart ringWhen is it on sale?

Whatever size of ring you go for, it'll cost you $399 / \\u00a3399 (that's around AU$750, though pricing in Australia is to be confirmed). You get the ring and its charging case for your money.How does that match up to its major competitors? Well, the third-generation Oura Ring is perhaps the best-known rival to the Samsung smart ring, and that will set you back $299 / \\u00a3329 / AU$599. However, you do really need a subscription to make the most of the Oura Ring, and that's $5.99 / \\u00a34.99 / AU$9.99 a month after the first six months.None of the features of the Samsung Galaxy Ring are locked behind a subscription, and Samsung hasn't intimated that one is going to be introduced anytime soon. You will need the Samsung Health app on your smartphone though, so the Galaxy Ring is best paired up with one of the best Samsung phones.Samsung Galaxy Ring: Design(Image credit: Future / Matt Evans)There's only so much variation that's possible with a smart ring, and the design of the Galaxy Ring doesn't offer too many surprises in that regard. It's made from super-strong titanium, with a width of 7mm and a thickness of 2.6mm. It's available in standard US ring sizes from 5 to 13, with the weight ranging from 2.3 grams to 3 grams accordingly.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Before you get your smart ring delivered, Samsung will send you a sizing kit to make sure you buy the right size wearable for your finger. This is standard procedure for smart rings, and prevents you from buying a gadget that isn't actually going to fit.You've got three different finishes to choose from, which are Titanium Black, Titanium Silver, and Titanium Gold. One design innovation that is here is the use of a concave shape, curving very slightly in on your finger like an hourglass. Samsung says this helps to prevent scratches and wear and tear, as indeed does the use of titanium. It's got 10ATM and IP68 ratings, which protect it against water immersion and dust.There's no display on the Samsung Galaxy Ring (though there might be on the Galaxy Ring 2), and there are no buttons either \\u2013 everything is handled through the Samsung Health app, whether you want to check up on battery life or get your daily step count. The ring is IP68 rated for water and dust protection, and is water resistant to 100 meters.Speaking of battery life, the Galaxy Ring comes with a square charging case that's not unlike the kind of box you would put an engagement ring inside (though perhaps a bit more techy in style). The box is transparent, and is the same no matter which color of ring you order. The case itself charges up via a USB-C cable or wirelessly.Samsung Galaxy Ring: Sensors and Hardware(Image credit: Future / Matt Evans)Samsung has made the Galaxy Ring to be the sort of device you set up and then forget about, just like all the best sleep trackers. It'll work in the background taking measurements of your steps, heart rate, workouts, and all the other basic tracking you'd expect. Blood oxygen and skin temperature can be recorded too.The Galaxy Ring monitors your sleep as well, which Samsung is promoting as one of the key features of the wearable. As with the Galaxy Watch 7, you get a wealth of insights into your sleeping patterns, and an assessment of your sleep chronotype \\u2013 the type of sleeper you are, essentially, which is represented by a cute animal.Walking and running can both be logged automatically, while other types of activity have to be manually recorded. Again, that's done using the Samsung Health app, where you can also record information on your dietary habits and any medications you're taking.Something more out of the ordinary you can do with the Samsung Galaxy Ring is to use it as a gesture control device for a connected Galaxy phone. You can, for example, wave to dismiss an alarm or pinch your fingers together to take a photo \\u2013 it's a little something extra that might make you choose this over another smart ring (and might make you stay in the Samsung ecosystem).As for battery life, the battery capacity depends on the size of the ring you get, and can vary from 18mAh to 23.5mAh. The charging case, meanwhile, has a capacity of 361mAh. On its own, the ring can last up to a week between charges, while the case gives you an additional 5-6 full charges on top of that.AI and features(Image credit: Samsung)Samsung stuffed a whole host of Galaxy AI features into the Galaxy S24 phones earlier this year, so it's perhaps no surprise that the Galaxy Ring has been given some artificial intelligence tricks as well.First up there's an Energy Score, which uses AI algorithms to crunch the data being logged by your wearable (including activity levels and heart rate), and gives you a better understanding of your overall health and wellness.You also get a Sleep Score as well, which works in the same way: personalized, detailed insights into what all the numbers in your records actually point to. This is already available on recent Samsung Galaxy watches.On top of that we have a new AI-powered feature called Wellness Tips: tell the Samsung Health app your goals (like \\\"a more consistent sleep routine\\\" or \\\"better overall fitness\\\") and you'll get some custom advice just for you. The idea is that you can actually act on all the data gathered by your Galaxy Ring.Today's best Samsung Galaxy Watch 5 dealsSamsung Galaxy Watch 5 $449.99 $249.99ViewSee all pricesSamsung Galaxy Watch Charging Cradle $24.99ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricesDavid NieldSocial Links NavigationFreelance ContributorDave is a freelance tech journalist who has been writing about gadgets, apps and the web for more than two decades.

And expect a lot of AI, likely in the form of Google Gemini.\\u00a0So read on for everything we've heard about the Google Pixel 9 phones so far, as well as a rundown of what we'd like to see from the next-generation Google phone.\\u00a0Latest newsGoogle has shown off part of the Pixel 9 Pro in a teaser.Cut to the chaseWhat is it?

Apparently in France this will start at 899 euros for 128GB of storage, rising to 999 euros for 256GB. Those prices are 100 euros and 140 euros respectively more than the current model.However, the leaked prices for the Pixel 9 Pro are similar to last year, albeit slightly higher for increased storage capacities.And we've also seen leaked prices for the Pixel 9 Pro XL, which is said to cost 1,199 euros for 128GB of storage, 1,299 euros for 256GB, 1,429 euros for 512GB, and 1,689 euros for 1TB. This is a new rumored model, but that would make it the most expensive non-foldable Pixel yet.However, a leak suggests that the standard Pixel 9 will come with six months of Gemini Advanced, while the Pixel 9 Pro, Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Pixel 9 Pro Fold may come with a full year, so that could take some of the sting out of these prices.Google Pixel 9: potential modelsThe Pixel 8 Pro (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)Expect a Pixel 9, a Pixel 9 Pro, and a Pixel 9 Pro FoldA Pixel 9 Pro XL might join themOne of the most interesting (and earliest) Pixel 9 rumors points to there being a third model in the series, with the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro being joined by another phone that has roughly the same screen size as the Pixel 9, but the improved specs expected of a Pro model.So in other words it would see Google take a similar approach to Apple with its Pro line of iPhones (except there\\u2019s no suggestion that you\\u2019ll be able to get a big-screen Pixel without getting a Pro model, as you can from Apple in the shape of the iPhone 15 Plus).This leak came from \\u201can anonymous but trustworthy source\\u201d speaking to Android Authority in December 2022. While we\\u2019d always take such early leaks with a pinch of salt, it\\u2019s worth noting that this leak also included details of the Pixel 8 line, and almost all of these have since proved accurate, so the source seems credible.We've also seen leaked benchmarks for a device supposedly called the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL \\u2013 could this be the mysterious third device? In which case, this might have the specs we'd typically expect from a 'Pro' model, with the Pixel 9 Pro itself having a smaller screen.Beyond that, Google has also confirmed that the Pixel Fold 2 will launch as the Pixel 9 Pro Fold, so that can be considered part of the Pixel 9 line too.Google Pixel 9: potential design and displayThe Pixel 8 Pro (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)There could be a whole new designThere might additionally be a smaller 6.3-inch Pro modelGoogle itself has shown off part of the Pixel 9 Pro, in a teaser video. You can see an image from this below.Details include a new camera block design and a matte coating rather than a glossy finish.(Image credit: Google)Beyond that, the leaker who predicted that we\\u2019d see three Pixel 9 models also claimed to know their screen sizes, saying the Pixel 9 will have roughly the same screen size as the Pixel 8 (which has a 6.2-inch display), while the Pixel 9 Pro will be around the same size as the Pixel 8 Pro (at 6.7 inches), and the unnamed third model will have a 6.3-inch screen.However, this is slightly at odds with a more recent claim, with reputable leaker Ross Young saying shortly after the Pixel 8\\u2019s launch that the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro will both have bigger screens than the Pixel 8 and Pixel 8 Pro.They also, incidentally, claim that the Pixel 9a and Pixel 9 Pro Fold will have bigger screens than their predecessors.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: MySmartPrice / OnLeaks)(Image credit: MySmartPrice / OnLeaks)To further confuse things though, an even more recent leak (this time from reliable leaker OnLeaks and MySmartPrice) points to the Pixel 9 Pro having a roughly 6.5-inch screen, making it smaller than the current model.This leak also includes detailed renders of the Pixel 9 Pro, some of which you can see above.You'll notice that the design has drastically changed if these images are accurate, with flat rather than curved sides shown, and a new camera design, which has now been confirmed by Google.The leak also includes dimensions, which are apparently 162.7 x 76.6 x 8.5mm (rising to 12mm at the camera bump). That's very similar to the Pixel 8 Pro, which comes in at 162.6 x 76.5 x 8.8mm.Image 1 of 2(Image credit: OnLeaks / 91Mobiles)(Image credit: OnLeaks / 91Mobiles)The source of this has since returned with renders of the standard Pixel 9 too (above), this time in collaboration with 91Mobiles.These show the same new design as the Pixel 9 Pro, and apparently this phone has a 6.1-inch screen (also making it smaller than its 6.2-inch predecessor), but is slightly larger (though slimmer) overall at 152.8 x 71.9 x 8.5mm (or 12.0mm including the camera bump).\\u00a0You can also see that there's a third camera lens on the rear, which is absent from the Pixel 8.We've also now seen leaked photos of the Pixel 9 Pro, followed from the same source by leaked hands-on photos of all three rumored Pixel 9 models, some of which you can see below.Image 1 of 3(Image credit: Rozetked)(Image credit: Rozetked)(Image credit: Rozetked)These match the leaked images above, and the source also included some specs. They claim that the Pixel 9 has a 6.24-inch screen, the Pixel 9 Pro has a 6.34-inch display, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 6.73-inch screen, and that all three have a 120Hz refresh rate.They additionally claim that the Pixel 9 has a wide and ultra-wide camera on the back, with the Pro models adding a 5x telephoto to the mix, and that all three sensors on the Pro models are 50MP.A Tensor G4 chipset is mentioned, as expected, and all three phones reportedly start at 128GB of storage, with the Pixel 9 apparently having 12GB of RAM (up from 8GB in the Pixel 8), and the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL said to have 16GB (up from 12GB in the Pixel 8 Pro).The Pixel 9 design leak that's most likely to be accurate though is one from a Taiwanese regulatory agency, which shared photos of every model. You can see some of these in the gallery below.Image 1 of 3The Pixel 9(Image credit: NCC)The Pixel 9 Pro(Image credit: NCC)The Pixel 9 Pro XL(Image credit: NCC)Meanwhile, we've also heard about the different colors that the Pixel 9 models might come in \\u2013 with some official wallpapers included in the same leak.These colors apparently include Jade, Obsidian, Peony, and Porcelain for the Pixel 9, Hazel, Obsidian, Porcelain, and Rose for the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL, and then Obsidian and Porcelain (or Gold) for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.Another Pixel 9 colors leak though points to in Obsidian, Porcelain, Mojito (probably a pale green), and Cosmo (which we\\u2019re not sure of) shades for the Pixel 9, Obsidian, Porcelain, Hazel, and Pink for the Pixel 9 Pro, Obsidian, Porcelain, and Hazel for the Pixel 9 Pro XL, and Obsidian and Porcelain for the Pixel 9 Pro Fold.One of the more recent leaks shows off the Pixel 9 in a bright pink color \\u2013 this video was apparently taken in Algeria, and matches up with earlier leaks we've seen around the handset.Pixel 9 is already out in Algeria.Storage: 256GBColor : PinkI'll keep you updated tomorrow morning. pic.twitter.com/0mE1QlCbEgJuly 1, 2024Google Pixel 9: potential cameras and batteryThe Pixel 8 Pro (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)There aren\\u2019t many Pixel 9 camera rumors so far, but leaked renders (shown in the previous section) show a triple-lens camera, complete with a square lens which would presumably be a periscope camera, for long-distance optical zoom. The Pixel 8 doesn't have a periscope/telephoto lens, so this would be quite an upgrade.Similarly, we've seen leaked renders of the Pixel 9 Pro with three rear cameras, though that would be the same number as the Pixel 8 Pro. This leak also suggests one of the lenses might offer a variable aperture, and shows a single-lens camera on the front.For reference, the Pixel 8 has a 50MP main camera, a 12MP ultra-wide, and a 10.5MP front-facing one, while the Pixel 8 Pro has a 50MP main camera, a 48MP ultra-wide, a 48MP periscope (with 5x optical zoom), and a 10.5MP selfie camera.It\\u2019s likely that some of these cameras will reappear in 2024\\u2019s phones, while others will probably be upgraded, either with more megapixels or simply a change in sensor. We doubt Google will add any additional cameras to the phones, but that\\u2019s speculation for now.Oh, and if there is a third model, that will presumably have the same cameras as the Pixel 9 Pro, if indeed it\\u2019s being positioned as a smaller Pro option.It\\u2019s also likely that we\\u2019ll see some new camera modes, as Google often adds to the camera software with new models.As for the battery, a Taiwanese regulatory agency has stated that the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro have 4,558mAh batteries, and the Pixel 9 Pro XL has a 4,942mAh one.These are likely minimum rather than rated capacities, but for reference the\\u00a0Pixel 8\\u00a0has a 4,485mAh rated capacity and a 4,575mAh typical one, and the\\u00a0Pixel 8 Pro\\u00a0has 4,950mAh rated capacity and a 5,050mAh typical one.The same source also suggested that the Pixel 9 will charge at 27W and the Pixel 9 Pro at 30W, just like their predecessors, while the Pixel 9 Pro XL might charge at 35W or more.Google Pixel 9: potential specs and featuresThe Pixel 8 (Image credit: Google)Rumored to use a new Tensor G4 chipsetUnclear how much more powerful it will beThe Google Pixel 9 and its siblings will all almost certainly use the Tensor G4 chipset, since the previous three models used the first three generations of the Tensor chip respectively. Indeed, the source that pointed to there being a third Pixel 9 model has specifically said this, and claimed the chipset is codenamed \\u2018redondo\\u2019.We\\u2019ve elsewhere heard that the Tensor G4 will apparently be a \\u201csmaller upgrade than initially planned\\u201d, so the Pixel 9 line might not have much of a performance boost. That\\u2019s a shame, especially when you consider that Google\\u2019s Tensor chipsets never match the top mobile chipsets from Qualcomm or Apple for power.Sadly, early Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL benchmarks support this claim, with disappointing scores, though the Pixel 9 Pro XL was at least listed as having a massive 16GB of RAM.On the other hand, another leak suggests the Tensor G4 will offer improved performance, power efficiency, heat management, and that that the Tensor G4's primary core could offer 15% better performance and 40% better power efficiency than the Tensor G3's primary core.The phone might also have an improved AI assistant, with one leak claiming the Pixel 9 line will have a new AI assistant called Pixie, which is described as more personalized and powerful than Google Assistant.Also on the AI front, there's evidence that Google is working on an AI-powered sticker creator, possibly called Creative Assistant, and this might launch with the Pixel 9.Another upgrade might come in the form of a new modem for the Pixel 9 line, which could both improve the reliability and stability of networks on the phone, and also add emergency satellite connectivity.Beyond that, we haven\\u2019t heard anything, but it\\u2019s very possible that Google will keep the temperature sensor that it added to the Pixel 8 Pro, and perhaps even bring it to more models.Google Pixel 9: what we want to seeBased on the Pixel 8 series specs, we already have a wishlist of what we want from the Pixel 9 line, with the following things being top of it.1. A refreshed designThe Google Pixel 8 (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)We\\u2019re big fans of the design Google introduced with the Pixel 6, but roughly the same design has been used for the Pixel 7 and now the Pixel 8, so we think it\\u2019s time to change things up with the Pixel 9.We\\u2019d love to see a similarly distinctive design, one that stands out from the crowd, but which also stands out from other Pixels. That might be a big ask, but Google managed this once, so we\\u2019re hopeful it can do it again. So far leaks suggest the design might be changing, but arguably not for the better.2. A 10x telephoto cameraThe Google Pixel 8 Pro can already optically zoom further than most phones, at 5x, but that\\u2019s no better than the Pixel 7 Pro, and still lags behind the Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra and its 10x optical zoom. It also has more competition from Apple now, as that company introduced a 5x optical zoom on the iPhone 15 Pro Max.So we\\u2019d like to see Google increase the zoom distance to 10x for the Pixel 9 Pro, to help ensure this is one of the best camera phones.3. A temperature sensor for all modelsThe Pixel 8 Pro (Image credit: Future / Lance Ulanoff)One of the more intriguing additions to the Pixel 8 line is a temperature sensor, but Google has made this exclusive to the Pixel 8 Pro.While that\\u2019s an understandable decision, it\\u2019s a feature that helps the Pixel 8 Pro stand out from other phones, and it\\u2019s a feature that could help the rest of the line do the same if it was offered on them. So we\\u2019d like to see it included on all Pixel 9 models, to give them an extra selling point.James RogersonSocial Links NavigationJames is a freelance phones, tablets and wearables writer and sub-editor at TechRadar.

How to choose13. How we testWe\\u2019re often asked about the best dash cams, but the reality is this: there's no dash cam that's right for every driver and vehicle. Sure, there are some things that every good dash cam should do well, like recording sharp video of the road ahead. But the relevance of other features will come down to your individual needs and budget. That\\u2019s why we\\u2019ve tested a wide variety of dash cams, from entry-level models to premium recording systems.Based on our in-depth reviews, we think the top choice for most people right now is the Nextbase iQ. It\\u2019s one of the smartest dash cams we\\u2019ve tested, with a full suite of assistance and security features \\u2013 and more on the way through firmware updates. That said, it\\u2019s also one of the most expensive dash cams in our list, so there's a good chance you might prefer a different option.Our expert team assesses every dash cam extensively, testing them in a range of real-world scenarios. These genuine reviews cover everything from setup and usability, to the reliability of assistance features and overall video quality. We highlight both the benefits and drawbacks of each option, to make it as easy as possible for you to pick the right dash cam.The quick listIf you want a shortcut to the best dash cams for every driver, our quick round-up below will give you an overview of the top options for every budget.

Available in 1K, 2K and 4K variants, it\\u2019s a premium solution with a suite of connected skills. That includes parking assistance, a voice-activated Witness Mode and the ability to check in on your vehicle via the Nextbase iQ app, as well as GPS, Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. All three versions include an interior camera, and there\\u2019s an optional rear-facing unit. You will need a paid subscription to get the full benefit of its abilities, which means the iQ can quickly become a costly bit of kit.But our tests found that it\\u2019s also an impressive one. Setup proved simple in our review, while the app made it easy to access its many features. Footage and audio from our 4K review unit was predictably excellent, too. Because powered is delivered directly from the car\\u2019s battery, the system remains active even when the engine\\u2019s off. It will be overkill for many road users, but if you want a complete, all-in-one camera to monitor your car at all times, the Nextbase iQ is as clever as they come.Read our in-depth Nextbase iQ review^ Back to the topThe best budget dash camImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Garmin)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)2.

You\\u2019ll need to spend more on a premium model for higher resolution video.The Garmin Mini 2 is tiny enough to disappear behind your car\\u2019s rear-view mirror. Despite its size, it records in Full HD at 30fps with HDR. In our review, it produced footage sharp enough to pick out key details like registration plates, regardless of the ambient light and weather conditions. We found installation quick and simple in our tests, too. The plastic arm takes up very little windscreen space, while the ball-and-socket joint makes it easy to reposition.\\u00a0The interface is similarly accessible: though there's no display, shortcut buttons let you save clips and mute the mic with one touch. We found that the Garmin Drive smartphone app (for iOS and Android) lets you easily change settings, review recordings and check the camera\\u2019s view. While features are limited to voice controls and a g-sensor that can detect collisions, we felt that GPS was the only real omission. Unless you need the best dash cam with driver assistance functions, the Garmin Dash Cam Mini 2 will leave you wanting for very little. Simple, subtle and reliable, it\\u2019s the definition of set-and-forget technology.Read our in-depth Garmin Dash Cam Mini 2 review^ Back to the topThe best all-rounder dash camImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Nextbase)(Image credit: Nextbase)(Image credit: Nextbase)(Image credit: Nextbase)(Image credit: Nextbase)3.

We found its 4K/30p footage almost cinematic in testing, with crisp definition and outstanding detail. Low-light algorithms also improve results in tricky conditions. Drop down to 1080p and we found that you can shoot 120fps slow-mo that makes it easier to pinpoint things like registration numbers.\\u00a0We were impressed with how effectively the built-in polarizing filter reduced windscreen glare, too, and how well the digital image stabilization soaked up road vibrations.\\u00a0Our tests did reveal that setup was slightly fiddly, and the 3-inch touchscreen requires obvious swipe inputs. We also had some trouble connecting to our smartphones to transfer video clips. That said, we still think the 622GW is a simple camera to use overall. We found its interface intuitive, while the display is big, sharp and clear. Footage is automatically saved when an incident is detected, and thanks to clever what3words integration, the 622GW can pinpoint the location of stricken vehicles and send it on to emergency vehicles. The Nextbase iQ (above) is even smarter still, but if you want a capable dash cam that reliably captures clear 4K video, the 622GW is well worth considering.Read our in-depth Nextbase 622GW review^ Back to the topThe best dash cam for high-mileage driversImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Nexar)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)4.

Comprised of two separate camera units connected by a cable, we found the setup to be pretty neat, even if it took up a fair bit of screen real estate. It doesn't record in 4K, but from our tests we found its 1080p video perfectly serviceable. The external camera fared well even in tricky shooting situations, from heavy rain to bright sunshine.We found that the Nexar app is central to the twin-camera experience: it\\u2019s where you can fine-tune settings, generate incident reports and back recorded clips up to the cloud (Nexar bundles cloud storage in for free). Other useful tools include break-in alerts if someone tries to tamper with your car, as well as GPS data logging. There are cheaper dash cams out there with fewer features to play with, but if the security of your car is crucial to your daily life, the Pro is hard to beat in terms of protection and overall value.Read our in-depth Nexar Pro review^ Back to the topThe best low-profile 4K dash camImage 1 of 5(Image credit: TechRadar)(Image credit: TechRadar)(Image credit: TechRadar)(Image credit: TechRadar)(Image credit: TechRadar)5.

It can also record Full HD footage at a smoother 60fps, for enhanced detail while you drive. Results in our review proved sharp night and day, with accurate colors and acceptable noise in low light. Our testing also revealed that the optional polarising filter usefully reduces dashboard reflections, while the 160-degree angle captures a wide view of what's ahead.We found that the E1\\u2019s magnetic mount works well, but the lack of sideways adjustment does limit its use if you can\\u2019t fit it centrally. A tiny 1.54-inch screen offers a preview when installing, but the smartphone app is the more useful way to tweak settings. You don\\u2019t get the driver assistance systems of other dash cams, so it\\u2019s up to you or your vehicle to spot speed cameras and potential collisions. That said, you still get Wi-Fi and GPS connectivity, and we like that Vantrue has focused on video quality over unnecessary extras.Read our in-depth Vantrue E1 review^ Back to the topThe best for ease of useImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)6.

Our tests found a lot to like about the X1000. Installation does require the use of several sticky pads and we felt that the user guide could have been more comprehensive in helping to navigate setup. You\\u2019ll also need to hard-wire it to unlock the full set of features, including parking surveillance, while GPS and radar detection require optional accessories.\\u00a0Still, once in place, the unit feels nicely put together. Its best attribute is its ease of use: with a large 3.5-inch touchscreen and icon-based interface, it\\u2019s simple to configure and there\\u2019s no need to rely on a smartphone partner app. Capture settings can be tweaked via the touchscreen, but we found that it worked well right out of the box. Results from both cameras were impressive, with plenty of crisp detail and decent dynamic range, even in dim and dark conditions. If you\\u2019re looking for a stress-free and reliable dash cam, the X1000 gets plenty right.Read our in-depth Thinkware X1000 review^ Back to the topThe best value dual dash camImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)7.

The front camera is a proven performer, capturing sharp detail both night and day during our tests. Its design remains as slim and modern as with the single-cam option, although we wish it used a suction cup instead of sticky adhesive. Joining it is a tiny rear camera that records 2K video at 30fps. Like the forward unit, it covers a 140-degree field of view. That\\u2019s enough for the view front and rear, but rivals offer wider angles.\\u00a0With a generous 128GB of internal storage, you get twice as much capacity as the previous Miofive 4K, with space for around 8 hours of record time before loop recording will start to overwrite the oldest clips. We were impressed by the slick Miofive app, as well as the camera\\u2019s generous feature set: you get built-in GPS, collision warnings and super capacitor power. Even with these capabilities, setup remains straightforward, although you might need to be creative about hiding the longer, thicker rear camera cable. Overall, if you need dual-cam coverage, we think there\\u2019s plenty of value here.Read our in-depth Miofive Dual Dash Cam^ Back to the topBest for ride-share driversImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: TechRadar)(Image credit: TechRadar)(Image credit: TechRadar)(Image credit: TechRadar)8.

Designed with taxi drivers in mind, it forgoes many of the extras which your car is already likely to have, including speed camera alerts and collision warnings.\\u00a0That simplicity extends to its connectivity, a factor we liked in testing. With no Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or smartphone app, it\\u2019s a self-contained dash cam that gets on with the job of capturing events. The only feature we did miss was GPS tracking, although Vantrue sells an optional GPS windscreen mount.We were happily surprised by the video quality our review. The cameras can record Full HD footage in both directions, capturing video that\\u2019s smooth, sharp and clear, matched by decent audio. The interior camera occasionally struggles in bright sunlight, but that\\u2019s a small criticism of otherwise impressive performance. The front camera can also go solo to shoot in even more detailed 1440p.Read our in-depth Vantrue N2 Pro review^ Back to the topBest 360 degreeImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)9. 70mai Dash Cam Omni    Best omni-directional front dash camOur expert review:    SpecificationsVideo quality: 1080p up to 60fpsViewing angle: 140 degrees, omnidiectionalGPS tracker: YesMemory: eMMC built-in 32GB / 64GB or 128GBToday's Best DealsView at Amazon(128GB)Reasons to buy+Omni-directional+User-friendly voice controlsReasons to avoid-No default cloud backup-Parking surveillance requires hardwiring70mai Omni sample footageBuy it if:\\u2705 You'd like 360-degree coverage: The Omni can rotate through to cover a full 360 degrees and film from any angle.\\u2705 You enjoy a user-friendly experience: The Omni has charming 'human-like' display graphics.Don't buy it if:\\u274c You need 4K video quality: Topping out at 1920x1080 Full HD video up to 60fps, the Omni's video resolution is bettered elsewhere.\\u274c Auto syncing your footage to the cloud is helpful: You can sync your footage to the cloud, but only via an optional 4G hardware kit.There's no dash cam quite like the 70mai Omni. It's a single camera with a 140-degree field of view and a trick up its sleeve: it can rotate to provide full 360-degree coverage from its position on the windshield. That means you can record your journeys out the front like any other dash cam, or turn it to film inside the cabin of your vehicle. Video resolution tops out at 1080p up to 60fps, so footage isn't the most detailed, but we were impressed by the low-light performance of the f/1.8 lens in testing.In our review, we found the Omni well-designed with a user-friendly experience, complete with fun graphics and animations on the display when you interact with it.\\u00a0It also benefits from AI-powered surveillance features to keep your vehicle safe, such as motion detection and threat-level processing. As far as single dash cams go, this is one of the most fun to use, plus the list price is reasonable \\u2013 though you'll need to buy the 4G hardware kit if you want to backup to the cloud automatically.Read our in-depth 70mai Dash Cam Omni review^ Back to the topBest for older cars without an infotainment systemImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Alistair Charlton)(Image credit: Alistair Charlton)(Image credit: Alistair Charlton)(Image credit: Alistair Charlton)(Image credit: Alistair Charlton)10.

If you won\\u2019t use all of its features, you\\u2019ll find better value in standalone cameras.Combining a dash cam and a sat nav, the Garmin DriveCam 76 is a feature-packed tool for vehicles without an infotainment system. In testing, we found its 7-inch display intuitive to use. It makes Garmin\\u2019s rich mapping visuals easy to follow, while navigation is clear and well-timed, complemented by live traffic updates when paired with your smartphone\\u2019s data connection. The unit itself is much larger than many rivals, though, which can make it tricky to place without obstructing the driver\\u2019s view. Helpfully, both the display angle and camera lens are adjustable, so you can find the right position between road and driver.\\u00a0Full HD footage is shot in HDR at 30fps, delivering balanced exposure and enough detail to make number plates legible. That said, we found that video suffers from noticeable stabilization wobble. This distortion doesn\\u2019t reduce the detail, but footage is worse than from other Garmin dash cams. You\\u2019ll also find better value dash cams if you don\\u2019t need features such as smartphone notifications and weather updates. But if you want a dash cam with added smarts, this is a great choice.\\u00a0Read our in-depth Garmin DriveCam 76 review^ Back to the topHow to choose the best dash cam for youHow to choose the best dash cam for youThe best dash cams can have anything from one, two or even three cameras. Single camera dash cams record the outside view from your windscreen, dual dash cams add an inside facing camera which is especially useful for ride-share drivers like taxis, while three-camera dash cams are more for professional drivers clocking up the miles, adding an additional viewpoint from the outside of the vehicle, being especially handy for trucks.Video resolution is a key consideration when choosing a dash cam, as explained below. Most dash cams in 2024 can record footage in Full HD, which is generally enough to identify large details in a video clip. Sharper 4K dash cams tend to cost more, but capture video at a higher resolution. This makes it easier to pull out crucial details such as number plates, which mean 4K dash cams generally offer more reassurance from a safety perspective.Video frame rates are also important. Most dash cams can record at 30fps, which is fine for reviewing footage at full speed, but the best models can capture action at a smoother 60fps. This gives you the option to slow down footage after the fact, making it easier to pick up details at half-speed. It\\u2019s increasingly common to find dash cams that can capture Full HD video at 60fps, but 4K 60fps recording is generally reserved for professional dash cams. Certain models, such as the Nextbase 622GW, also feature digital image stabilization, which helps to smooth out footage on bumpy roads.There are also a wealth of features to consider, including a touchscreen display, a companion app, GPS, parking surveillance, voice control, sat nav and what3words to name but a few. \\u00a0If you drive an older car without an infotainment system, then it\\u2019s worth getting a dash cam with sat nav, but there\\u2019s little point if your car already has sat nav. GPS location data is handy when recording incidents, while some even include what3words geolocation data which offers the most precise way of pinpointing your vehicle and super handy should you become stricken.\\u00a0(Image credit: Future)Getting started with a dash camThe overall experience installing, getting started and ease of use on the go varies wildly from dash cam to dash cam. For the most part, dash cams mount somewhere along a car's front windscreen or windshield. Of course, wherever you place your dash cam must not block your view of the road.The advent of rear-facing cameras (or complete kits that contain both front and rear) require a little extra installation, as these often involve cables that run from front to back. Expect some fiddly work involving the car's headliner to get these fitted correctly.\\u00a0Dash cams record smaller snippets of footage, usually in increments of one to two minutes at a time. The cameras continually record over the oldest clip in order to keep the memory card from filling up as well.While older models typically required the user to manually save or tag the appropriate clip in the event of an accident, new G-Sensor-based incident detection technology has taken over, and now takes care of this automatically.There are also dash cams that boast additional features that, just like any other technology, translate to a higher asking price. In addition to better video quality like 4K, night vision and built-in Wi-Fi or Bluetooth for easy file transfer may also be included.A rise in popularity of voice control has also made its way over to the humble dash cam, so expect Alexa integration and other such voice-activated technology at the very pinnacle of the range.Numerous parking modes are also possibilities. These use a time-lapse feature as a surveillance function to capture details of those irksome car park prangs when you're off running errands.(Image credit: Future)Is it worth having a dash cam?Yes, absolutely. Some drivers might not like the idea of a camera constantly monitoring their vehicle, but some models of dash cam (like the Garmin Dash Cam Mini 2) are compact and subtle enough to almost disappear behind the central rear view mirror. In other words, once they are up and running you soon forget about them; they just sit there, quietly keeping an eye out, ready to save footage if you\\u2019re caught in an accident.If the worst were to happen, and you need to prove your innocence, the dash cam\\u2019s footage could do exactly that. This footage can also be set to include your speed, along with the time and date to help reinforce the validity of your evidence if blame is disputed by the other party. As well as monitoring the road ahead, dash cams can be used to record out of the rear windscreen too, recording footage if you are unfortunate enough to be rear-ended by another motorist.Even if you're not directly involved in a collision, dash cams can still be useful. Many have a button for quickly saving the last few seconds of video. That way, if you need something ahead that you think needs recording, like an accident between two other vehicles, an example of bad driving, or something else noteworthy, you can provide that evidence to whoever might need it. Another useful feature of some dash cams is how they will call the emergency services if a crash is detected and you don\\u2019t respond; they can then share your location and ensure help is on its way.Furthermore, many dash cams come with additional driver assistance features. These include alerts to let you know about nearby speed cameras and red light cameras, plus a prompt to tell you the vehicle in front has set off \\u2013 just in case you weren\\u2019t paying attention while sat in traffic.Lastly, some dash cams can be permanently installed in your vehicle and hard-wired, giving them a constant power supply. When paired with a special parking mode, this enables the camera to sense impacts and record footage while the car is parked, potentially gathering useful evidence of your neighbor\\u2019s poor parking.(Image credit: Nexar)Can a dash cam drain your car battery?Different dash cams use different power sources, so it's always worth checking how your new dash cam is powered if you're concerned about draining your car's battery.Some dash cams have internal power, or can easily be charged using external power sources. However, the rest use the cigarette lighter/USB port in your vehicle or need to be hard-wired, meaning they do use your car's battery.If you use the cigarette lighter/USB port to power your dash cam, then leaving it plugged in overnight might drain your car battery, depending on if your vehicle supplies constant power to the ports. Hard-wired dash cams can be set up to switch on with the car ignition in some vehicles to save battery, too.\\u00a0If you were planning on using your new dash cam for security purposes, you might want to consider choosing a dash cam with motion detection and using an external power source to make sure you don't drain your car battery.(Image credit: Nextbase)Is a GoPro better than a dash cam?GoPro cameras are some of the best action cameras you can buy. They can be easily mounted to your dashboard and set to record video on a rolling loop. Because GoPro cameras are compact, they shouldn\\u2019t obstruct your view of the road ahead, while the latest models are capable of capturing videos at resolutions sharper than 4K.However, there are certain factors which make a dedicated dash cam better than a GoPro for recording the road. The price difference between a GoPro Hero 11 Black and a premium dash cam such as the Nextbase 622GW is less than you might think. But what you don\\u2019t get with a GoPro camera are the more advanced features associated with a high-spec dash cam, such as collision detection or parking protection. You\\u2019ll also need to manually set a GoPro to record every time you get behind the wheel, even if its power cable is connected to your vehicle.So if you already own a GoPro, pairing it with a dashboard mount or windshield suction cup is an easy way to record video while you\\u2019re driving. We even have a dedicated guide on how to use a GoPro as a dash cam for your car. However, if you\\u2019re looking for a comprehensive solution to capture in-car video, it\\u2019s worth considering a dash cam.(Image credit: Future)Are dash cams legal?Using a dash cam is generally legal in both the UK and the US. In fact, certain bodies in both countries actively encourage the use of dash cams to reduce insurance premiums. That said, there are a few basic rules to follow to ensure your dash cam usage stays on the right side of the law.A dash cam shouldn\\u2019t obstruct your view of the road ahead or distract you while you\\u2019re behind the wheel. For this reason, some people prefer to choose a model without a display. In the US, many states have regulations governing where you can mount a dash cam. Several prohibit you from fitting one to your windshield, for example.Privacy regulations are another factor to consider. As there is no reasonable expectation of privacy on public roads, it\\u2019s generally legal to record with a dash cam while driving. However, this changes on private property, such as a person\\u2019s driveway. While dash cam recordings can usually be justified on the grounds of safety and security, it\\u2019s important to act reasonably and be mindful of where and what you record.This is particularly the case for professional drivers. If you\\u2019re a taxi driver, for example, you should inform passengers that your vehicle is fitted with a dash cam, particularly if it\\u2019s recording audio. In the US, several states only permit sound recording with the permission of everyone in the vehicle.You should also think carefully before sharing any dash cam footage online. Uploading videos that identify individuals without their consent could breach data protection laws. It\\u2019s always safer to blur details such as registration plates and faces when publishing any dash cam clips.It\\u2019s worth nothing that a number of European countries restrict the use of dash cams, so be sure to familiarize yourself with regional rules.\\u00a0(Image credit: Nextbase)What is loop recording?Loop recording allows dash cams to continuously record video footage to their built-in storage or memory card. The setting automatically overwrites the oldest clips on your camera with new ones when its storage becomes full. This way, it can keep recording without requiring you to pull over and manually delete unneeded clips. This gives you the reassurance that there will be no gap in your driving log.By default, dash cams save video clips in sequential order. Loop recording usually works by splitting these clips into preset intervals based on file size or time, such as 2-minute or 5-minute segments. By dividing recordings like this, dash cams can write over small parts of a longer video without erasing the entire thing at once. This can also make it easier to locate clips of specific moments, without having to scan through lengthy recordings.To stop important clips from being overwritten, many of the best dash cams can automatically detect potential incidents and flag the relevant footage to protect it from deletion. Most models with loop recording also allow you to manually tag clips with the same effect, generally by way of a shortcut button on the body of the dash cam.How we test dash camsHow we test dash cams(Image credit: Future)Why you can trust TechRadar\\u2611\\ufe0f 10s of dash cams reviewed\\u2611\\ufe0f 15 years of product testing\\u2611\\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\\u2611\\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing techAlmost all dash cams can be fitted to a car without making any permanent modification. They can be attached to a windscreen using a suction cup or removable adhesive pad, and powered from either a USB port or the 12V socket found in almost all cars. To test dash cams, we install them in our car, attach them to the windscreen and pair them to our smartphone as if we had bought them ourselves.We then drive, at day and night, to test how the camera handles different lighting conditions, and ideally in varied weather too. The footage is then transferred to a smartphone or computer and viewed to check out the quality, and whether key details like vehicle registration plates are legible. This also gives us an opportunity to see how easy (or difficult) it is to view, transfer and save recorded footage.(Image credit: Let Geo Create / Shutterstock)Additional features like voice assistants and drive assistance systems get a thorough workout, and we also test how easy it is to turn these off, or adjust them to our personal preferences. Being able to quickly and easily turn audio recording off is key, especially when carrying passengers who don\\u2019t want their conversations recorded.Naturally, we cannot crash a vehicle to see how well the dash cam detects collisions. Instead, firmly tapping the dash cam can simulate a collision, allowing us to see what happens when footage is saved. It is also possible to trigger a recording by powering the camera with a portable battery and tapping it against our desk. It may seem rudimentary, but it works and keeps our insurance company happy.Sometimes, driving over a particularly aggressive speed bump can trigger a dash cam recording. In these cases we learn that the camera\\u2019s g-sensor is too sensitive, and needs to be adjusted, providing the menu system includes such an option.\\u00a0Round up of today's best dealsNextbase iQ $499.99 $399.99ViewSee all pricesGarmin Dash Cam Mini 2 $107.90ViewSee all pricesNextbase 622GW $395.99 $299.99ViewSee all pricesNexar Pro GPS $184.95 $139.95ViewSee all pricesVantrue E1 $149.99ViewSee all pricesThinkware X1000 $299.99 $219.99ViewSee all pricesMiofive Dual dash cam $249.99 $229.99ViewSee all pricesVantrue N2 Pro dash cam $199.99 $169.99ViewSee all prices70mai Dash Cam Omni $199.99ViewSee all pricesGarmin DriveCam 76 $429.08ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Timothy ColemanSocial Links NavigationCameras editorTim is the Cameras editor at TechRadar.

Look at our list below and you\\u2019ll find huge variety: from pocket-friendly gimbal cams to premium mirrorless hybrids. We\\u2019ve tested each one extensively and they all rate highly, in their own way, as vlogging cameras.\\u00a0Based on hours of testing, we think the best camera for most vloggers in 2024 is the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. It\\u2019s genuinely pocket-friendly and uses a 3-axis stabilizing gimbal to shoot smooth 4K content. Auto-tracking smarts make it easy to vlog solo, while pairing it with the DJI Mic 2 results in quality audio. It\\u2019s so good, we use it to shoot TechRadar\\u2019s TikTok content. That said, we know it might not be the right choice for your vlogging plans.The idea behind our round-up is to make it easy for you to find your ideal vlogging camera, whatever your budget. To that end, our experienced team has extensively tested a whole range of vlogging options out in the real world. We assess factors such as image stabilization, handling, autofocus and connectivity, as well as overall video quality. You\\u2019ll find our honest feedback broken down for each entry, as well as the niche we think it fits best.Written byWritten byTimothy ColemanCameras EditorTim is TechRadar's Cameras Editor.

Not only do you get a pocket-friendly form factor and silky smooth footage thanks to a three-axis gimbal, but its video quality is capable of keeping up with larger devices like the Sony ZV-1.\\u00a0New features like a 1-inch sensor and 2-inch rear LCD cement its place as the best vlogging camera for most people. The former not only improves the Pocket 3\\u2019s low-light capabilities and resolution, but also crucially ramps up support for multi-aspect video.The DJI Osmo Pocket 3 will give you a substantial upgrade versus a smartphone when it comes to vlogging. You get support for 4K 120p (fantastic for slo-mo footage), while its pocket-friendly size and gimbal make it much more convenient than an interchangeable lens camera. It supports remote mics too, although the onboard mic is more than enough for decent audio quality. Thanks to a rotating touchscreen rear display, switching between a vertical aspect ratio or traditional horizontal 16:9 is seamless \\u2013 and the resulting footage is fantastic, as you\\u2019re not losing out on any detail.\\u00a0Read our in-depth DJI Pocket 3 review^ Back to the topThe best compact vlogging cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)2.

Its compact packaging gives it excellent versatility, as do its hotshoe, mic port, and fully articulating touchscreen. In field testing, we found its real-time tracking and Eye AF to be best-in-class and the 1-inch sensor was capable of producing crisp, detailed 4K/30p video. Our review also confirmed that the ZV-1 offers a huge amount of depth for a compact camera, with handy features like a built-in ND filter and S-Log2 profiles for those who want to embrace color grading.\\u00a0While the newer Sony ZV-1F offers a wider 20mm lens and smartphone-style interface for a lower price, its older contrast AF system and coldshoe mount mean it can\\u2019t oust the original from the top spot. Nor can the Sony ZV-1 II, the pricier successor to the ZV-1 that features a wider lens but no in-body stabilization. These are great cameras, but their feature sets don't merit the extra cost - especially when Sony is continuing the sell the the ZV-1.Read our in-depth Sony ZV-1 review^ Back to the topThe best premium vlogging cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)3.

In our review, we found that the GH6 tops it in almost every way. Equipped with a sharper 25.2MP Micro Four Thirds sensor, it shoots 5.7K footage at 60fps and offers a massive arsenal of formats, frame rates, and resolutions \\u2013 including a larger catalog of 10-bit modes. Forced-fan cooling means limitless recording times, while connectivity options are also comprehensive. The only thing it lacks is the live-streaming capabilities of the GH5 Mark II.While it\\u2019s marginally larger than the GH5 Mark II, it's still pretty portable. A robust build is complemented by familiar controls and new tally lights front and back. The 3-inch rear touchscreen flips, twists and tilts, while a second video record button on the front makes it easier for vloggers to start rolling. There\\u2019s still no phase detection AF, although contrast-based autofocus performance does seem improved from the GH5 Mark II. We found stabilization superb too, courtesy of an algorithmic upgrade that makes the GH6 one of the best cameras for smoothing out walking motion in a natural way.Read our in-depth Panasonic Lumix GH6 review^ Back to the topThe best hybrid vlogging cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)4.

Inheriting the well-balanced body of the X-S10 means the X-S20 sits very comfortably in the hand, while our first impressions in testing found that simplified dials on the top plate make it easier to get to grips with what is quite an advanced shooting tool. It also inherits the same 26.1MP X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor as the X-S10 and X-T4, which we already know from our previous tests is a top performer.\\u00a0The X-S20 boosts things further by offering 6K/30p 4:2:2 10-bit internal recording, which is close to overkill. Improved in-body image stabilization also worked well in testing. With a bigger battery on-board, we think this all adds up to a great mirrorless all-rounder. Its price hike will be a drawback for many beginners, while the lack of weather sealing is a broader disappointment. The older X-S10 is still available at a lower price, but features such as a dedicated Vlog mode \\u2013 which puts neat creative settings a tap away \\u2013 make the X-S20 the more tempting proposition for vloggers.Read our in-depth Fujifilm X-S20 review^ Back to the topThe best full-frame vlogging cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)5.

As the smallest, lightest full-frame camera with image stabilization, we found it a winner for solo vlogging. The ZV-E10 is even more portable, but you won\\u2019t get the same video quality from its smaller APS-C sensor. It\\u2019s not perfect for heavy use, with no cooling vents and just one card slot. We also found it tricky to pick out details on the touchscreen when working outdoors. But if you\\u2019re a content creator shooting alone, we still think the ZV-E1 is the ultimate full-frame choice for 4K vlogging.Our tests found it capable of capturing crisp 4K 60p footage in all lighting conditions, thanks to a full-frame sensor borrowed from the revered A7S III. We were also impressed by its in-body image stabilization, which produced superbly smooth handheld footage that almost makes a gimbal unnecessary. Cutting-edge AI smarts also leave very little to fix after the fact: Auto Framing reliably tracks subjects across the image, which we think is a big win when you\\u2019re recording alone.Read our in-depth Sony ZV-E1 review^ Back to the topThe best beginner vlogging cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)6.

With no viewfinder, it goes all in on a vari-angle touchscreen. Despite its tidy proportions, our tests found that a generous grip made the Z30 comfortable to handle, even when self-shooting. The 3.0-inch display was also intuitive to use. Flip it for vlogging and the camera switches to selfie mode, reliably tracking your face with sticky autofocus. What you can\\u2019t do in selfie mode is visually check sound levels. With no headphone jack, this leaves audio monitoring to guesswork.Nikon\\u2019s APS-C lens range remains limited, but the 16-50mm kit glass is impressively sharp. And because the Z30 records using the whole width of the sensor, you can utilise the lens\\u2019 full field of view. Electronic vibration reduction also stabilizes handheld vlogging, although its 1.3x crop is restrictive at arm\\u2019s length. But with EV-R disabled, the Z30 can shoot uncropped 4K/30p and HD 120p video. Together with a range of color profiles and neat touches like a tally lamp, the Z30 shapes up as a competent offering for fledgling creators.Read our in-depth Nikon Z30 review^ Back to the topThe best mid-range vlogging cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)7.

It\\u2019s lighter than the Panasonic GH5 (above), yet still feels solid in the hand. A tally light would be handy when working solo, but we otherwise found its controls intuitive in testing, with an articulating display that\\u2019s crisp and useful for framing. Panasonic has finally embraced phase detection AF for video on the S5 II. Paired with effective image stabilization, the result is dreamy smooth video even when shooting handheld.In our review, we found that the S5 II excels when shooting video. It produced excellent 6K/30p footage, with rich colors and wide dynamic range. Helpfully, it can record uncropped video using the full 3:2 aspect ratio of the sensor, which means you can easily crop content for different social platforms. Depending on your lens choice, some vloggers will find the 1.5x crop on 4K/60p video limiting, while you\\u2019ll need the premium S5 IIX for features like wireless IP streaming. Still, we think the S5 II is a compelling hybrid package for vloggers, especially with the excellent 20-60mm kit lens.Read our in-depth Panasonic S5 II review^ Back to the topThe best purpose-built vlogging cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)8.

It uses the same 1-inch sensor as the Powershot G7 X III from 2019, but optimised to work with a fixed 18mm F2.8 lens to rival the Sony ZV-1F. While dated in some ways, it has a natural advantage over most smartphones, producing sharp, detailed results in bright conditions, aided by subject-tracking that proved reliably sticky in testing. Digital image stabilization is a little jittery when smoothing footsteps, but this will likely improve with future firmware updates.We found its form factor curious in our review: there's room for improvement, but it handles well on the whole. Though it would benefit from better front-on visibility, the 2-inch flip-up touchscreen is useful for framing, while the simple control setup \\u2013 including a big record button \\u2013 proved pretty foolproof. We also found that its built-in stand makes life easier when working solo. Straightforward wireless live-streaming also enhances the camera\\u2019s vlogging chops. So while it can\\u2019t compete with the latest alternatives, the Powershot V10 makes sense as a pared-back choice for vloggers who want point-and-shoot simplicity.Read our in-depth Canon Powershot V10Find savings on Canon cameras with our Canon voucher codes.^ Back to the topAlso consider...The best action camera for vloggingImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Basil Kronfli)(Image credit: Basil Kronfli)(Image credit: Basil Kronfli)(Image credit: Basil Kronfli)(Image credit: Basil Kronfli)9.

It builds on the already impressive Hero 11 Black, introducing some pro-focused features that includes Bluetooth support, dual channel audio, better battery life, a tripod thread, plus the full 8:7 sensor area is now available for all video modes, with GoPro's log profile and HDR video. You also get the same 5.3K video at up to 60fps, with Horizon Lock and HyperSmooth 5.0, which do a remarkable job of keeping videos perfectly level when vlogging handheld. All of this together lets you create content that you couldn\\u2019t replicate with a smartphone.Both models are physically the same \\u2013 barring the Hero 12 Black's addition of a tripod thread \\u2013 and use the same battery, even though the new model's battery life is much better. The sensor is the same, too, so low-light performance underwhelms when compared to the DJI Osmo Action 4. And if you don't need its more serious video features, then the Hero 11 Black could be a more sensible option given it costs less. However, as our review notes, the Hero 12 Black is an action camera \\\"edging closer to perfection\\\".Read our in-depth GoPro Hero 12 Black review^ Back to the topThe best miniature vlogging cameraImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)10.

Hitting the scales at a mere 26.5g, the camera itself is a tiny, pared-back pebble that\\u2019s capable of capturing detailed and dynamic 1440p footage at up to 50fps. In our review, we found its stabilization isn\\u2019t up to GoPro standards, but the FlowState software does a reasonable job of mitigating walking motion, especially if you process video with your laptop rather than the Insta360 app. There\\u2019s no display on the camera itself, which will be a dealbreaker for some, but the app can be used for a wireless video preview.\\u00a0We did find the protective charging case very useful in testing: home to two buttons and an OLED readout, the controls and camera face the user when the Insta360 Go 2 is docked, making it an ideal handheld vlogging setup. The case also features fold-out legs for tripod duties and works as a remote for wireless camera control. At 30 minutes, battery life isn\\u2019t the best, but with a single microphone that renders vocals with decent punch and clarity, the Insta360 Go 2 is an easy, properly pocketable option for recording quick clips and vlogs on the go.Read our in-depth Insta360 Go 2 review^ Back to the topThe best smartphone gimbal for vloggingImage 1 of 5(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)(Image credit: Future)11.

With a smaller battery than previous editions, the latest model also sacrifices power bank functionality in favor of a more refined, compact design.\\u00a0In testing, we thought the OM 5 felt more elegant and premium than previous editions. We also felt that the option to extend it into a selfie stick added useful creative scope, even if it proved a little fiddly \\u2013 and offered a less versatile roll range than the OM 4 before it. We found that the 3-axis gimbal still did a great job of keeping footage smooth and steady. Improved active tracking and ShotGuides in the Memo app were also a hit in testing.

Not just for its novel 360-degree features and best-ever 8K video with superb image stablization, but also for its versatility \\u2013 in its single-lens mode you can shoot 4K 60p video, which considering its fully waterproof makes the X4 a legitimate action camera. You can go places and do things with the X4 for your vlogs that you simply can't do with other vlogging cameras, like the DJI Pocket 3, which isn't built to withstand tough weather or take a dip in the ocean.We had so much fun trying out the bullet time, hyperlapse and timelapse modes, while the increased 8K resolution sensor improves just about every shooting mode. For example, FreeFrame can shoot single-lens videos in multiple aspect ratios \\u2013 you pick if you want vertical or horizontal, ideal for getting your content out in multiple versions for different platforms. It may be a 360-degree camera, but the Insta360 X is the swiss army knife in the video world, and one of its tool is defintely vlogging. \\u00a0\\u00a0Read our in-depth Insta360 X4 hands-on review^ Back to the topHow to choose the best vlogging cameraFrom premium webcams to mirrorless models, the best vlogging cameras come in a range of shapes and sizes. The features you need will vary depending on what and how you like to shoot.If you\\u2019re a solo filmmaker, for example, you\\u2019ll probably want a camera with an articulating touchscreen which makes it much easier to frame shots when working by yourself. Equally, if a lot of your content involves speaking to the camera, you\\u2019ll need an external microphone input to ensure you capture top-notch audio for your audience. Reliable face-tracking autofocus will also mean that your subject stays sharp, even if they move within the frame.A lot of vloggers like to walk and talk at the same time. If this is your style, you should consider a camera with in-body image stabilization. This will help to smooth out any shaky motion caused by your footsteps and make footage much more watchable. Some cameras go a step further with an integrated gimbal which counteracts motion on several axes to stay level, like the DJI Pocket 2.Almost all of the best vlogging cameras can now shoot in 4K resolution as standard. But it\\u2019s important to look beyond resolution alone. High frame rates of 120fps and above will allow you to shoot stunning slow-motion footage, for example. And if post-processing is part of your workflow, 10-bit color depth will give you greater flexibility in the editing room.(Image credit: Future)What kind of camera do vloggers use?As you can tell from the buying advice above, vloggers use a wide range of different cameras depending on their specific needs.\\u00a0Many vloggers favor mirrorless models for their combination of image quality, performance and flexibility. The best mirrorless vlogging cameras feature high-resolution sensors, in-body image stabilization for smoother footage, plus the option to swap lenses to suit different shooting scenarios \\u2013 all in packages that are relatively portable. Mirrorless cameras are also more likely to feature ports for connecting external accessories, such as microphones, headphones and hot-shoe lights.That said, some vloggers prefer to prioritize portability. Truly tiny cameras like the Insta360 Go 2 sacrifice total creative control in favor of quick, simple accessibility for capturing off-the-cuff footage. Compact cameras like the Sony ZV-1 can represent a good middle ground for a lot of vloggers, offering solid image quality and manual control options, yet still in a form factor that can comfortably slip into a pocket.Other vloggers choose cameras which are specifically suited to their shooting needs. Rugged models like the GoPro Hero 10 Black, for example, offer advanced connectivity and live-streaming options, plus plenty of creative modes, in a sturdy package that makes it easy to shoot vlogs even in extreme weather conditions.Vloggers who stream from a seated position will often favor a premium webcam like the Razer Kiyo Pro, which deftly fills a unique niche. Equally, those who want a dedicated tool to record while they walk-and-talk might use something like DJI\\u2019s Pocket 2.(Image credit: Future)How we test vlogging camerasHow we test vlogging cameras(Image credit: Future)Why you can trust TechRadar\\u2611\\ufe0f 100s of cameras reviewed\\u2611\\ufe0f 15 years of product testing\\u2611\\ufe0f Over 16,000 products reviewed in total\\u2611\\ufe0f Nearly 200,000 hours testing techThe most important features for a vlogging camera are its video quality, autofocus, in-body image stabilization and audio options, so those are the main areas our tests focus on.\\u00a0To review the video quality, we shoot at the camera's highest resolution and frame-rate in a variety of handheld scenes, including the popular walk-and-talk style, to see how it handles colors, skin tones, detail and rolling shutter. We also include high-contrast scenes to test how well the auto-exposure and white balance adapt to changes in lighting.(Image credit: Future)These tests are also a good opportunity to the test the vlogging camera's Face and Eye tracking autofocus, along with the quality of its stabilization (both electronic and mechanical, if available). Another thing we test in these scenes is an oft-overlooked part of the vlogging equation, the built-in microphones. If the camera has a microphone input, we'll also use it with an external lav mic to see how the quality compares to its internal audio.Many of the latest vlogging cameras include additional features like flat color profiles, articulating touchscreens, built-in ND filters and, in Sony's case, a 'product showcase' feature that's ideal for those who run a YouTube channel from home. If available, we test all of these functions to see how they fare compared to their closest rivals, then wrap up our conclusions based on our various impressions of the camera's build quality, design, video quality, audio quality and features.Round up of today's best dealsDJI OSMO Pocket 3 $519ViewSee all pricesSony ZV-1 $748 $648ViewSee all pricesPanasonic GH6 $2,197.99ViewSee all pricesFujifilm X-S20 $1,299ViewSee all pricesSony ZV-E1 $2,199.99 $1,898ViewSee all pricesDeal ends Mon, Jul 22, 2024Nikon Z 30 $606.95ViewSee all pricesPanasonic Lumix S5II $1,697.99ViewSee all pricesCanon PowerShot V10 $429 $349ViewSee all pricesGoPro Hero12 Black $399.99 $299ViewSee all pricesDeal ends Mon, Jul 22, 2024Insta360 Go 2 $299ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.Timothy ColemanSocial Links NavigationCameras editorTim is the Cameras editor at TechRadar.
