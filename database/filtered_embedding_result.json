Not only that, each of the 50 YouTubers received a retro gaming handheld to call their own.The discovery was made on r/SBCGaming, where a screenshot of LilyPichu\u2019s vlog of her experience being in the MrBeast competition surfaced. Each participant was given a goody bag, which features custom AirPods, and something a little more unusual: An Anbernic RG353V handheld.Article continues after adArticle continues after adThe Anbernic RG353V isn\u2019t one of the priciest retro handhelds out there. In fact, the device with its 3.4-inch IPS display, and up to 2GB LPDDDR4 of RAM (depending on the version) has an MRSP of $120.99. Even with all 50 YouTubers each receiving their own, that\u2019s still just over $6000 USD of handhelds alone.While the Anbernic RG353V is not the most expensive, or even the most high-powered retro handheld out there, MrBeast\u2019s choice to give it away makes sense. The YouTuber has cited his love of the Nintendo Game Boy repeatedly in the past, even going so far as to commission a custom Game Boy from The Retro Future years ago.Related:MrBeast reveals insane ad revenue earned from Twitter/X videoArticle continues after adAlthough the RG353V is not an official Nintendo handheld, it takes after the Game Boy in multiple ways. Its form factor is highly reminiscent of that of the DMG model Game Boy but with some added extras. Article continues after adInstead of just a D-pad and two-button layout, the RG353V features a left stick, a full ABXY button layout, and built-in WiFi. Depending on the version MrBeast gave away, the retro handheld also has a touch-screen to use alongside Android-based games, a microSD card slot, and a 3200mAH rechargeable battery. Maybe some of these creators will fall in love with the emerging retro handheld emulator scene.Article continues after adkeep readingYouTubeMrBeast breaks his own record for day-one viewership with latest videoDaniel ApplefordYouTubeEvery creator in MrBeast\u2019s $1 million YouTuber challenge & how they got eliminatedCarver FisherYouTubeMrBeast reveals video idea he wasn\u2019t allowed to makeAlice Sj\u00f6bergEntertainmentHow to apply for MrBeast\u2019s $5 million Beast Games competitionMeera JackaYouTubeMrBeast urges billionaires to put their \u201cunfathomable wealth\u201d into YouTube contentMichael GwilliamYouTubeMrBeast reveals how much money he\u2019s made reposting old YouTube videos to XMeera JackaYouTubeMrBeast\u2019s Beast Games: Prize, where to watch & moreShay RobsonEntertainmentCreators furious as MrBeast nets $250K on Twitter/X for posting old videoVirginia GlazeRelated TopicsHandheldslilypichuMrbeastAbout The AuthorRosalie NewcombeDexerto's Senior Tech Writer.

In previous years various amounts up to \u00a3100,000 were received as a grant. However this year, due to budgetary restrictions, the annual grant has been limited to \u00a340,000 and sadly costs have not gone down and in fact have increased substantially,\u201d Mr Higgins said.A Lancaster flying high at the Jersey International Air Display in 2023 Picture: DAVID FERGUSON. (38594549)A crowdfunding page has been launched and Mr Higgins said that if each person who watched the display were to donate \u00a35, it would not only fund this year\u2019s display but also put the event on a more sustainable footing for the future.\u201cThe Jersey International Air Display is part of the DNA of our Island community. Not only is it a significant event in the Island\u2019s calendar for locals and visitors alike but, with its origins in the previous Battle of Britain Air Display, it also remains a poignant reminder of the reasons behind our Liberation, and our liberty. It also remains a significant day for relevant charities to raise funds to care for our military veterans,\u201d Mr Higgins said.Watched in person and online by more than 50,000 people \u2013 the organisers say \u2013 the display is funded from a combination of private and government sources. Mr Higgins explained that, having had to reduce its scale as a result of restrictions following the Covid pandemic, they now aspired to return the event to its previous stature with enhanced static displays and educational areas.Jersey International Air Display organiser Mike Higgins at the 2023 display Picture: James Jeune (38598762)Aircraft booked for the 2024 display include the \u00c9quipe de Voltige de l\u2019Arm\u00e9e de l\u2019Air (French Air Force Extra 330), the RAF Falcons parachute display team, the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Lancaster, the French North American OV-10 Bronco, French Conair Turbo Firecat (ex-S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Civile fire fighting aircraft), Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat and the Dutch Fokker D.XXI WW II fighter.Mr Higgins said that, in the event that the 2024 display did not take place, all funds raised would be put towards next year\u2019s event, or split between Jersey\u2019s Helping Wings charity and British Military Service charities if the decision were taken not to proceed permanently.Those wishing to support the event can do so using the link: sportsgiving.co.uk/sponsor/activity/appeal-for-12-september-2024/jersey-international-air-display.
