Relatively poor red LED  performance is a roadblock on the route to full-color displays based on InGaN  LED technology. Apart from much lower cost, the advantage of using silicon  substrates include better thermal conductivity than the more usual  sapphire-based epitaxy.\\nThe epitaxial structure for the red  micro-LED arrays was grown by metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition (MOCVD) on 4-inch Si (111)  wafers (Figure 1). The buffer region was  1.3\\u03bcm, followed by 2\\u03bcm n-GaN contact. The  superlattice consisted of 10 pairs of  0.9/5nm Al0.04Ga0.96N/In0.05Ga0.95N. \\n\\n Figure 1: (a) InGaN/GaN red micro-LED  epitaxial structure. (b) Transmission electron microscope (TEM) image. (c)  Fabrication process flow and photograph inset of InGaN/GaN red micro-LEDs on  4-inch silicon wafer.\\nThe active light-generating region  consisted of a three-well multiple quantum well  (MQW). The wells were 2.4nm In0.23Al0.05Ga0.72N separated by 10nm  GaN barriers. The MQW was capped with 12nm AlGaN varying in Al-content in three  steps (13%, 7%, 42%). The structure was completed with 150nm p-GaN as the  contact layer.\\nThe researchers used the material to  fabricate the red micro-LED arrays. The first step was deposition of 200nm  annealed indium tin oxide (ITO) as a transparent ohmic conductor  p-electrode. The mesa structures for the individual LEDs were fabricated through  a three-step inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etching  process. The steps consisted of ITO etching, hydrochloric acid treatment to remove ITO residues, and the  final etching down to the n-GaN layer.\\nThe metal contacts with the common  n-electrode and ITO p-contact consisted of chromium/gold (Cr/Au), deposited  after 500nm silicon nitride (SiNx) CVD passivation. A passive matrix  (PM) array format was used to wire the LEDs together in pixels.\\nThe researchers point out that all these  processes were carried out at the 4-inch wafer scale. The team comments: \\u201cIn  semiconductor fabrication, the most effective way to lower costs is through  large-scale wafer-level fabrication, as it allows for the production of a  larger number of devices in a single process.\\u201d\\nThe dark current  density under reverse bias was below 1\\u03bcA/cm2 for all devices sizes from 5\\u03bcm  to 100\\u03bcm.\\nThe LEDs suffered a blue-shift in  wavelength as the injection current  density increased. For arrays of 12\\u03bcm LEDs, the wavelength shifted from 648nm to 624nm for injections  between 3A/cm2 and 30A/cm2,  respectively. Standard red 642nm emission occurred at 5A/cm2.\\nThe full-width at half maximum (FWHM) for  the LEDs was around 65nm at low injection, narrowing to 50nm at 30A/cm2. This put a large  chunk of the emissions in the \\u2018orange\\u2019 range (590\\u2013625nm) rather than \\u2018red\\u2019  (625\\u2013750nm).\\nThe researchers comment: \\u201cThe peak wavelength  shift in InGaN quantum wells was  attributed to the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) and the band-filling  effect.\\u201d\\nThe QCSE results from shifts in the energy  levels due to the different combinations of applied electric field and electric fields arising from the  strain-dependent contrasts in the charge polarization of the different In AlGaN  alloys making up the epitaxial structure.\\nThe band-filling effect refers to the  filling up of the conduction and valence bands and localized states (as is  common in high-indium-content InGaN, which tends to have more non-uniform indium  concentrations) at higher current injection  \\u2014 an electron from the top of the conduction band has to transit a larger  energy difference to recombine with a hole, creating a higher-energy/shorter-wavelength  photon.\\nThe \\u2018dominant\\u2019 wavelength, taking into  account the perception of a normal human eye  and reducing it to a single wavelength, was determined, showing that the the  LEDs were more orange than red. The largest 100\\u03bcm LEDs recorded a dominant wavelength between 612nm  and 588nm for injections between 10 and 130A/cm2, respectively. The corresponding  dominant wavelength range for the 5\\u03bcm devices was 610\\u2013583nm.\\n\\nFigure 2: EQE of InGaN/GaN MQW red micro-LEDs with different device sizes.\\nThe peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) ranged from 0.52% for the 5\\u03bcm LED down to 0.36% for 100\\u03bcm (Figure 2). The injections at which the peak occurred  varied between 3A/cm2 and 5A/cm2,  but without any clear trend, suggesting that the differences were due to  process variations. By contrast, the competing red LED  technology based on III-phosphide materials suffers a large shift in peak EQE injection current  with size.\\nThe higher EQE for the smaller InGaN  devices is explained as being due both to the reduction of sidewall  recombination, relative to phosphide-based LEDs, and higher light-extraction  efficiency (LEE).\\nThe carriers in InGaN are more likely to be  trapped in localized states, rather than traveling to the sidewalls for  non-radiative recombination. The small devices also allow more light to escape  rather than being trapped by total internal reflection  effects, increasing LEE.\\nThe team also compares their work with  recent reports from University of California at Santa Barbara  (UCSB) and South China Normal University  for red InGaN micro-LEDs on silicon. The USCB and South China  data points for peak EQE were 0.021% and 2.3%, respectively.\\nThe team sees the 5\\u03bcm device as being particularly suitable for  displays: the peak EQE occurs around 3A/cm2, which corresponds to a low drive current of 0.75\\u03bcA, which could be supplied by mainstream silicon CMOS device drivers.\\nThe researchers suggest that further  developments could enhance the EQE such as by removing the silicon substrate  through wafer bonding, by optimizing the device structure for higher LEE, and  by optimizing the buffer to alleviate strain induced by high indium incorporation.\\nThe team also demonstrate the ability to  produce images by selective wiring on 5\\u03bcm and 12\\u03bcm  LED arrays (Figure 3). The smaller  devices naturally achieved a higher resolution.\\n\\nFigure 3: Images of various arrays being  driven at various injections. \\nGiven the limitations of InGaN LED devices,  the researchers suggest that pulse-width modulation (PWM), rather than  pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) might be a better method to control LED  brightness. The said limitations include efficiency and wavelength variations  with current injection, hence the desirability of using a fixed current injection amplitude. \\n The researchers found a linear dependence  of light luminance between 476nits and 4148nits (candela/m2) for pulse duty cycles varying between 10% and 90%,  respectively, on a 12\\u03bcm  LED biased at 3.3V, giving current injection of 3A/cm2.\\nThe researchers comment: \\u201cThese  measurements confirmed that it is possible to represent grayscale with red emission without peak shift using PWM in  InGaN/GaN red micro-LED devices.\\u201d \\nTags: InGaN micro-LEDs GaN InGaN MOCVD\\nVisit: https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.525680\\nThe  author Mike Cooke is a freelance technology journalist who has worked in the  semiconductor and advanced technology sectors since 1997.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\nFollow us\\r\\n    on X (Twitter)\\n\\n \\nJoin our LinkedIn network\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a92006-2024 Juno Publishing and Media Solutions Ltd.

All this took place while it released multiple LEDs targeted toward high-efficacy and high color-quality applications, such as indoor and outdoor directional lighting and large-format displays \\u2014 four of which received LEDs Magazine BrightStar Awards recognition in 2024.\\nLEDs editor-in-chief Carrie Meadows recently sat down with Cree LED president Joe Clark to discuss in more detail factors that contributed to sales recovery, the unit\\u2019s development and outsourcing approaches, and prospects for advances such as micro LEDs.\\nLEDs Magazine: The first fiscal quarter (end Dec. 1) sales for Cree LED were up 11.5%. Then again in 2Q24, sales rose by 8% compared to a year ago. To what do you credit this recovery?\\nJoe Clark: There are a number of factors. The market was down pretty dramatically in FY23. At that point, we saw excess inventory. That inventory \\u2014 both our customers\\u2019 and within our own channel \\u2014 has largely been burned off and things are in a much more stable, sensible place.\\nWe\\u2019ve also refocused our team. You alluded to our move to a new site, so a lot of activity was happening around that. It was not specific to the customer-facing nature of the business, but now we\\u2019re refocused and getting good traction with key customers. We\\u2019re also identifying new customers or old customers that we are going back to and rekindling relationships. That has been a positive influence on the most recent numbers.Adobe stock imageLEDs: How has the change to an outsourced manufacturing model been going, and how has it affected Cree LED\\u2019s results from these past two quarters?\\nClark: It\\u2019s going quite well. It certainly allowed us to serve customer demand effectively and allowed us to maintain our focus and energy where it really needs to be, which is on innovation. We\\u2019ve been able to do that while minimizing capital expenditures and other costs. It\\u2019s a model that\\u2019s pretty unique to us within the LED business.\\nLEDs: Do you have any plans to modify other parts of your operation in an outsourcing model?\\nClark: Yes, we\\u2019re constantly working with our outsource partners, evaluating what\\u2019s available out there, where we should be geographically. Also, what technology we need to be pairing up with and utilizing, and how we get the best result for our customers. Our objective is always to use our technology and innovation to the best advantage for ourselves and our stakeholders.\\nLEDs: What kinds of products or trends are you seeing in terms of demographics? During another interview, Inventronics representatives talked about the difference between what they\\u2019re offering for Europe versus what they\\u2019re planning to offer for North America. It\\u2019s an interesting conversation to open up with different players in the supply chain.\\nClark: We see different needs in different places. Some of it depends on how we do our business, say, through distributors and through the supply channel. A lot of business in Asia is done in that way, but it tends to be very cost sensitive. At the same time, some of the business we\\u2019re doing in Asia is coming back into Europe or the United States. It sometimes gets a little muddy geographically, but we see opportunity everywhere. I think our recent results and our new product introductions have shown that to be the case.\\nWe\\u2019ve recently been actively focused on the portable device space. It\\u2019s a space that we think we helped define over the last decades. Some of our new product offerings are focused on that portable space, and we\\u2019re getting good traction with various customers.\\nLEDs: Turning back to the newer facility in Research Triangle Park, how is that environment influencing your processes and operations overall?\\nClark: It\\u2019s been wonderful; I\\u2019m positively delighted by it. Before, we were scattered across the various corners of a campus that was no longer ours, and now we have the team together again in one place. Previously, there was some distraction, both in terms of people being separate and then also in the very act of moving to the facility. Now we have our pilot line, our operations teams, commercial teams, and development team here. Everybody\\u2019s interacting! And when I\\u2019m not on the road, more customers are visiting us now. We can host them and show off our space; it\\u2019s great for the team and for our overall business.Image courtesy of Cree LEDCree LED received 2024 BrightStar Awards for its XLamp XP-G4 White, J Series 2835 Pro9, J Series 5050C E Class, and High Brightness LEDs.LEDs: Speaking of product development, congratulations on your multiple Bright Star Awards this year! Cree LED earned recognition for four individual products. What do you think sets your product development apart from its competition?\\nClark: Again, we\\u2019re focused relentlessly on application-specific innovation. We\\u2019ve been doing this for a long time. We\\u2019ve got a fantastic team here; these awards and the recent product announcements that we\\u2019ve made highlight the broad cross-section of applications that we\\u2019re focused on, the effectiveness of the development team, and the model that we\\u2019re using. So I\\u2019m delighted that we\\u2019ve won awards, and with the new products that we\\u2019re announcing, as well as the products we have in the pipeline. We\\u2019re actively working to effectively commercialize these things and recognize the value for our customers, shareholder, and stakeholders.\\nLEDs: Also development related\\u2026 Cree LED announced its licensing of the Current KSF [potassium fluorosilicate], a narrow-band red phosphor, not too long ago. What role has that technology played in your most recent product developments? Has the license opened up new application opportunities?\\nClark: [The KSF phosphor] certainly opens up opportunity. Still, it\\u2019s a material system that we have been working with for a long time, so we have a lot of experience with it. It allows for higher efficiency within the high-CRI spaces, and that opens up certain applications, many of which are more indoor related. But we\\u2019re also finding applications and opportunities in higher-power discrete devices. Our offerings are unique in that sense. We\\u2019re going to use that technology to its fullest extent.\\nLEDs: Here\\u2019s a \\u201cbonus question\\u201d we\\u2019ve been talking about internally \\u2014 the roadmap and potential of micro LEDs. Where is Cree LED in the micro LED conversation? Is this something that has a lot of potential in the near term?\\nClark: Ah! We have done an enormous amount of work over many years in various display applications, and we have chosen to take a \\u201cwait and see\\u201d approach with regard to micro LED. That perspective has been largely validated by things that have been happening out in the industry.\\nI don\\u2019t see [micro LED] being the panacea that some of our competitors think it might be. I think it\\u2019s going to result in a lot of investment made \\u2014 enormous capex \\u2014 and I don\\u2019t think anybody is going to make an enormous return on that investment. I could be wrong, of course. But it\\u2019s not a place that we are actively chasing right now. We do have a lot of intellectual property and past R&D effort focused on various areas that would be adjacent. When the time comes, we\\u2019ll participate in a meaningful way.\\nLEDs: The industry is still struggling in terms of micro LED manufacturing and assembly, cost, and the finite types of applications we\\u2019re seeing for now. You mentioned displays which begs the question of the market: How much demand is there, really, for extremely large displays with very fine pixel pitch? That\\u2019s such a specialized application.\\nClark: We play in that particular application; we already have offerings for fine-pitch video applications. To me, the micro LED conversation becomes largely consumer electronics focused \\u2014 maybe automotive displays \\u2014 and then it becomes a race to the bottom in terms of cost. You\\u2019re going to have to spend enormous amounts of money to really play meaningfully in that space. Then you\\u2019re going to be relentlessly cost pressured to move any kind of real volume; that\\u2019s a little bit outside of our typical business model. We\\u2019re happily watching it play out and interested in how it all transpires.\\nLEDs: You mentioned doing the research and exploring the viability of the application, the cost proposal there and determining ROI. I\\u2019m having a hard time thinking micro LED is there right now, to be honest. I don\\u2019t believe we\\u2019ve hit the peak of LED technology, that it is never going to scale any further than it is now. Smaller could happen, but where and when and why?\\nClark: Yes \\u2014 and how is it economically feasible? How do you make money doing it? I don\\u2019t have answers to that right now. We have talked to a lot of partners and people in the industry, and I haven\\u2019t really gotten a compelling argument from any of them as to how they\\u2019re going to do it. Everyone is mainly saying it is so far out.\\nVisit Cree LED online\\n\\u00a0\\nThis interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\\n\\nFollow our\\u00a0LinkedIn page\\u00a0for our latest news updates, contributed articles, and commentary, and our\\u00a0Facebook page\\u00a0for events announcements and more.

Similarly, the Europe, North America and RoW regions are expected to be the growing market for the forecasted period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nMarketsandMarkets Logo\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDownload PDF Brochure:\\u00a0https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/pdfdownloadNew.asp?id=925\\nBrowse in-depth TOC on \\\"Display Market\\\"\\u00a0100 \\u2013 Tables65 \\u2013 Figures210 \\u2013 Pages\\nDisplay Market Report\\u00a0Scope:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReport Coverage \\nDetails \\n\\n\\nMarket Revenue in 2024 \\n$ 135.2 billion \\n\\n\\nEstimated Value by 2029 \\n$ 173.7 billion \\n\\n\\nGrowth Rate \\nPoised to grow at a CAGR of 5.1% \\n\\n\\nMarket Size Available for \\n2020\\u20132029 \\n\\n\\nForecast Period \\n2024\\u20132029 \\n\\n\\nForecast Units \\nValue (USD Million/Billion) \\n\\n\\nReport Coverage \\nRevenue Forecast, Competitive Landscape, Growth Factors, and Trends \\n\\n\\nSegments Covered \\nBy Display Technology, Resolution, Panel Size, Panel Type, Dimension, Product, Vertical and Region \\n\\n\\nGeographies Covered \\nNorth America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Rest of World \\n\\n\\nKey Market Challenge \\nHigh costs associated with new display technology-based products \\n\\n\\nKey Market Opportunities \\nIncreasing adoption of AMOLED displays, especially post 5G rollout \\n\\n\\nKey Market Drivers \\nRobust application of displays in automotive and healthcare industries \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe consumer electronics segment currently leads the display market and is expected to have the largest market share in the forecast period.The consumer electronics market has seen a surge in demand for high quality and high-resolution displays in recent years. Organic light emitting diode OLED\\u00a0and liquid crystal display LCD dominate the market. Nevertheless, other display technologies such as micro-LED, quantum dot\\u00a0displays, and mini-LED are gaining popularity due to their superior picture quality, high contrast ratio, and energy efficiency.OLED displays are becoming more popular, especially in the high-end smartphone and TV markets, because they're thin, flexible, and bright. OLED displays have higher contrast ratio and viewing angles than LCDs. The high-end TV market is shifting from LCD technology to LCD due to this change.LCD displays are a popular choice for midrange and budget friendly smartphones and TVs because they are cheap. LCD market is facing challenges due to oversupply and price competition, leading market players to focus on developing panels using advanced display technologies such as mini-LEDs and quantum dot displays. Micro-LED is a new display technology that combines the advantages of OLED displays and LCD displays, such as high contrast ratio, broad color gamut, and low power consumption. Micro-LED\\u00a0displays are still being explored by manufacturers for potential uses, even though they are still in their early stages and cost. Micro-LED is to make big strides in the display industry and will be used in a range of applications including smartphones, TVs, and wearables.Consumer electronics and displays are poised to thrive in the upcoming years, with the growing demand for high-quality displays in a variety of devices. Smartphones, TVs, and smart wearables, like smartwatches and VR HMDs, are expected to be the main drivers of this growth. The demand for larger and higher resolution displays is expected to increase, driven by the increasing popularity of advanced display technologies like quantum dots, micro-LED, and mini-LED. Display is expected to remain fiercely competitive as manufacturers continue to innovate and commercialize new technologies that meet the evolving needs of consumers.LCD display technology is predicted to have the largest market share in the forecast period.Liquid crystal display technology is widely used in modern display devices such as televisions, computer monitors and smartphones. An LCD is a liquid crystal that has been electronically modified to pass or block light. The lens is comprised between two flexible electrodes and two polarizing filters, and the alignment of the lenses determines how much light passes through the display, three subpixels are used on LCD displays to create colors, each with a color special filter\\u2014red, green, and deep. By changing the intensity of each subpixel, the display can produce millions of colors.LCD technology replaced numerous technologies, along with cathode ray tube (CRT) and plasma shows. LCDs are thinner, lighter, and consume less strength.

Samsung is best known for its smartphones, tablets and consumer electronics devices yet the conglomerate is very diversified. It also manufactures mobile processors, memory products, image sensors, display panels and home appliances.\\nIt entered the electronics market back in the 1960s and has achieved great success since. It wasn\\u2019t until 2009 that Samsung started competing in the mobile market. The humble Samsung Galaxy was the first smartphone that it released back in 2009. Samsung kept releasing new models in subsequent years and eventually introduced the first Samsung Galaxy Note in 2011.\\nIt was an unusual device for the time but has since made a significant contribution in shifting the industry to adopt larger displays. Samsung has also released countless tablets, wearable devices and smart home devices, rounding out a complete ecosystem.\\nTen years later, Samsung broke new ground in 2019 with its first foldable smartphone. The Galaxy Fold might just define the next decade of smartphone design and Samsung will certainly be at the forefront of it.\\n\\nSamsung had established itself as a dominating force in the TV market long before it entered the mobile market. It launched its first television \\u2013 a 12-inch black and white model \\u2013 called the P-3202 in 1970. In just two years, the company became the largest producer of black and white TVs in the world.\\nSince the mid-2000s, Samsung has maintained the world's largest market share in global TV shipments. Over the years, it has launched LCD, LED, 3D and OLED TVs. The company\\u2019s premium TVs now utilize its QLED technology and it\\u2019s working on bringing the next-generation microLED TVs to market as well.\\nSamsung was also among the first companies to use AMOLED displays for mobile phones. The Samsung i7110 came out in February 2009 and it featured a 2.6-inch AMOLED display. By 2004, Samsung had already become the world's largest manufacturer of OLED panels and now it has over a 90 percent share of the global AMOLED market.\\nSamsung has also been in the business of manufacturing mobile processors since the year 2000. It brought them under its Exynos brand in 2009 and now uses Exynos SoCs in many of its flagship and mid-range devices. The company also sells mobile processors to other manufacturers. With Samsung going all-in on 5G, the company has also made 5G modems for both high-end and mid-range Exynos processors. It also dominates the memory chip market.\\nThe Korean conglomerate develops its own custom Android skin for Galaxy devices called One UI. It adds a lot of functionality on top of the core operating system. Bixby, Samsung\\u2019s very own conversational voice assistant, is part and parcel of its custom software in addition to features like Samsung Pay, Secure Folder, DeX and more.\\nAt SamMobile, we keep a close eye on all Samsung-related developments. You can get the latest news about all Samsung mobile and wearable devices in addition to reviews, opinions, polls, tips & tricks, deals and more. We also have just about every Samsung firmware available in our database.

It launches flagship smartphones as part of its Galaxy S and Galaxy Note lineups. Premium mid-range and mid-range devices are launched as part of the Galaxy A series. The Galaxy M lineup of entry-level devices has largely been limited to India. All of Samsung's recent handsets in these series are listed below.

Samsung followed it up with the Galaxy Z Flip in 2020 and has updated the models ever since. That's also when it brought the Galaxy Fold under the Galaxy Z series, thereby highlighting the fact that future foldable smartphones may also be released as part of this series.\\nGalaxy Z series\\n\\nGalaxy Z Flip\\nGalaxy Z Flip 3\\nGalaxy Z Flip 4\\nGalaxy Z Flip 5\\nGalaxy Z Flip 6\\nGalaxy Z Fold\\nGalaxy Z Fold 2\\nGalaxy Z Fold 3\\nGalaxy Z Fold 4\\nGalaxy Z Fold 5\\nGalaxy Z Fold 6\\n\\nTablets\\n\\nSamsung is one of the few Android OEMs still competing in the Android tablet market.

The company later released an improved version of the earbuds called the Galaxy Buds+ in 2020. Then came the Galaxy Buds Live which were Samsung's first truly wireless earbuds that featured Active Noise Cancellation. Samsung launched another ANC-equipped pair, the Galaxy Buds Pro, in 2021 followed by the Galaxy Buds 2.

These are more affordable options for customers who don't necessarily need a smartwatch but are willing to purchase a fitness tracker. The company also launched its first smart ring, the Galaxy Ring, in 2024.\\nGalaxy Ring\\n\\nGalaxy Ring\\n\\nGalaxy Fit\\n\\nGalaxy Ring\\nGalaxy Fit\\nGalaxy Fit 2\\nGalaxy Fit 3\\nGalaxy Fit e\\n\\nSmart Home\\nSamsung has built a serious smart home ecosystem over the past decade as the market as moved towards widespread adoption of connected devices. The company really amped up its efforts in this space with the 2014 acquisition of SmartThings for $200 million. That acquisition was seen by the industry as Samsung making a long-term commitment to the Internet of Things space.\\nThe SmartThings Hub acts as the brain of the connected home, allowing users to control their smart locks, thermostats, speakers, outlets, TVs and even appliances like refrigerators and washing machines. It works with 100s of compatible devices from third-party manufacturers like Philips, Ring, Honeywell, Yale, Kwikset, Schlage as well as the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa voice assistants. Samsung also sells a mesh Wi-fi system, a smart camera and a tracker under the SmartThings umbrella.\\nSamsung also entered the smart speaker race with the Galaxy Home back in 2018. However, despite it being almost two years since this product was unveiled, it's yet to be launched to the public. The company has since unveiled the Galaxy Home mini but that's only seen a limited release in South Korea so far.\\n\\nGalaxy Home\\nGalaxy Home mini\\n\\nTV\\nSamsung has been the world's largest manufacturer of televisions for more than a decade. The company continues to innovate in this space and dominates the premium segment of the market in particular. It was also among the very first TV manufacturers to release 8K TVs to the public. The Samsung Q950TS 8K QLED TV series was unveiled in 2020 with a next-generation Quantum Processor 8K that can use AI to upscale any content to 8K.\\nMicro LED is just one of the advanced technologies that Samsung is working on to further enhance the TV experience. It already launched the micro LED-based The Wall in 2018. It's a modular TV which can be scaled in size significantly. A 292-inch 8K version of The Wall was also released by Samsung, in addition to offering the model in 88-inch, 93-inch, 110-inch, and 150-inch sizes.\\nThe company uses three primary advanced display panel technologies for its premium TVs.\\n\\nQLED\\nQD-OLED\\nMicroLED\\nQLED vs. QD-OLED vs. Micro LED\\n\\nSamsung also has a Lifestyle TV lineup which while offering an unrivaled viewing experience, also has unconventional designs that really transform these TVs into decorative objects. The series includes three primary models.\\n\\nThe Frame\\nThe Sero\\nThe Terrace\\nThe Freestyle\\n\\nLaptops and Chromebooks\\nSamsung has been in the business of making laptops since the 1990s. The Sens 810 Notebook from 1996 was one of its earliest creations with a curved butterfly keyboard for easier typing.\\u00a0Samsung gradually expanded its lineup in the years to come and made its laptops available in more markets, but the company wouldn't start selling them in the United States until 2008.\\nIt was also one of the first few companies to launch Chromebooks back when Google announced Chrome OS in 2011. The Samsung Series 5 Chromebook was soon followed by new models almost every year.\\u00a0The Galaxy Chromebook is Samsung's flagship offering, with features like a 4K AMOLED display, latest Intel 10th Gen Core i5 processor and a built-in S Pen.\\nSamsung's Windows-powered laptops have also come a long way. The company's lineup now includes gaming notebooks, entry-level laptops, ultra-portable machines, 2-in-1 convertibles, and even laptops with its QLED display technology.\\nWhile Samsung continues to sell its laptops and Chromebooks in many countries across the globe, the company decided to pull out of the market in Europe back in 2014.\\n\\nGalaxy Book S\\nGalaxy Book Flex alpha\\nGalaxy Book Ion\\nGalaxy Book 3 Ultra\\nGalaxy Book 3 360\\nGalaxy Book 4\\nGalaxy Book 4 Pro\\nNotebook Odyssey\\nGalaxy Chromebook\\nChromebook Plus\\n\\nGalaxy AI\\n\\nGalaxy AI is a suite of Artificial Intelligence-based features that Samsung introduced with the Galaxy S24 series in 2024. It lays the foundation of what an AI smartphone can be, as Galaxy AI enables users to do a lot more with their phones that wasn't previously possible.\\nAt launch, the Galaxy AI suite has the following features:\\n\\nGenerative Edit: Intelligent photo editing, removal of objects and people, AI pixel generation.\\nGenerative Wallpapers: Create new and unique wallpapers with AI keywords.\\nLive Translate Call: Have conversations with people in another language through automatic live call translation.\\nInterpreter: Live in-person translation of other languages for easier real-world conversations with people who speak a different language.\\nChat Assist: Keyboard's AI capabilities performs grammar checks, provides tone suggestions, and live translations.\\nNote Assist: Native Samsung Note app provides intelligent summaries, spell checks, and translations.\\nTranscript Assist: Native Voice Recorder app uses AI to automatically transcript and translate voice recordings.\\nBrowsing Assist: Samsung Internet browser has AI capabilities for summarizing and translating webpages.\\nCircle to Search: Search anything displayed on the screen through Google by drawing a circle around it.\\nInstant Slow-Mo: Instantly view specific portions of a video in slow-motion and create edited clips.\\nEdit Suggestions: Get suggestions for erasing shadows, reflections, and remastering images in the native Gallery app.\\n\\nGalaxy AI is available across the entire Galaxy S24 lineup and will also be included in future models. Samsung rolled it out for the 2023 flagship series as well, bringing the features to more than 100 million devices across the Galaxy S23 and Galaxy Z Flip 5/Fold 5 lineups. Some Galaxy AI features have also been released for the 2022 and 2021 flagships.\\n\\nSamsung Galaxy AI: Eligible phones and tablets\\n\\nSamsung Pay\\nSamsung offers customers its own mobile payments service called Samsung Pay. It was announced back in 2015 and went live in South Korea on August 20 of that year. About a month later, the service was released for users in the United States.\\nSamsung Pay is fundamentally different from other mobile payment services. That's because it supports both NFC and regular credit card terminals. Its support for MST or magnetic secure transmission technology allows users to pay with Samsung Pay anywhere they can pay with a card, provided that the point-of-sale unit doesn't require the card to be physically inserted into the slot.\\nThis meant that shop owners didn't have to acquire expensive NFC terminals in order to accept Samsung Pay. They could start accepting payments through this service using the normal credit card machines that they already have in the store.\\nThe service's functionality has been expanded over the years to cover everything from transit and bill payments to cash withdrawal at ATMs and even money transfers. A Samsung Pay debit card will also be launched in the United States later this year.\\n\\nSamsung Pay \\u2013 All Supported Devices And Countries\\n\\nBixby Virtual Assistant\\nIn 2017, Samsung launched Bixby, it's very own digital personal assistant that's meant to compete with the likes of Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. Samsung has continued to improve the assistant's functionality over the years, adding new features and further enhancing its capabilities.\\nThe major components of its virtual assistant are Bixby Home, Bixby Voice, Bixby Vision and Bixby Routines. This entire suite of features allows for conversational voice control, surfaces contextual information, powers augmented reality experiences and helps automate many routine tasks that people perform on their phones.\\n\\nBixby Home\\nBixby Voice\\nBixby Vision\\nBixby Routines\\n    Load More           Home   News  Samsung over the years       \\n       \\u00a9 2024 SamMobile           Support     Team     Contact     Terms & Conditions     Privacy & Cookies             Support     Team     Contact       Terms & Conditions     Privacy & Cookies                            \\n               We'd like to show you notifications for the latest important news and updates   Close Allow        \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\",\n        \"type\": \"Document\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"lc\": 1,\n      \"type\": \"constructor\",\n      \"id\": [\n        \"langchain\",\n        \"schema\",\n        \"document\",\n        \"Document\"\n      ],\n      \"kwargs\": {\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"source\": \"https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/markets/markets-news/GetNews/27431899/neareye-display-market-size-projected-to-reach-usd-53-billion-by-2027-at-a-cagr-of-247\",\n          \"title\": \"The Globe and Mail - The Globe and Mail\",\n          \"description\": \"GetNews Press Release.\",\n          \"language\": \"en-CA\"\n        },\n        \"page_content\": \"The Globe and Mail - The Globe and Mail\\n\\nSkip to main contentSearchNewslettersWatchlistHomeWatchlistFor YouCanadaWorldBusinessInvestingPersonal FinanceOpinionPoliticsSportsLifeArtsDriveReal EstateLatest in Flash Sale$0.99/weekDigital accessDigital + home deliveryNear-Eye Display Market Size Projected to Reach USD 5.3 Billion by 2027, at a CAGR of 24.7%GetNews - TGAM - GetNews - Tue Jul 16, 5:06PM CDT \\\"Near-Eye Display Market Size\\\"  The Global Near-Eye Display Market Size is projected to reach USD 5.3 billion by 2027, growing at a CAGR of 24.7% during the forecast period.

Here, we report results from the RATE-AF trial wearables study, which was designed to compare heart rate in older, multimorbid patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and heart failure who were randomized to treatment with either digoxin or beta-blockers. Heart rate (n\\u2009=\\u2009143,379,796) and physical activity (n\\u2009=\\u200923,704,307) intervals were obtained from 53 participants (mean age 75.6\\u2009years (s.d. 8.4), 40% women) using a wrist-worn wearable linked to a smartphone for 20\\u2009weeks. Heart rates in participants treated with digoxin versus beta-blockers were not significantly different (regression coefficient 1.22 (95% confidence interval (CI) \\u22122.82 to 5.27; P\\u2009=\\u20090.55); adjusted 0.66 (95% CI \\u22123.45 to 4.77; P\\u2009=\\u20090.75)). No difference in heart rate was observed between the two groups of patients after accounting for physical activity (P\\u2009=\\u20090.74) or patients with high activity levels (\\u226530,000\\u2009steps per week; P\\u2009=\\u20090.97). Using a convolutional neural network designed to account for missing data, we found that wearable device data could predict New York Heart Association functional class 5\\u2009months after baseline assessment similarly to standard clinical measures of electrocardiographic heart rate and 6-minute walk test (F1 score 0.56 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.70) versus 0.55 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.68); P\\u2009=\\u20090.88 for comparison). The results of this study indicate that digoxin and beta-blockers have equivalent effects on heart rate in atrial fibrillation at rest and on exertion, and suggest that dynamic monitoring of individuals with arrhythmia using wearable technology could be an alternative to in-person assessment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02391337 . In a substudy of the RATE-AF trial, which compared heart rate control therapy using digoxin or the beta-blocker bisoprolol, heart rate and physical activity data collected using a wearable device showed equivalent heart rate control by the two drugs and could be used to predict future heart failure functional class as well as standard clinical measurements.\",\n          \"language\": \"en\"\n        },\n        \"page_content\": \"\\n\\n\\nConsumer wearable devices for evaluation of heart rate control using digoxin versus beta-blockers: the RATE-AF randomized trial | Nature Medicine\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main content\\n\\n\\nThank you for visiting nature.com.

Here, we report results from the RATE-AF trial wearables study, which was designed to compare heart rate in older, multimorbid patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and heart failure who were randomized to treatment with either digoxin or beta-blockers. Heart rate (n\\u2009=\\u2009143,379,796) and physical activity (n\\u2009=\\u200923,704,307) intervals were obtained from 53 participants (mean age 75.6\\u2009years (s.d. 8.4), 40% women) using a wrist-worn wearable linked to a smartphone for 20\\u2009weeks. Heart rates in participants treated with digoxin versus beta-blockers were not significantly different (regression coefficient 1.22 (95% confidence interval (CI) \\u22122.82 to 5.27; P\\u2009=\\u20090.55); adjusted 0.66 (95% CI \\u22123.45 to 4.77; P\\u2009=\\u20090.75)). No difference in heart rate was observed between the two groups of patients after accounting for physical activity (P\\u2009=\\u20090.74) or patients with high activity levels (\\u226530,000\\u2009steps per week; P\\u2009=\\u20090.97). Using a convolutional neural network designed to account for missing data, we found that wearable device data could predict New York Heart Association functional class 5\\u2009months after baseline assessment similarly to standard clinical measures of electrocardiographic heart rate and 6-minute walk test (F1 score 0.56 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.70) versus 0.55 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.68); P\\u2009=\\u20090.88 for comparison). The results of this study indicate that digoxin and beta-blockers have equivalent effects on heart rate in atrial fibrillation at rest and on exertion, and suggest that dynamic monitoring of individuals with arrhythmia using wearable technology could be an alternative to in-person assessment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02391337.\\n\\n\\n\\nMainThe effectiveness and safety of therapeutic interventions are traditionally evaluated with periodic, single time-point assessments. In patients with cardiovascular disease, this often requires multiple clinical visits to obtain tests such as electrocardiograms (ECG) for assessment of heart rate, or 6-minute walk (6MW) tests to appraise physical capacity. These in-hospital measurements are time-consuming, costly and not dynamic, providing a limited \\u2018snapshot\\u2019 of that person\\u2019s functional status1,2. Wearable technology can provide continuous measurement of physiological parameters3,4,5. However the large volume of data acquired may need advanced analytics, taking account of the lower quality compared with medical devices or frequent missing values6.A prime example of the potential clinical value of wearable sensor data could be therapy choice and dose adjustment for heart rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), an increasingly common rhythm disorder. There is a limited evidence base on this topic; for example, digoxin has typically been considered a poorly effective drug for controlling heart rate, particularly on exertion, although this is based on acute studies only7. Wearables offer an opportunity to assess each patient in their own environment, with longer-term evaluation better reflecting the extended time taken to achieve therapeutic benefit from digoxin8, and properly account for physical activity.Although there is considerable potential for consumer-wearable devices to contribute to cardiovascular disease management, there are few robust studies independent of manufacturers that can highlight opportunities as well as limitations in older, multimorbid patients9. Embedded in a randomized controlled trial to mitigate the effects of unmeasured or unknown confounders10, we hypothesized that a wrist-worn wearable could: (1) address whether digoxin is inferior to beta-blockers for longer-term heart rate control in patients with AF at rest and on exertion; (2) adjust for differences in individual physical activity; and (3) explore whether wearable sensor data are comparable with conventional measurements for the prediction of clinical progress, and ultimately, aid longer-term patient management.ResultsOne hundred and sixty patients were randomized to digoxin or beta-blocker therapy in the RAte control Therapy Evaluation in permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RATE-AF) trial, of whom 72 (36 from each treatment arm) were eligible to participate in a substudy that provided a wrist-worn wearable and a connected smartphone. The design and deployment of the study were aided by a patient and public involvement team11. The remaining participants had completed the main trial or did not have sufficient time left for data collection (Fig. 1). Of those eligible, 8 in the digoxin group and 11 in the beta-blocker group declined to participate, principally because they did not want to use a wearable device or attend further trial appointments. The characteristics of those who declined were similar to the participating cohort, apart from more women declining and with a lower 6MW distance (Extended Data Table 1).Fig. 1: RATE-AF wearables substudy flowchart.Flowchart for the wearables study enrollment.Full size imageFifty-three participants were enrolled in the substudy (Extended Data Fig. 1), with mean age at randomization of 75.6\\u2009years (s.d. 8.4; range 61 to 90 years) and 40% women. Twenty-eight participants (53%) had been randomized to digoxin and 25 (47%) to beta-blockers a mean of 30\\u2009weeks before their entry into the wearables substudy (s.d. 8\\u2009weeks; range 12 to 46 weeks). Both groups were well balanced with respect to demographics and clinical measurements (Table 1), with the most common comorbidities being hypertension (74%) and heart failure (45%). There were more patients with a formal diagnosis of heart failure in the digoxin group, but ECG-derived left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured in a blinded fashion at the start of the trial was similar for both groups: 55.7% (s.d. 8.8%) for digoxin versus 55.4% (s.d. 9.0%) for beta-blockers. One patient from each arm was lost to follow-up.Table 1 Baseline characteristicsFull size tableHeart rate at the start of the substudy was 79.4\\u2009beats per minute (bpm; s.d. 12.2) in those randomized to digoxin and 73.1\\u2009bpm (s.d. 14.3) for beta-blockers, with one patient in each group presenting at that visit in sinus rhythm. The capacity for physical activity was similar in both groups at baseline, with a median 6MW distance of 351\\u2009m for digoxin (i.q.r. 120\\u2013454) and 357\\u2009m for beta-blockers (i.q.r. 295\\u2013411). Symptoms of AF and heart failure were reported in all patients (100%), with modified European Heart Rhythm Association (mEHRA) class 2a or above, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or above. At the trial mid-point, the mean dose of digoxin used was 157\\u2009\\u00b5g (s.d. 10\\u2009\\u00b5g) with a serum digoxin level of 0.79\\u2009ng\\u2009ml\\u22121 (s.d. 0.29); the mean dose in the beta-blocker group was 3.2\\u2009mg of bisoprolol (s.d. 1.9). The duration of the wearable substudy was a median of 23\\u2009weeks (i.q.r. 4\\u201338). There was consistent use of the wrist-worn wearable (more so than the smartphone), with 90.4% of participants using this every day for the last 7\\u2009days before the interim review (Extended Data Table 2).Wearable-acquired heart rate and physical activityPer patient, the mean duration of ambulatory sensor data collected was 20\\u2009weeks (s.d. 7), with an average of 2,623,951 heart rate data points for each patient treated with digoxin (s.d. 907,697) and 2,796,367 for each patient treated with beta-blocker (s.d. 811,956). Across all patients there were 143,379,796 data intervals collected for heart rate and 23,704,307 for corresponding physical activity (Table 2). Figure 2 highlights the considerable variability within and across individual patients despite appropriate rate control therapy in terms of heart rate, response to exertion and the correlation between heart rate and physical activity.Table 2 Sensor data from the wearable deviceFull size tableFig. 2: Wearable device data for measurement of heart rate and physical activity.a, Examples of data capture for heart rate (red lines) and step count (green bars) using a wrist-worn wearable and smartphone over a single 24-h period for two individual patients with AF and heart failure. b, Correlations between daytime 10-s intervals of heart rate and physical activity for 50 patients who remained in AF at each visit. Light blue columns indicate the range of positive and negative correlations between heart rate and physical activity, with medians indicated by dark blue bars (correlation <0.19, very weak; 0.20\\u20130.59, weak to moderate).Full size imageDigoxin versus beta-blockersWeekly averages of heart rate were no different when comparing patients randomized to digoxin or beta-blockers (Extended Data Table 3). Accounting for all repeated measurements over time, there was no significant difference in heart rate comparing digoxin and beta-blocker therapy using the wearable sensors (Fig. 3). There was no interaction seen according to gender (Pinteraction = 0.39). The unadjusted regression coefficient for digoxin versus beta-blockers was 1.22 (95% CI \\u22122.82 to 5.27; P\\u2009=\\u20090.55), and 0.66 when adjusted for age, gender, diagnosis of heart failure and N-terminal pro-hormone B-natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (95% CI \\u22123.45 to 4.77; P\\u2009=\\u20090.75). There remained no difference in heart rate between the digoxin and beta-blocker groups after accounting for physical activity (P\\u2009=\\u20090.74). Post-hoc adjusted subgroup analysis according to activity levels found no difference in heart rate between digoxin and beta-blockers in those with low weekly-averaged activity (<15,000\\u2009steps per week; 298 weeks from 44 patients; P\\u2009=\\u20090.48), minimum recommended activity (15,000\\u201330,000\\u2009steps per week; 316\\u2009weeks from 37 patients; P\\u2009=\\u20090.47) or recommended activity (\\u226530,000\\u2009steps per week; 417\\u2009weeks from 33 patients; P\\u2009=\\u20090.97).Fig. 3: Heart rate data from the wearable device.The start of the wearables study was preceded by a period of dose adjustment and stabilization (mean of 30\\u2009weeks from randomization). a, Mean (solid line) and s.d.

F1 scores (combining precision and recall) were used to compare the CNN model for prediction of NYHA class at the end of the trial (Extended Data Table 4), with chance returning an F1 score of 0.35. The wearables CNN yielded an F1 score of 0.56 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.70); Fig. 4. This was equivalent to a model generated from conventional trial parameters (ECG heart rate and 6MW test results), which returned an F1 score of 0.55 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.68); P\\u2009=\\u20090.88 for patient-level comparison with wearables CNN. The wearable data appeared independent of clinical factors such as age, gender and body mass index, with similar F1 score when combining wearable data with clinical factors (0.58; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.73). The corresponding areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves were 0.73 for ECG heart rate and 6MW test, 0.77 for the wearables CNN and 0.78 for wearables plus clinical factors.Fig. 4: Prediction of clinical progress with a neural network based on wearable data.F1 scores combining precision and recall of each model are presented along with 95% CI for the prediction of NYHA functional class at the end of follow-up (mean 5\\u2009months); an F1 score of 0.35 (dashed line) is equivalent to chance.

Embedded in a randomized trial, the study provides robust information on the value, but also the limitations of using these devices. The commonly held view originating from acute trials that digoxin is inferior to beta-blockers for heart rate control in AF was not seen in this longer-term study. No difference in heart rate was seen when considering more than 140 million data points at rest and on exertion during a 20-week period. The equivalence of digoxin to beta-blockers held after accounting for individual differences in day-to-day physical activity, and no difference in heart rate was evident even in periods with high activity. Although limited by the number of patients, the wearable sensor data appeared to be comparable with conventional trial outcomes for prediction of a clinical outcome (in this case, functional class), but required the development of a neural network pipeline for appropriate analytics. Standardization of these approaches could lead to wearable devices contributing to, or even replacing resource-intensive clinical tests and visits in the future.The majority of clinical trials in cardiovascular research utilize in-person periodic testing that not only requires patient and staff attendance, but is time-constrained in an environment unlike the patient\\u2019s own surroundings. Wearables offer an exciting possibility for patient-directed data collection that better reflects real-life day-to-day variations in heart rate and physical activity12. In this study, a neural network that was self-training was designed to provide value from the vast amount of information collected by wearables, and address key issues such as inconsistent and missing data. The performance of the wearable neural network was not dependent on clinical factors, and for prediction of future NYHA class was equivalent to (but not better than) conventional parameters such as a 12-lead ECG and 6MW testing. F1 scores >0.5 indicate an acceptable balance between precision and recall, and the wearable model score of 0.56 was significantly better than chance (in this case, 0.35). Further development, testing and validation of these approaches is clearly required. Of note, the trial recruited older patients (mean age 76\\u2009years, range up to 90\\u2009years) who indicated the use of wearables was appealing to monitor and improve their own functional capacity.Several studies have utilized wearable devices in cardiovascular research. The Apple smartwatch and Fitbit studies used photoplethysmography to identify new AF13,14, and there are many different devices being used across heart failure to quantify patient physiology15. Early optimism has already started to fade somewhat, and one retrospective matched study in the US found that patients using wearable devices accessed more healthcare but with no difference in heart rate16. It remains to be seen how these consumer-bought, nonmedical devices will be integrated into routine care, with or without the acceptance of healthcare professionals1,17. Further randomized trials are needed to understand whether continuous monitoring can provide a personalized assessment of treatment response, or help to identify subphenotypes of disease. Similarly, approaches to transparent and validated artificial intelligence (AI) remain in their infancy18. AI has demonstrated an ability to go beyond our current linear understanding of disease trajectory and interactions, with the ability to personalize diagnostic and therapeutic strategies even in multimorbid conditions19,20. Despite the potential benefits of AI, broader use in clinical practice requires an approach guided by strong methodological principles6.AF is a key public health issue, predicted to double in prevalence over the next few decades21. Recent evidence suggests that cognitive decline and vascular dementia should be added to the list of adverse events suffered by patients with AF22,23. New technologies have rapidly increased our ability to detect AF, but how these should be implemented in clinical practice remains unclear9. Despite permanent AF being the most common \\u2018type\\u2019 of AF24, there is a remarkable lack of research to support decision-making and improve patient quality of life7,25,26,27. Treatment choices for heart rate control are often made based on evidence from heart failure trials; however, the reduction in mortality from beta-blockers was not evident in double-blind trials in patients with heart failure and concomitant AF28. Digoxin has traditionally been reserved for sicker patients or as a second-line agent. Similar to beta-blockers, there is no apparent mortality impact from digoxin in patients with AF and heart failure, and observational analyses are wholly inappropriate to evaluate outcomes with digoxin because of systematic prescription biases29,30. The RATE-AF trial was a head-to-head randomized trial of digoxin and beta-blockers, showing that digoxin had a similar impact on patient-report quality life as beta-blockers yet substantially improved functional class. Use of digoxin led to a significant reduction in natriuretic peptides, and fewer than half the number of primary care and unplanned hospital visits10. This study now adds a further dimension, showing that low-dose digoxin can be an effective rate control agent. The effect on heart rate and physical activity was consistent with the longer-term activity of digoxin, including pro-parasympathetic effects on cellular, electrophysiological and neurohormonal pathways8.Although the number of patients was limited and did not encompass all participants in RATE-AF, this study included a large volume of wearable data and was able to benefit from being embedded in a randomized trial to limit extraneous bias. The wearables were implemented post randomization and hence there is a risk of residual confounding; however, there was no crossover use of digoxin10, analysis was by intention-to-treat and reasonable balance in clinical characteristics between groups was maintained for those patients joining the wearable study. As expected, actual usage of wearable devices among participants had considerable variation. There is a known motivational and behavioral impact from wearables, although when asked at final follow-up, the same proportion in each randomized group indicated improved motivation for physical activity: 16 patients (59.3%) in the digoxin group and 13 (54.2%) in the beta-blocker group (P for comparison\\u2009=\\u20090.71). Use in an older population brought challenges, with many participants not previously owning a smartphone; however, good compliance and data quality were achieved. Missing data points were frequent, but their impact was minimized by using an innovative approach to embed machine learning on the significance of missing data, rather than ignore or impute it. Although subgroup analysis according to activity levels found no difference in heart rate between digoxin and beta-blockers, the use of digoxin in high-activity settings remains largely untested. Diversity in ethnicity was limited (white British or Irish ethnicity accounted for 94% of participants), and so these results cannot be extrapolated to other ethnicity groups. Although technology advances can improve human health, it remains important to ensure that deployment of such devices does not exacerbate health inequalities.In summary, a wrist-worn consumer-grade wearable device and smartphone were successfully deployed within a randomized controlled trial of older, multimorbid patients to evaluate continuous, ambulatory heart rate and physical activity. Including an average of two to three million data points per patient, including at rest and exertion, digoxin and beta-blocker therapy had similar effects on heart rate measured over a 20-week period. A neural network model of wearable sensor data showed similar performance for predicting future health status as conventional measures used in clinical trials.MethodsThe RATE-AF trialThe RATE-AF trial was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial that compared the use of low-dose digoxin versus beta-blockers for long-term heart rate control7. Recruitment took place across primary care sites and three hospitals in the West Midlands region of England between 2016 and 2018. Inclusion criteria were: (1) age 60\\u2009years or older; (2) permanent AF in need of rate control; and (3) symptoms of heart failure, with breathlessness equivalent to NYHA class II or above. Exclusion criteria were limited so that the trial population reflected routine clinical practice (see published protocol for full list of selection criteria)10.Ethics and inclusion statementThe trial was co-designed by a patient and public involvement (PPI) team, with the aim of improving quality of life for patients with AF11,27. Ethical approval was obtained from the East Midlands\\u2013Derby Research Ethics Committee (16/EM/0178), the Health Research Authority (IRAS 191437) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The trial was publicly funded by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (CDF-2015-08-074) and registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02391337) and clinicaltrialsregister.eu (2015-005043-13).Randomization and trial processEach participant was randomized to either digoxin 62.5\\u2013250\\u2009\\u00b5g or bisoprolol 1.25\\u201310\\u2009mg once daily in a 1:1 ratio at their baseline visit. Randomization was completed using a computer-generated minimization algorithm to ensure treatment arms were balanced for gender and AF symptoms, based on the mEHRA classification.The trial was embedded into usual care within the National Health Service (NHS), with participants attending formal visits at baseline, 6\\u2009months and 12\\u2009months. Endpoints acquired were patient-reported quality of life, NT-proBNP, symptoms and functional capacity using mEHRA and NYHA class, 6MW distance and time, heart rate (pulse examination), 12-lead ECG, LVEF using cardiac ultrasound and assessment of adverse events.Wearables substudyFunding for the wearables substudy was obtained after the main trial had commenced from the European Union Innovative Medicines Initiative BigData@Heart program (grant no. 116074). The study was supported by the Application of Artificial Intelligence to Routine Healthcare Data to Benefit Patients with Cardiovascular Disease (cardAIc) team at the University of Birmingham and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust. An amendment was made to the trial protocol and subsequently approved by the Research Ethics Committee. One of the original stated aims of the substudy was to correlate wearable sensor data with patient quality of life using the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36). Following work led by the PPI team that showed SF-36 to be as suboptimal measure of assessment27, this was subsequently changed to NYHA class in the statistical analysis plan completed before data analysis (Supplementary Note).Participants with at least 2\\u2009months remaining in the RATE-AF trial were considered eligible for inclusion in the substudy. All participants were provided with a specific patient information leaflet written by the PPI team, and were asked to sign an optional form to indicate informed consent. As an exploratory analysis, no sample size calculation was performed in advance of recruitment. Heart rate sensor data from the first 5\\u2009weeks in the first ten participants was used to estimate the minimum number of participants needed. The average weekly heart rate, s.d. and correlation of repeated measures from this data indicated that a sample size of 40 participants would provide 90% power over 20\\u2009weeks to detect a 1/3\\u2009s.d. difference in heart rate (2\\u2009bpm) between digoxin and beta-blockers (control 72\\u2009bpm; s.d. 6\\u2009bpm; repeated measures correlation 0.91; two-sided alpha 0.05). A minimum target of 50 enrolled participants would account for death and loss to follow-up during the substudy.Consenting individuals were given a Samsung A6 Android smartphone (with a prepaid mobile data contract) and wrist-worn Fitbit Charge 2 wearable device for passive monitoring. There were no exclusions related to age or previous proficiency with information technology. Applications were preinstalled and set up for remote data collection, providing active monitoring and an educational resource for patients, including the European Society of Cardiology smartphone application (app) specifically designed for patients with AF31. Participants were shown how to charge and carry out basic functions on each device, and how to use the apps. They were instructed to carry the phone throughout the day and to wear the wrist device continuously, only removing it for showering, bathing, swimming or charging. After the set-up appointment, in-person or telephone follow-up was provided after the first week, after 4\\u2009weeks and ad hoc to maintain engagement and address any concerns or technical issues raised by participants.Data collection and storageData collected via the device and smartphone was encrypted and uploaded to a secure server, temporarily cached on the smartphone until an appropriate Wi-Fi or mobile data connection was available. The collection of wearable data streams was automated using the RADAR-base platform, funded by the European Union Innovative Medicines Initiative RADAR-CNS (grant no. 115902)32. This platform allows for secure streaming of data from wearables, apps and devices to a central location. For this study, the RADAR-base platform was installed on a virtual machine hosted by Amazon Web Services in the Europe (London) region and was maintained by the Hyve (IT company, Netherlands). By applying for Fitbit developer application, the RADAR-base platform automatically collected data from registered participants, who were also able to see their own heart rate and step counts. For clinical data storage, secure electronic case report forms were generated using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system hosted by the University of Birmingham, and the main trial case report forms hosted by the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit.Statistical analysisData were analyzed by intention-to-treat according to the randomized allocation (digoxin versus beta-blockers), with no imputation for any missing data. Continuous measurements of heart rate and step count were pooled at 1-min intervals to form time-series data (heart rate averaged over each minute; step counts summed over each minute), with the primary analysis over a prespecified period of the first 20\\u2009weeks of device use. The results were summarized and presented as a number, percentage, mean and s.d. or standard error of the mean, or median with i.q.r. The Kruskal\\u2013Wallis nonparametric test or a t-test were used to determine differences between the two treatment arms depending on normality, and Spearman\\u2019s test was used to quantify correlations. To account for multiple repeated measurements of heart rate over time in individual participants, generalized linear models were generated using a random-effects estimator and exchangeable correlation matrix. A post-hoc subgroup analysis according to activity levels was based on US Centers for Disease Control recommended activity levels (minimum 150\\u2009min per week aerobic activity equivalent to 15,000 steps per week, and health benefits goal of 300\\u2009min per week aerobic activity equivalent to 30,000\\u2009steps per week). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata v.17 (StataCorp LP), with a two-tailed P-value <0.05 denoting statistical significance.Neural networkMachine learning algorithms were generated to explore whether continuous sensor data were comparable with conventional periodic trial measurements at the closest RATE-AF trial appointment, developed according to our previously published AI framework6. Unlabeled wearable sensor data from staggered 4-h periods were used to develop a self-supervising CNN (Extended Data Fig. 2). The self-supervising model was motivated by the principle that important information is carried not only in the heart rate and step count channels, but also in the temporal interaction between those channels. To learn this interaction, an auxiliary dataset was synthesized from a training set of the original sensor data where the heart rates and step counts of each sample were scrambled across patients and dissociated. For example, a multichannel sample might include the heart rate time-series of patient A, but the step count time-series of patient B. The auxiliary dataset was combined with the original data to create a classification problem: to discriminate whether a given sample came from the original or scrambled data. Because the original data have temporal interdependencies between the channels, and the scrambled data do not, it is believed that learning this objective is equivalent to learning the relationship between those sensor channels.Heart rate measures were standardized to z-scores; step counts were normalized to the range [0,1] because of frequent and meaningful measurements of zero (inactivity). Both were defined with respect to each participant\\u2019s individual statistics\\u2014a heart rate z-score of 0 indicates the mean average heart rate for that patient. Small amounts of missing data were present throughout the recordings: these may have been short periods in which participants were not wearing their devices, or where data was not received because of connectivity issues. This missing data was neither dropped nor imputed, but used as a third time-series channel alongside heart rate and step count. This allowed the model to learn the significance of missing data instead of making assumptions about its distribution.Multichannel time-series data were the input for a one-dimensional convolutional layer of 8 filters and a kernel size of 21 (minutes), followed by a one-dimensional max pooling layer of size and stride 2. After pooling are two further convolutional layers with 20 and 32 filters, each with kernel size 21. Finally, one-dimensional global average pooling was performed to reduce the data representation to a vector of length 32. During training, dropout (with probability\\u2009=\\u20090.5) was applied to this layer to improve regularization. Finally, the prediction is made by a fully connected layer comprising a single sigmoid unit. Every layer but the last used rectified linear unit activation, and the network was trained to minimize binary cross-entropy using an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 3\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910\\u22124 and L2 regularization with weight 1\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910\\u22128 applied to each nonbias parameter. After training the network to convergence, the dropout and classification layers were removed from the model, and the output of the final convolutional layer was used as a 32-dimensional embedding vector representing the time-series data used as input.Because the objective of this model was to predict the patient\\u2019s future NYHA class, it was evaluated by embedding data from each patient\\u2019s first week, and using that embedding to predict their NYHA class at the end of trial as the outcome of interest. This self-supervised model was trained using all data for each patient other than in this first week, while also holding out a subset of patients as a validation set to monitor under- or overfitting during model training. The hold-out set comprised 20% of the patient group, repeated across five iterations with k-fold cross-validation. For this exploratory analysis, participants were only included if they had available nonmissing time windows in the first and subsequent 19\\u2009weeks, and reached the final follow-up assessment for NYHA class. Models were compared for prediction of NYHA class at the end of the trial (5\\u2009months later): a conventional logistic regression model including ECG heart rate and 6MW test results (distance traveled, time taken and participant speed), and the wearable sensor model using CNN latent time-series embeddings from wearable sensor data as input features with L2 norm regularization (as used in ridge regression).We prespecified evaluation of models using the F1 score\\u2014a metric combining precision and recall that ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect accuracy for classification. For each model, label smoothing was used over the NYHA class targets as a further method of regularization. The 95% CI was estimated by bootstrap resampling. During the peer review process, a post-hoc analysis was added to calculate the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for each model, which provides an aggregate measure of classification performance with values ranging from 0 to 1 (higher indicates better performance). Machine learning analyses were performed using Python (Python Software Foundation) with scikit-learn, and TensorFlow (Google Brain).Role of the funding sourcesNone of the organizations providing funding had any role in the design or conduct of the study (including collection, analysis and interpretation of the data) or any involvement in preparation, review or approval of the manuscript.Reporting frameworksThe study is reported according to the Minimum Information about Clinical Artificial Intelligence Modeling (MI-CLAIM) checklist33.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\\n\\n\\nData availability\\nSummary anonymized wearable sensor data are available for noncommercial purposes on request to the corresponding author (d.kotecha@bham.ac.uk; 60\\u2009days response time for decisions).

S1 denotes start of sensor data collection. S2 denotes sensor data used for validation. Time-point 2 (t2) is the future for New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class prediction. Lower panel: The convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture uses dilated convolution and max-pool layers to capture long-term structure. Global average pooling is used to reduce spatial extent to fixed-length vector representation. Dropout and L2 penalty are applied to avoid overfitting to training set and label smoothing is used for faster learning. The final layer is binary sigmoid for data discrimination task. The penultimate layer of 32 units is used as latent space features for regression modeling.Extended Data Table 1 Baseline characteristics of patients that declined participationFull size tableExtended Data Table 2 Usage of devices at interim reviewFull size tableExtended Data Table 3 Wearable sensor parameters over sequential weeksFull size tableExtended Data Table 4 Change in NYHA classificationFull size tableSupplementary informationSupplementary InformationStatistical and AI analysis plan addendum.Reporting SummaryRights and permissions\\nOpen Access  This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

Meta have focused more attention on wearable products \\u2013 hoping to capture customer enthusiasm, as well as new revenue.\\nNew watches, earbuds, headsets and even rings offer some of the most interesting developments, especially in terms of health and fitness features. Tech expert Omar Gallaga says the big players are competing hard to get their devices into the hands of consumers.\\nHighlights from this segment:\\n\\u2013 Samsung\\u2019s new smartwatch and earbuds, announced this week, seem designed to compete directly with high-end products from Apple. Samsung boasts that it offers advanced sleep and health features not available to Apple Watch users.\\n\\u2013 Facebook parent company Meta has had success with Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. CEO Mark Zuckerberg told an interviewer recently that the company would announce enhanced versions soon, and that it\\u2019s working on a neural wristband that could react to hand and arm movements through a person\\u2019s nerves.\\n\\u2013 Apple is rumored to be working on a version of its AirPods earbuds that would include infrared cameras.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you found the reporting above valuable, please consider making a donation to support it\\u00a0here.

Consumer wearable devices, which monitor heart rate and physical activity (PA) via a wristband connected smartphone, can provide clinically valuable data for comparing the efficacy of digoxin (Digox; Concordia Pharmaceuticals) versus beta-blockers in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF), according to a study published in Nature Medicine. The findings support the potential of utilizing wearable technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to continuously monitor treatment responses, measure disease severity, and provide timely clinical information for patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD).The findings highlight the potential of consumer-wearable devices as an alternative, dynamic method for monitoring patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Image Credit: \\u00a9 Jacob Lund - stock.adobe.comCVD is the leading cause of death in the US, accounting for approximately 928,741 deaths in 2020, and encompasses various other related conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, such as HF and AF. HF occurs when the heart is not pumping well enough to meet the body\\u2019s needs for blood and oxygen, leading to the buildup of fluid in the lungs. This may lead to symptoms like shortness of breath, persistent coughing, or rapid or irregular heartbeat. HF has strong associations with AF, the most common type of heart arrythmia characterized by the heart beating too fast, slow, or irregularly. The conditions are considered bidirectional, meaning one can contribute to the development or worsening of the other.1-4Treatment for patients with HF and AF often includes medications to help improve the function of the heart, control blood pressure, or reduce cholesterol; however, surgery to repair the heart or implant a device to support the heart\\u2019s function may be recommended for patients with greater disease severity. Patients may struggle to adhere to their treatment plans due to the time-consuming clinical visits and the high costs associated with the treatment. Additionally, clinicians can receive limited functional data demonstrating a patient\\u2019s health status at individual appointments. Utilizing consumer-wearable devices gives providers the ability to continuously monitor patients\\u2019 health metrics, allowing them to provide more personalized treatment plans and respond more promptly to shifts in disease severity.3,5In the study, the researchers hypothesized that wearable devices can (1) identify whether digoxin is inferior to beta-blockers for long-term heart rate control in patients with AF at rest and on exertion, (2) improve ability to adjust for differences in PA, and (3) explore whether data collected from wearable devices are comparable with conventional methods for predicting treatment progress. They performed statistical analyses to compare heart rates between participants receiving digoxin and participants receiving beta-blockers based on reported results from the RATE-AF trial (NCT02391337). Using a convolutional neural network, they analyzed the wearable device data and predicted New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class.5,6The study involved 53 older, multimorbid patients (mean age 75.6\\u2009years [s.d. 8.4], 40% women) with permanent AF and HF who were randomized to receive either digoxin or beta-blockers. The researchers successfully collected over 140 million data points for heart rate and PA intervals and found there was no significant difference in heart rate between participants receiving digoxin compared with those treated with beta-blockers. Additionally, data collected from wearable devices were comparable to standard clinical measures of electrocardiographic heart rate and 6-minute walk test (F1 score 0.56 [95% CI 0.41 to 0.70] versus (0.55 [95% CI 0.41 to 0.68]) and can predict NYHA functional class.5The findings highlight the potential of consumer-wearable devices as an alternative, dynamic method for monitoring patients with HR and AF, potentially replacing or supplementing in-person clinical assessments and enhancing the timeliness and quality of care for patients.\\u201cHeart conditions such as [AF] and HF are expected to double in prevalence over the next few decades, leading to a large burden on patients as well as substantial healthcare cost,\\u201d said Professor Dipak Kotecha, MBChB, PCAP, MSc, FRCP, FESC, FHEA, professor of cardiology at the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences at the University of Birmingham, and lead study author, in a press release. \\u201cThis study is an exciting showcase for how artificial intelligence can support new ways to help treat patients better.\\u201d7REFERENCESPalliative care strategies can improve the management of cardiovascular disease.

His writing has appeared in publications such as CNN.com, PC World, InfoWord, and many others.\\n\\n\\n\\nlifewire's editorial guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\nPublished on July 15, 2024\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\nRelease Date Rumors\\nPre-Order Information\\nPrice Rumors\\nFeatures\\nLatest News\\n Apple may be working on a small wearable device that projects audio beams at the user's ears to let them hear audio without headphones. News of this device came in a patent filing granted to the company in May 2024. This article explains what the patent covers, what the product might be, and what we know about it.\\n\\n\\n  What Is the Apple Wearable Device With Direct Audio Release Date?  \\n There's not a lot to go on about this device, just the patent\\u2014and not all patents lead to products. In fact, Apple and other tech companies receive hundreds and thousands of patents every year, and not all of that technology makes it to market.\\n\\n\\n Given that there are no rumors of an actual product using this technology, it's too early to know a release date for this unnamed device (if it gets released at all).\\n\\n\\nLifewire's Release Date Estimate\\nWe don't expect to see this direct audio device until late 2025 or 2026 (or maybe even later).\\n  Pre-Order Information  \\n Given that there aren't even rumors of a product here, there's no pre-order information to share right now. We'll update this article if that changes.\\n\\n\\n  Apple Wearable Device With Direct Audio Price Rumors  \\n The rumor mill doesn't have anything to say about prices for an Apple wearable with direct audio. If and when such a product is released, we expect it would cost at least as much as AirPods Pro ($249). It wouldn't surprise us if the price tag were higher.\\n\\n\\n  Apple Wearable Device With Direct Audio Features  \\n Apple's patent for this wearable computing device (Patent #US 11979721 B2) describes a gadget that can be worn on clothes and contains a set of speakers and microphones. The speakers beam audio to the wearer's ears, while the microphones take voice commands (probably to Apple's digital assistant, Siri).\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Apple, Inc / USPTO\\n\\n It's not hard to imagine that this device could be a next-generation AirPods product. It also brings to mind wearable computers like the Humane AI pin. While that particular product hasn't succeeded, the concept of a wearable device with a next-generation interface could likely crop up more in the coming years.\\n\\n\\n While we don't know much about this potential product yet, the patent describes two key features:\\n\\n\\n Directional audioMicrophones for commands, user identification, and calibration.\\n\\n\\n  Directional Audio  \\n The patent discusses an array of parametric speakers that send sound beams to the wearer's ears (this is called directional audio).\\n\\n\\n By making these beams of sound small and focused, the user can hear audio from the device without other people nearby\\u2014even people within a foot or two of the wearer\\u2014picking it up. That means the user doesn't need to wear earbuds or headphones to listen to music or make phone calls.\\n\\n\\n Directional audio using parametric speakers may sound futuristic, but it already exists in a few products.\\n\\n\\n  Microphones for Commands, User Identification, and Callibration  \\n The patented device would also contain microphones. These could be used for commands with a virtual assistant like Apple Intelligence or Siri.\\n\\n\\n The patent also mentions user identification\\u2014presumably the device would get to know your voice and maybe even use it as a password (the HomePod does something similar with Personal Requests)\\u2014and calibration (likely to gauge background noise and vocal volume to attune the device to the user and its surroundings).\\n\\n\\n  The Latest News About the Apple Wearable Device With Direct Audio  \\n Lifewire delivers all the latest news and opinions about ear buds and other wearable devices.

Smart rings are all the buzz. Don't believe me? Believe Samsung. It's the first leading tech brand to release a smart ring of its own, the Galaxy Ring, at its Galaxy Unpacked July 2024\\u00a0event. While the Galaxy Ring is something to be excited about, there are plenty of smart rings already on the market that are worthy of your consideration if you're interested in trying out the novel tech.Also:\\u00a0Here's everything we know about the Samsung Galaxy RingSmart rings track everything a smartwatch does, like sleep, activity, and wellness, all around your finger and without a screen. Plus, they tend to have longer battery life than smartwatches, so you spend less time charging and more time wearing them.While Oura used to dominate the smart ring space, brands ranging from newer startups to established companies are throwing their hat -- or rather, their ring -- in the ring. It's never been a more exciting time to put one of these new, high-tech rings on your finger.Also:\\u00a0The best fitness ringsThe best smart rings, like smartwatches, house a comprehensive suite of\\u00a0health\\u00a0and\\u00a0sleep-tracking\\u00a0features. They also take a more discreet approach. Some options even include NFC features like\\u00a0contactless payment\\u00a0and virtual business card functionality.\\u00a0What's the best smart ring right now?\\u00a0At ZDNET, we've gone hands-on with several of the top smart rings, spending weeks or months wearing them to test out how their apps, battery life, and other features perform. Our tested pick for the best smart ring overall is the\\u00a0Oura Ring 3, thanks to its lightweight fit, quick charging abilities, and impressive health suite. Read on to learn more about the perks of the Oura and which other top smart rings are worth considering.The best smart rings of 2024  Oura Ring Gen3 Best smart ring overall    Nina Raemont/ZDNET  Pros & Cons  Pros  Lightweight and natural fit  Quickly charges  Data syncing with Natural Cycles, Strava, and many other apps  Operates in Airplane mode Cons  Recurring $6/month membership  No half-sizes More Details  I've been wearing an Oura Ring on my finger for a few months now, and have used the ring in nearly every environment: while running in the city, working at the office, stretching on a yoga mat, and sleeping in my bed. Oura presents my sleep, activity, and recovery data to me right as I check the home page on the app, and I'm pleased with how it's helped me further understand myself through health data. It even captured my higher stress levels on one tear-filled night.Additionally, the simplified overall score appears with a detailed chart monitoring heart rate, body temperature, and blood oxygen levels through the night. The ring also automatically senses when you're stressed and adjusts your activity goals accordingly. One recent night, it detected my significantly raised body temperature and suggested I use the rest mode function, which deprioritizes activity and prioritizes rest and recovery.\\u00a0There are many reasons to opt for Oura, but one that comes up in conversations a lot is how many apps partner with Oura. Natural Cycles, Strava, and more health apps offer data syncing into the app. I love that when I use Strava for runs, it automatically shows up in my Oura timeline.\\u00a0ZDNET contributor Sherin Shibu purchased a Heritage\\u00a0Oura Ring\\u00a0and tested it with weekly activities like strength training, cycling, yoga, and more. She reported that not only was it a capable and accurate tracker, but it didn't overwhelm her with data. Instead, the Oura Ring prioritized actionable insights and solutions. For example, the over 50 guided meditation options have helped Shibu to alleviate stress and sleep more soundly, she wrote in her review.\\u00a0This comprehensive but simple approach is evident in the ring's form factor and integrations -- Shibu said she was amazed at how such a sleek device could hold such a catalog of information. The ring syncs with Apple Health, Google Fit, and iOS and Android apps, allowing you to see your daily and even monthly metrics from your mobile device.\\u00a0The downside, which Redditors and reviewers often point out, is that there's a $6 per month membership cost to unlock personal insights, like in-depth morning sleep analysis and temperature trend monitoring (which can even predict early stages of illness). Non-paying members only have access to sleep, readiness, and activity insights.Thankfully, Oura's customer service is great. ZDNET staff writer Allison Murray called them after her ring's battery began to falter, and the company sent her another ring free of charge.\\u00a0Also:\\u00a0The Oura smart ring's brilliant new features outshine even its titanium finishOura Ring Gen3 tech specs: Material: Lightweight titanium with non-allergenic, non-metallic inner molding |\\u00a0Battery life: 4 to 7 days |\\u00a0Charging:\\u00a0Full charge in 20 to 80 minutes |\\u00a0Compatibility:\\u00a0iOS and Android |\\u00a0Durability:\\u00a0Water-resistant up to 328 feet |\\u00a0Sizing:\\u00a0Free sizing kit with purchase on their site   View now at Oura RingView now at Amazon  more buying choices   Ultrahuman Ring Air Best subscription-free smart ring    Nina Raemont/ZDNET  Pros & Cons  Pros  Extremely comfortable to wear  Great for athletes or fitness junkies  AI-powered data and insights are actually helpful  Syncs with Strava  Subscription-free Cons  Ring heats up after charging  App's user interface could be improved More Details  If you're all in on tracking your macros and micros, counting your steps, training for your next marathon, guided workouts, and more, then there's no better smart ring for you than the Ultrahuman Ring Air. This ring is designed for fitness enthusiasts who want to optimize their body's power for mental and physical energy throughout the day. From the moment you wake up until the minute you fall asleep, Ultrahuman offers you insights into how to get the most out of your day, through reminders on when to consume caffeine, expose yourself to sunlight, get up and walk, and wind down.I've been testing the Ultrahuman Ring Air, and I love the way the app presents data in a digestible way and offers specific insights all on the home page that I don't have to search for. I also like that it gives me at-a-glance health data on the homepage, like body temperature, heart rate data, and which phase of my menstrual cycle I am in, and how I can maximize these phases for energy or rest. Plus, Ultrahuman just got a major feature upgrade. You can now sync your Strava data onto the Ultrahuman app, which is ideal for runners, bikers, and avid walkers who use the popular fitness app.\\u00a0The ring is as discreet and comfortable as can be, and unlike the Oura Ring, which seemingly gets scuffed and scratched when in contact with any abrasive material, the Ultrahuman Ring Air has maintained its matte sheen -- and I can't detect a single mark on it so far.\\u00a0Of course, because this is a newer smart ring brand, the ring isn't without its flaws. Redditors have reported lower HRV data and other tracking flukes that the company has addressed through continual software updates.Notably,   founder Mohit Kumar is quite active on reviews pages and seemingly attentive to customer feedback and support. I'd say this is the closest competitor to Oura in the smart ring space so far, and if you're looking for a subscription-free smart ring with up-to-snuff data tracking, battery life, and other helpful features, Ultrahuman Ring Air is your best bet. \\u00a0Review: The best ring for fitness junkies beats the Oura in 4 waysUltrahuman Ring Air specs: Sizing:\\u00a05-14 |\\u00a0Material:\\u00a0Titanium coated with Tungsten Carbide Carbon |\\u00a0Colors: Matte grey, Aster black, space silver, bionic gold\\u00a0|\\u00a0Water resistance:\\u00a0Up to 330 feet |\\u00a0Sensors: Infrared Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, Non-contact medical-grade skin temperature sensor, 6-axis motion sensors, Red LEDs (heart rate monitoring and oxygen saturation) Green LEDs (heart rate monitoring) Infrared LEDs (heart rate monitoring) |\\u00a0Connectivity:\\u00a0Bluetooth Low-Energy |\\u00a0Battery:\\u00a0Up to six days   View now at Amazon    Samsung Galaxy Ring Best smart ring for Android users    Kerry Wan/ZDNET  Pros & Cons  Pros  No subscription  New double-pinch feature  Seven-day battery Cons  iPhone users can't access More Details  Let me introduce you to the newest smart ring in the game and the first smart ring released by a leading tech brand. The Samsung Galaxy Ring was released in July, and it's a wearable any Android user -- that's right, no iOS compatibility on this ring -- could get excited about.\\u00a0The Galaxy Ring is similar to many of the smart rings on this list in terms of features and functions, with a few fun exceptions. Like other rings, you're getting sleep and activity tracking. The Galaxy Ring uses an AI algorithm to determine your sleep quality, patterns, and more, and offers up a sleep score every morning that sums up your night's sleep. There's snoring analysis, movement during sleep, sleep latency, and heart and respiratory rate tracking.Also:\\u00a0Samsung Galaxy Ring hands-on: I asked for 4 features and they delivered on all of themAll this data is collected and stored through the Samsung Health app, which Android users can access (and Apple users... can't). This also means that iPhone users can't use the Galaxy Ring with their phone, unless they make the Android switch.Another benefit of having the Galaxy Ring within the Samsung ecosystem is that you can record workouts on a Samsung Galaxy smartwatch and log your sleep on the smart ring, then have all your data stored together. You can still use the ring for activity logging too, as Samsung offers features to support activity, like energy scores, inactive alerts, and automatic workout detection.\\u00a0One new feature that's novel to the smart ring space (and the rings on this list) is the double pinch gesture you can perform with the ring on your pointer finger. This feature snoozes alarms and snaps photos, all through the pinch of your fingers.Given how new the product is, we haven't had the chance to test this ring extensively yet, so wait for our full review in the coming weeks and months. Even before the review comes out, though, we predict that the ring could become one of the major players in the smart ring space.Galaxy Ring tech specs: Material:\\u00a0Titanium |\\u00a0Battery life: Seven days |\\u00a0Sizing:\\u00a05 to 13 |\\u00a0Compatibility:\\u00a0Android: |\\u00a0Durability:\\u00a010ATM waterproof rating\\u00a0|\\u00a0Charging:\\u00a0Charging case   View now at AmazonView now at Best Buy  more buying choices   RingConn Smart Ring Best Oura Ring alternative    Matthew Miller/ZDNET  Pros & Cons  Pros  Long battery life  Helpful and extensive data Cons  No readiness score  No sharing with third-party apps besides Apple Health More Details  The RingConn Smart Ring is a great option for people looking for two things: 1) A ring that includes many of the great features of the Oura or Evie Ring like heart rate, SPO2, and sleep tracking, but is available for men, women, and nonbinary folks, and 2) A ring that does not require an additional monthly subscription fee. All you have to pay for with the RingConn Smart Ring is the up-front $279 cost, and then nothing else. (Again, the Oura Ring requires a $6 a month membership fee on top of the cost of the ring itself.)\\u00a0\\\"I was much more impressed with the\\u00a0RingConn Smart Ring\\u00a0than I expected to be,\\\" ZDNET contributor Matthew Miller wrote\\u00a0in his review\\u00a0of the ring. \\\"I'm close to switching to it as my primary smart ring [from the Oura Ring] because I like the extensive amount of data provided and the ability to easily swap smartphones that I connect to the ring.\\\" Redditors agree that the extent of data tracking on RingConn's smart ring is some of the most impressive in the smart ring space.\\u00a0Alongside the long, seven-day battery life of the ring, the charging case also offers up a 500 mAh battery that can power your ring for up to 150 days.RingConn Smart Ring tech specs: Material:\\u00a0Titanium |\\u00a0Battery life: Seven days |\\u00a0Sizing:\\u00a06 to 14\\u00a0|\\u00a0Compatibility:\\u00a0iOS and Android: |\\u00a0Durability:\\u00a0IP68 waterproof rating\\u00a0|\\u00a0Charging:\\u00a0Charging case   View now at RingConn    Amazfit Helio Ring Best smart ring with smartwatch compatibility    Matthew Miller/ZDNET  Pros & Cons  Pros  Great for sleep tracking  Comfortable to wear to wear  Pairs with Amazfit smart watches for full health data compatibility Cons  Only available in two sizes  Some inaccurate health data, like resting heart rate and readiness scores  Have to pay more for full data access More Details  Smartwatches and smart rings serve different purposes. Smartwatches tend to perform better for activity tracking, while smart rings excel at sleep tracking. If you want both a smartwatch and a smart ring, I'd recommend buying the Amazfit Helio Ring, the only smart ring that also boasts smartwatch compatibility, to have all your fitness data and sleep data in one place.\\u00a0This ring isn't perfect for everything, as ZDNET's Matt Miller writes in his review, but it's great for sleep tracking. The sleep tracking includes a readiness score, a sleep score, sleep resting heart rate, sleep heart rate variability (HRV), and recovery time. A further breakdown of your sleep, including time and percent in deep and REM sleep, appears on the sleep tab of the Zepp app.\\u00a0When Miller wore the Helio Ring, he compared the data to the Oura Ring and Polar watch and found that the Helio Ring's sleep score, sleep duration metrics, and HRV, all aligned with the two other wearables. \\\"However, the time in each sleep stage, resting heart rate (RHR), and readiness scores ended up looking quite different,\\\" Miller wrote.\\u00a0Also:\\u00a0Amazfit Helio Ring review\\u00a0One drawback to this ring is that you'll need to pay extra to get access to all your data, like weekly or monthly reports, readiness insights, or Zepp AI Coach details. Also, the ring is only available in two sizes right now (10 and 12), but Amazfit plans to roll out more sizes in the future.\\u00a0Amazfit Helio Ring specs: Material:\\u00a0Titanium |\\u00a0Battery life: Four days |\\u00a0Sizing:\\u00a010 and 12 | Sensors: PPG heart rate sensor, temperature sensor, EDA sensor\\u00a0|\\u00a0Compatibility:\\u00a0iOS and Android | Waterproof\\u00a0rating: Water resistance 10 ATM\\u00a0   View now at Amazfit    Evie Ring Best affordable smart ring    Nina Raemont/ZDNET  Pros & Cons  Pros  Specifically for women  Comprehensive mood and symptom logging features  Tracks menstrual cycle, sleep, and activity Cons  Only available on iOS app  Only available for women  Weaker battery life More Details  Every other ring on this list has a starting price of around $300. The Evie Ring only costs $270, without any additional subscription. What you gain in affordability, though, you lose out on in terms of useful health data features, but if you're new to the wearables space and are looking to dip your toes into smart rings, that won't be a problem with this ring.\\u00a0This is an entry-level smart ring designed for women who are looking to monitor their menstrual cycle and wellness through activity and sleep tracking features, as well as mood and symptom logging. \\\"The symptom-logging feature is competitive and thoughtful, and it helps you to understand the ebbs and flows of your moods throughout your menstrual cycle. Each day you can log your energy level and mood level, tag certain adjectives like 'calm,' 'depressed,' 'anxious,' and more, document your menstrual flow and your symptoms, and add tags like whether you drank alcohol, are sick, or are working through an injury,\\\" I wrote in my review.\\u00a0Also: Evie Ring reviewThrough continual documentation of mood logging, you can understand how your mood fluctuates with your menstrual cycle, activity, sleep, and more. Evie seems to offer a well-rounded view of health that relies on not only data but also works with you to understand the \\\"why\\\" behind your data.\\u00a0One downside of the Evie Ring is the fact that it's for women only, and the Evie app is only available through the iOS store, so Android users can't get it right now. Another downside is that the battery life is not as competitive as other smart rings, and many features aren't accessible while the ring's battery is low.\\u00a0Movano Evie Ring\\u00a0specs: Sizing:\\u00a05 to 11\\u00a0|\\u00a0Material:\\u00a0Liquid metal\\u00a0|\\u00a0Colors: Silver, rose gold, gold\\u00a0|\\u00a0Water resistance:\\u00a0Up to 1 meter\\u00a0|\\u00a0Sensors: Heart rate, heart rate variability, SpO\\u2082, skin temperature, and active metabolic calorie burn |\\u00a0Connectivity:\\u00a0Bluetooth\\u00a0|\\u00a0Battery:\\u00a0Around four days   View now at Evie Ring  ZDNET contributor Sherin Shibu contributed to this story.  What is the best smart ring?      I recommend the Oura Ring 3 as the best smart ring based on its extensive capabilities. However, there are other great choices out there, too. This table compares the best smart rings based on price, battery life, and materials.Smart ringPriceBattery lifeMaterialOura Ring 3$2994-7 daysTitanium with non-allergenic interiorUltrahuman Ring Air$349Up to six daysTitaniumSamsung Galaxy Ring$399Up to seven daysTitanium  RingConn Smart Ring$229Up to seven daysTitaniumAmazfit Helio Ring$300Up to four daysTitanium with non-allergenic interiorEvie Ring$269Up to four daysLiquid metal*Lowest price at the time of writing. Please note that prices may vary based on retailer and available promotions, sales, or discounts.     Which is the right smart ring for you?      It depends on your needs and your budget. For example, if you want a smart ring that will help you optimize your fitness routine, the Ultrahuman Ring Air is your best bet. Or, if you want the most durable option, the titanium body of the Oura Ring 3 will keep up with your wildest adventures. Below, our table helps you determine the right ring for you based on specific uses:\\u00a0Choose this smart ring...If you want...Oura Ring 3The best smart ring overall with a titanium body, full charging in 20 to 80 minutes, and automatic firmware updates. Health tracking is accurate and comprehensive without overwhelming you with data, and the company rolls out new features every month. A subscription is required.\\u00a0Ultrahuman Ring AirThe best smart ring for fitness junkies who want to optimize every part of their day with data on activity, sleep, recovery, and more. No subscription attached.\\u00a0Samsung Galaxy RingThe best smart ring for Android users with impressive AI-powered sleep algorithms, activity monitoring, and a double pinch gesture for taking photos and snoozing alarms. It's the most expensive upfront cost, but you don't have to pay for a subscription, unlike a few options on this list.\\u00a0RingConn Smart RingAn alternative to the Oura and the Evie Ring with sleep, stress, and activity features and weekly, monthly, and yearly trend reports for easy data viewing. No subscription is required.\\u00a0Amazfit Helio RingThe only smart ring on this list with smartwatch compatibility. You can pair the ring to your Amazfit smartwatch and have all your fitness and sleep data in the same place. The ring functions as a great sleep tracker, but as a first gen product, has some kinks to figure out. You have to pay extra to get all your health data information.Evie RingThe best smart ring for women looking to connect their regular health, fitness, and sleep data with data on their ovulation and menstrual cycle. It's a more affordable and subscription-free but less competitive option on this list.     Factors to consider when choosing a smart ring      If you're interested in purchasing a smart ring, you should consider the following factors:\\u00a0Purpose and functionality: Traditionally, smart rings like the Oura Ring are a substitute for a smartwatch or other health tracking device. For this list, we considered rings that monitor factors like blood oxygen testing, sleep and heart rate tracking, and activity metrics, but also considered rings with smart nuances, such as NFC readings and making contactless payments.\\u00a0Durability: To go from jewelry accessory to smart staple, there are certain durability aspects these rings should include to maximize benefits. We considered if the rings were waterproof, water-resistant, or coated with any extra protection.Device compatibility: Unlike a smartwatch, smart rings don't have an interactive display. Therefore, all the data is housed via third-party software. We made sure these choices were compatible with iOS and Android.Design: One of the benefits of a smart ring is that, ideally, it's sleek, subtle, and comfortable to wear -- even as your finger may swell in the summer heat.     How we test smart rings      ZDNET went hands-on with every smart ring on this list. We spend a few weeks or months wearing the rings to test out how their apps, battery life, and other relevant features perform -- not just for a day or two, but over the course of many wears and through different environmental conditions. When we think a product is worth your money, we put it on this list and write up a spotlight highlighting its best qualities and specifying who it's for.\\u00a0Also: How we test smart rings at ZDNETPlus, we are constantly scouring the web for new products that are worthy of testing, and following news on product rollouts and upgrades. We know buying an expensive smart ring can set you back a few hundred dollars, and that's why our advice is tailored to your needs and budget and our picks are expert-vetted.\\u00a0To learn more about my process for testing smart rings, visit this article, which covers it in depth.\\u00a0     Which is the best fitness ring?      Other ZDNET experts also assessed the Oura Ring 3 as the best overall smart ring in the fitness wearable market, especially if your goal is to specifically track exercise and workout recovery. If you aren't interested in the monthly subscription that comes with an Oura Ring, a great alternative fitness ring is the Ultrahuman Ring Air, which, in my opinion, is a sleeper hit fitness ring for anybody who wants to track their diet, get reminders and insights to maximize their energy levels throughout the day, and follow guided workouts, all on the app. This is in tandem with the already amazing health data you get on the Ultrahuman app.\\u00a0     Can the Oura Ring tell if you're sick?      Yes, by measuring heart rate variability (HRV), the Oura Ring 3 has also proven to show early signs of sickness. Wake Forest University's Dr. Jason Fanning, for example, told ZDNET that he saw that his \\\"heart rate variability went through the floor\\\" thanks to his Oura Ring data, days before he tested positive for COVID-19.\\u00a0     Are smart rings reliable?      Smart rings can provide more accurate readings than smartwatches because they are worn close to large blood vessels located in the fingers. In contrast, smartwatch sensors utilize small capillaries for readings.\\u00a0     What can a smart ring do?      Smart rings can be useful for a variety of functions. A ring like the McLear RingPay is ideal if contactless payments are your top priority. If you want 24/7 monitoring of your blood oxygen and heart rate, go with the Circular Ring. Smart rings can go as far as you need, and you can even program your own with the Hecere NFC Ring.Smart rings also tend to have long battery lives, while some don't require charging at all.     How much do smart rings cost?      Smart rings vary in price, depending on their features and which finish you get your ring in. A matte black smart ring is going to cost much less than a rose gold smart ring. On average, a smart ring will cost you around $250 to $450, depending on the finish and features.\\u00a0     How long do smart rings last?      Despite how small smart rings are, their battery life can compete with, say, smartwatches. Look for a smart ring that can last up to four to seven days while you're shopping around. If you are paying around $300 for a smart ring, it should last you at least four days, but ideally five or six. The more you have to charge this ring, the less you'll want to wear it and reap the benefits of the health data tracking suite.\\u00a0     Are there alternative smart rings worth considering?      There are various smart rings on the market that didn't make the cut for my top five. However, I've included a few other smart rings that receive honorable mentions:   View at AmazonView at SleeponView at AmazonZDNET Recommends    \\n\\n          The best smartwatches you can buy: Apple, Samsung, Google, and more compared\\n         \\n\\n          The 5 best VPN services (and tips to choose the right one for you)\\n         \\n\\n          The best Android phones you can buy (including a surprise pick)\\n         \\n\\n          The best robot vacuum and mop combos (and if they're worth the money)\\n            \\n\\n            The best smartwatches you can buy: Apple, Samsung, Google, and more compared\\n           \\n\\n            The 5 best VPN services (and tips to choose the right one for you)\\n           \\n\\n            The best Android phones you can buy (including a surprise pick)\\n           \\n\\n            The best robot vacuum and mop combos (and if they're worth the money)\\n           Editorial standards  Show Comments  \\n          Log In to Comment\\n         Community Guidelines     Related   \\n      Samsung Galaxy Ring vs. Oura Ring: Which wearable should you buy?\\n      \\n      The best fitness rings you can buy: Expert tested\\n      \\n      Samsung Galaxy Ring hands-on: Why I'd ditch my Oura for this competing wearable\\n              ZDNET we equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.

AP Photo\\u2014Yuki IwamuraSAN FRANCISCO (AP) \\u2014 Samsung is dressing up its wearable devices in technology\\u2019s latest fashion \\u2014 artificial intelligence.\\nThe South Korean electronics giant on Wednesday revealed that both its first-ever premium smartwatch and a smart ring heralding its entry into a niche market will include AI features that are supposed to help people monitor and manage their health.\\nBoth the Galaxy Watch Ultra, priced at $650, and the Galaxy Ring, priced at $400, are extensions of\\u00a0a push that Samsung launched six months ago\\u00a0when it introduced its first smartphones to feature AI technology as a main attraction. The high-end smartwatch costs twice as much as Samsung\\u2019s latest standard model, the Galaxy Watch 7, which will sell for $300.\\nTethering AI to people\\u2019s essential devices has become an accelerating trend. The technology already has been implanted on smartphones made by\\u00a0Google\\u00a0and\\u00a0Apple\\u00a0that compete against Samsung and also on the latest personal computers powered by Microsoft\\u2019s Windows software.\\nThe AI deployment on Samsung\\u2019s new premium watch and ring is narrowly focused on improving and maintaining personal health \\u2014 the main reason most people buy wearable technology.\\nBoth Samsung\\u2019s watch and ring are leaning on AI to do a better job of analyzing biometric data collected from the person wearing the devices to customize assessments of their well-being through an \\u201cenergy score\\u201d that will deliver ratings on a one to 100 scale and also make recommendations like a virtual fitness coach.\\nJust as Apple plans to do with its AI services, Samsung\\u2019s new wearable products will collect most sensitive information on the devices themselves. But some data will still be processed through remote computing centers with a \\u201cdefense-grade, multi-layer security platform\\u201d that Samsung likens to a virtual Fort Knox, echoing Apple\\u2019s pledge to corral any personal information that must be processed off a device in a digital fortress. But those promises don\\u2019t necessarily guarantee there won\\u2019t ever be security breaches or other breakdowns that unintentionally exposes personal information to outsiders.\\nSamsung\\u2019s premium phone is the more sophisticated of its latest wearable devices, capable of performing some functions \\u2014 such as flagging sleep apnea \\u2014 that the Galaxy Ring can\\u2019t. However, the ring requires less frequent recharging, equipped with a battery that can last six to seven days before needing to be replenished.\\nBut the smartwatch is also in a much more crowded market currently led by Apple, which has been intensifying its focus on health features since entering the market a decade ago. More than 60 million people already use the Samsung Health app that works in tandem with its smartwatches.\\nThe health benefits associated with wearable technology have helped spur more people to buy smartwatches, with worldwide sales of the devices expected to approach about $29 billion this year, based on a forecast by the research firm Gartner Inc. That translates to roughly 164 million new smartwatches being worn on wrists this year, with Gartner predicting the annual sales volume sold will rise to 195 million in 2028.\\nSamsung is likely to face more challenges in the smart ring market, even though it won\\u2019t be facing much competition so far. The segment so far has been shaped by startups such as Oura and RingConn that haven\\u2019t made a significant dent so far.\\n\\u201cSmart rings are still an emerging category with no exclusive use cases, with little expectations of growing beyond a niche market\\u201d through 2028, Gartner said in its recent overview of the wearable technology market.\\nThe firm expects a small segment that includes smart rings to generate $2.4 billion in sales this year and eventually rise to about $4.6 billion in 2028.\\nAlthough it will come in nine different sizes, Samsung\\u2019s Galaxy Ring only fits with one kind of software \\u2014 Google\\u2019s Android operating system. That locks out the mostly affluent consumers who own iPhones and often are interested in checking out new forms of technology such as the Galaxy Ring.\\nSamsung also is rolling out its latest attempt to lure more people into buying a foldable phone equipped with two display screens that can be hinged together so the device can be turned into a pseudo-tablet. It\\u2019s a concept that Samsung has pushing since 2019 with minimal success, but the company is continuing to update the device with camera and AI features to feed the niche market. The next-generation model, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, will sell for $1,900.\\nMeanwhile, unionized workers in South Korea declared an\\u00a0indefinite strike\\u00a0to pressure Samsung to accept their calls for higher pays and other benefits. Thousands of members of the National Samsung Electronics Union launched a temporary, three-day strike on Monday. But the union said Wednesday that it was announcing an indefinite strike, accusing the management of being unwilling to negotiate.\\nSamsung claims there have been no disruptions to production.Recommended Newsletter:\\r\\n\\r\\nCEO Daily provides key context for the news leaders need to know from across the world of business.

High-tech footwear and a versatile vest comprise the recently introduced products. The footwear, which Nike describes as \\\"wearable and mobile,\\\" is equipped with heat and dynamic air-compression massage capabilities for the feet and ankles. A system of dual-air Normatec bladders, which are incorporated with warming elements, is employed in these boots to ensure that the upper portion of the boots is evenly heated. Nike clarified that this combination is intended to \\\"drive heat deep into the muscle and tissue in the foot and ankle, helping athletes move, perform and recover naturally much faster.\\\" The battery cell, which is situated in the insole of each shoe, regulates the three levels of compression and heat that the boots provide. Athletes can choose to control the heat and compression of both shoes simultaneously with a single button or adjust each shoe individually.\\nThe collaborative vest utilizes thermoelectric coolers to deliver immediate heating and cooling capabilities without requiring ice or liquid. According to Nike, this feature enables athletes to \\\"dial their body temperatures to their exact specifications during warm-ups and cool-downs.\\\" Hyperice, a company renowned for its innovative recuperation technology, contributes its expertise to this partnership, supplementing Nike's product line with state-of-the-art thermal and compression technology. This collaboration represents a substantial advancement in the development of recovery solutions and optimal athletic performance.\\nBecome a Subscriber\\nPlease purchase a subscription to continue reading this article.\\nSubscribe Now\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\njirehl  \\n \\nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Companies \\n\\nPfizer Struggles with Employee Morale Amid Business Turnaround \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n Companies \\n\\nDuPont to Acquire Donatelle Plastics, Enhancing Healthcare Capabilities \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n Features \\n\\nAI\\u2019s Role in Addressing Healthcare\\u2019s Data Challenges \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Features \\n\\nWarren Buffett Donates Record $5.3 Billion in Berkshire Hathaway Shares \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n Companies \\n\\nSimplify Healthcare and Capgemini Collaborate to Enhance Payer Efficiency \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n Features \\n\\nSmarter Data Regulation Needed to Prevent Misuse \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Biotech \\n\\nJ.P.

Our Experts Explain\\n\\n                    Jul 12, 2024\\n                    Jeremy Deutchman\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSince ancient Greece, patient history and physical examination have been the cornerstone of medicine. Yet, this information is not always detailed in the electronic health record (EHR), nor does the EHR consistently offer more objective real-time data. These gaps can impair actionable intelligence when it comes to making treatment decisions.\\nWearable monitoring devices represent a revolution in information capture, transforming outcomes for orthopedic patients and others. Discoveries sat down with Joseph Schwab, MD, MS, the director of both Spine Oncology for Orthopaedic Surgery and the Center for Surgical Innovation and Engineering at Cedars-Sinai; and Hamid Ghaednia, PhD, co-director of the Center for Surgical Innovation and Engineering, to discuss the promise of wearable technology in improving patient care and quality of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are wearable monitoring devices in the context of orthopedic care?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoseph Schwab, MD, MS: Most of us are already familiar with wearables, such as phones or watches, that track our motion. But those have limitations. We\\u2019re designing advanced technologies that use machine-learning algorithms to give us less subjective data we can incorporate into the EHR. We want to get a better picture of what may be happening with individual patients\\u2019 musculoskeletal and neuromuscular health.\\nHamid Ghaednia, PhD: The majority of wearables use motion tracking or accelerometers. The challenge with current motion-tracking systems is that they give us an indirect measurement of muscle activity. These systems make lots of general assumptions about human bodies, even though every body is different. Those assumptions get baked into the resulting data. Our center is focused on direct measurement of muscle movement\\u2014wearables that will give us quantitative insights about patients\\u2019 progress and changes in clinical conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWearables have tremendous potential to open up a whole new era in our understanding of muscle physiology.\\u201d\\n\\u2014 Dr. Joseph Schwab\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow would this data complement the other information physicians are trying to capture in the EHR?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJS: One thing lacking in clinical medicine right now is a real-time understanding of our neuromuscular system. Patient history and physical exam\\u2014along with data from MRI, ultrasound and muscle biopsy\\u2014are critical, but they\\u2019re static and don\\u2019t tell us much about what\\u2019s happening during real-time activity. Wearables have tremendous potential to open up a whole new era in our understanding of muscle physiology.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can this intelligence benefit patients?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHG: Dr. Schwab started using artificial intelligence to predict mortality of the spinal column 15 years ago, when no one was implementing these kinds of decision-support systems. As a result, now we can predict mortality of spine oncology patients, which empowers us to make better and more objective decisions. Four years ago, we decided to take this to a new level by integrating machine learning with novel devices and wearables. When we focus on wearables as one critical component of a more systematic approach to patient care, we see remarkable leaps forward in our diagnostic and treatment abilities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy is Cedars-Sinai the ideal place for this work?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJS: Cedars-Sinai is a top-flight research institution that matches its world-class clinical reputation. Worldwide, there are very few centers developing wearables and biomedical devices within a hospital setting, which makes this place truly unique.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTags:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                          Innovation\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                          Orthopaedic Research\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                          Technology\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                          discoveries\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                          Featured\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    Blog & Magazines\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncatalyst\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       Blog & Magazines Home\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nCS-Blog\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       Blog\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nCS Magazine\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       Cedars-Sinai Magazine\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\ndiscoveries magazine\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       Discoveries Magazine\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nEmbracing our Community\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       Embracing Our Community\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       Catalyst\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       International\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Blog & Magazines\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ncatalyst\\n\\n          \\n          \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        Blog & Magazines Home  \\n \\nCS-Blog\\n\\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        Blog  \\n \\nEmbracing our Community\\n\\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        Embracing Our Community  \\n \\nCS Magazine\\nCedars-Sinai Magazine  \\n \\ndiscoveries magazine\\n\\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        Discoveries Magazine  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    Popular Topics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Patients\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                            Scientists\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                            Innovations\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Quick Reads\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                            Weird Science\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    Make an Appointment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n            \\n                Find a Doctor\\n            \\n            \\n           \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n            \\n                Schedule a Callback\\n            \\n            \\n           \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    Call Us 7 Days a Week, 6 am - 9 pm PT\\n\\n\\n\\n1-800-CEDARS-1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    Support Cedars-Sinai\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n            \\n                MAKE A GIFT\\n            \\n            \\n           \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n            \\n                VOLUNTEER\\n            \\n            \\n           \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Why Wearables?

Photo: SamsungShanghai resident and long-time iPhone user Jiang Jiayi, 30, said he is among those mainland consumers considering to buy the Galaxy Ring.\\u201cIt\\u2019s a lighter-weight option for health tracking, and I\\u2019m quite curious to know up to what degree it can replace smartwatches [for that purpose],\\u201d he said.Samsung set the price of its smart ring on the mainland at 3,099 yuan (US$425), according to Chinese media. The company, however, labelled the gadget as \\u201cout of stock\\u201d on its China website as of Thursday afternoon.Some mainland consumers have already complained about the Galaxy Ring\\u2019s price. \\u201cIt looks pretty cool,\\u201d wrote Weibo user \\u201cqzc\\u201d in a post on the Chinese microblogging platform on Thursday.\\u201cBut I\\u2019ll only consider [buying such a product] if any domestic company follows up [with a smart ring of its own].\\u201dBefore the Galaxy Ring\\u2019s launch, Chinese consumers have shown interest in smart rings from some smaller vendors such as Oura, Ultrahuman and RingConn.A sustained local demand for the Galaxy Ring would count as a success for Samsung on the mainland, where it once was the biggest smartphone vendor with a 20 per cent market share in 2013.The Korean firm ranked dead last among the market\\u2019s major handset vendors by 2018, with just a 1 per cent share, and has since remained around that level.Samsung Electronics launched its latest portfolio of smart wearable devices on July 10. These include the Galaxy Ring in three colour options, the Galaxy Watch7 (centre) and the Galaxy Watch Ultra. Photo: SamsungIn spite of its shrunken presence in China, Samsung has continued to launch new smartphone models on the mainland, as it remains keen to stage a comeback.Samsung has been working with some Chinese Big Tech companies, including Baidu and Tencent Holdings, to help step up localisation of its smartphones\\u2019 content ecosystem.Samsung\\u2019s latest product launch is expected to help \\u201cfoster consumer habits\\u201d in the nascent smart ring market, with the potential to widen market penetration, according to a research note by TF Securities on Wednesday.Still, it remains to be seen whether the Galaxy Ring can establish a leading position in its category or be surpassed by the competition.Apple has accelerated the development of its own smart ring and registered patents related to this device, according to a report by Korean media ETNews in February. Apple has yet to make an announcement on this new wearables segment.Chinese smartphone vendor Honor, a Huawei spin-off, also revealed in February that it was developing a smart ring after Samsung announced initial details about the Galaxy Ring during the MWC Barcelona trade show that same month.1\",\n        \"type\": \"Document\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"lc\": 1,\n      \"type\": \"constructor\",\n      \"id\": [\n        \"langchain\",\n        \"schema\",\n        \"document\",\n        \"Document\"\n      ],\n      \"kwargs\": {\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"source\": \"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-preorder-the-samsung-galaxy-ring-2024-7\",\n          \"title\": \"How to Preorder the Samsung Galaxy Ring, a New Wearable Health-Tracker\",\n          \"description\": \"The Samsung Galaxy Ring is available to preorder as of July 10, 2024, and will officially release on July 24.

Whether you're a rusted-on Pebble early adopter, a park runner with a Garmin, or simply someone curious about the Apple Watch, wearable technology has caught the attention of millions of Americans.\\nThose who have completed an online Masters in Counseling Psychology can appreciate how difficult it can be to untwist the relationship between tech fans and tech addicts\\u2014but what if I were to tell you that wearable tech is helping to drive a new generation of medical research?\\u00a0\\nConsider this\\u2014a device on your hand monitoring your blood pressure, sleeping patterns, and general oxygen levels. In a new study conducted by researchers at the University of Vermont, data from wearables is used to help understand the relationship between sleep and stress. Could wearables enable a brand new generation of medical research?\\nAn Era of Nighttime Disturbances\\nTechnology is something that's all around us. From mobile devices to computers, wearable devices, and increasing numbers of IoT (Internet of Things) items, Americans have more ways than ever before to put off the sleep gremlins and stay attached to their technology for just a little longer.\\nRecent data suggests that as many as nine in ten Americans use some form of technology in the hour before bed\\u2014with research from the National Sleep Foundation indicating that young people were more likely to use stimulating communications devices, such as smartphones, rather than passive devices, such as listening to music on a speaker.\\nThere's an inherent problem with stimulating technology usage\\u2014particularly in the bedroom, where people are meant to rest and recharge after a busy day. When going to bed, your body needs to be able to wind down and relax\\u2014easy to do with few distractive stimulants in play, but much harder if your most recent actions were stimulating the mind and body through elements such as screen lighting and sounds.\\nIn a world where wearing technology is becoming increasingly commonplace, understanding what can be done to provide high-quality sleep frequently is essential. It's well documented that a lack of sleep or poor-quality sleep can lead to increased stress on the immune system\\u2014harming your body's ability to fight against infection and disease. Additionally, a lack of sleep can also increase the risks of contracting conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, conditions that adversely affect the lives of millions of Americans each year.\\nFrom Bicycle Computers to Modern Wearables\\nTo understand how modern wearables came to be, we should first consider how professional athletes can operate at optimal performance. While it's somewhat straightforward to view the recordings of an event and provide feedback, having quantifiable data can help coaches provide detailed feedback on how an athlete's body is physically reacting during an event.\\nIn 1981, the first commercial heart rate monitors became available to purchase, manufactured by Finnish sports instruments company, Polar. These heart rate monitors allowed for data to be collated and gathered while a user was wearing the watch\\u2014allowing for the analysis of cardiac output. This was particularly useful for runners, who sought to understand how their bodies were performing\\u2014whether slowing down or speeding up slightly could impact their performance during a race.\\nAround the same time, a similar innovation came to the cycling industry, with cycle computers that provided speed, distance and time traveled also hitting the market in the 1980s. Over time, it was recognized that with increasingly powerful and miniaturized computers, more and more data could be collated by devices such as heart rate monitors and cycle computers alike.\\nThe late 2000s and 2010s saw a rapid emergence in modern wearables that could gather increasing amounts of health data. Companies such as Fitbit and Garmin came onto the market with digital sensors embedded in watches that could not only provide heart rate data but also track steps, sleep trends, and other critical healthcare data.\\n(Photo : Fabian Albert on Unsplash)\\nTracking Stress During Sleep\\nIn a recent study published in PLOS Digital Health, researchers from the University of Vermont investigated the data produced by a brand of healthcare wearable to identify whether stress levels could be determined simply by using data from a wearable device.\\nIn the longitudinal study, more than 700 college students had healthcare data collated using data from a device known as an Oura ring. Datapoints collected included temperature, heart rate, nightly sleep duration, and breathing rate. Additional surveys were used to collect more subjective responses about emotions and stressors.\\nResults from the survey were promising\\u2014with data suggesting that wearable devices may be helpful in pre-emptively identifying which students may get the most benefit out of college mental health services.\\nOne area of the data that was most interesting was the identification of health trends when comparing young women who identified as stressed. Interestingly, data looking at female participants in the research noted two distinct heart rate curves among women\\u2014notably, those who identified that they were experiencing anxiety or depression were finding it much harder to sleep than those who were not as stressed.\\nNew Opportunities for Wearable Research\\nWhat other opportunities exist in the field of wearable research? As it turns out, the advent of modern, connected activity trackers provides a wealth of opportunities for researchers to understand healthcare data at a population-wide level.\\nTake, for example, heart conditions that are difficult to spot, such as arrhythmia, also known as atrial fibrillation. At a wider level, data can be collated and compared, helping to highlight patients who may have unusual heart rates\\u2014and to urgently flag data if something goes wrong, such as when author Adam Croft woke up in the middle of the night with his Apple Watch informing him that his heart was in atrial fibrillation.\\nAdvancements in the size and variety of healthcare data will hopefully mean that researchers may be able to further develop cohort research into wearable users. Perhaps the next generation of wearables will not only provide valuable healthcare data to end users\\u2014but maybe even save a few lives while doing so.\\n\\n                \\u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

But, seeing that Samsung also makes an array of watches, the team has gone the extra mile to make its wearables work together, and actually designed the Galaxy Ring to work holistically with the Galaxy Watch.\\u00a0I had the chance to chat with Drew Blackard, VP of Mobile Product Management at Samsung Electronics America, at a Galaxy Unpacked Event in NYC, and while rocking both a Galaxy Ring and a Galaxy Watch might be for the \\u201csuper enthusiast\\u201d at first, there are some other reasons for it like sleep tracking.\\u00a0(Image credit: Future / Matt Evans)\\u201cI don\\u2019t like to sleep with a watch, but I\\u2019ve been sleeping with the ring and it\\u2019s super comfortable,\\u201d noted Blackard. And that\\u2019s a common trope of folks who want metrics on sleep but also don\\u2019t find it comfortable to wear a smartwatch on their wrist overnight. Plus, there\\u2019s always the chance it could buzz or glow and wake you.Prime Day deals are here - shop our expert picksMaybe even more important, though, is a battery life benefit that Blackard described: \\u201cIf you\\u2019re wearing the two together, the devices can intelligently determine which sensors to use in the ring to offset some of the power consumption. So you may actually get more battery life out of the ring if you\\u2019re wearing both at the same time.\\u201dThat\\u2019s a potential big win, and Samsung noted that you can save up to 30% power on the Ring or a Watch, since it\\u2019s deciding which sensors it needs on and which device is most accurate. Blackard expanded that since you have multiple reads from potential sensors on your wrist and on your finger, \\u201con-device intelligence can determine how to balance those readings and get you a more accurate step count, heart rate, among other things.\\u201d(Image credit: Future)The level of intelligence between both devices is impressive and does create some unique experiences. We\\u2019ll be testing them as we go hands-on, but it could be a step up for accuracy, considering that Samsung might opt to use the Ring over the Watch or vice-versa.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.It also speaks to Samsung\\u2019s unique entry into the smart-ring space, as they already have experience with wearable devices. They expect some folks to pair a Galaxy Ring with an existing smartwatch, or potentially the Galaxy Watch 7 or Ultra and want to deliver a compelling experience.Between the promised higher level of accuracy for certain metrics and up to 30% better battery life, Samsung hopes these are two additional reasons to choose the Galaxy Ring over competitors like the Oura Ring or the Ultrahuman.In the meantime, you can read our hands-on with the Galaxy Ring here and TechRadar\\u2019s Editor At Large Lance Ulanoff's interview with Samsung\\u2019s Dr. Hon Pak here.You Might Also LikeHands on: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review \\u2013 tougher, smarter ...Samsung Galaxy AI compatibility explained: which phones have ...Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: price, release date, features and ...\\n\\nJacob KrolSocial Links NavigationUS Managing Editor NewsJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

But the holy grail is probably getting it right for blood pressure monitoring without a cuff, because raised blood pressure is the leading cause of death in the world [1]. Many have tried and failed, but industry is persisting: numerous devices are on the market, several different technologies have been developed, hundreds of patents are registered every year [2], and some devices already have regulatory approval [3]. However, to convince the die-hard blood pressure critic is a different ball game.Cuffless blood pressure devices rely on a range of different technologies to estimate blood pressure changes, with most using pulse transit time with ECG, or pulse wave analysis combined with proprietary algorithms (and often artificial intelligence)\\u2014relying mostly on an initial calibration with a cuff. Other potential technologies include facial video processing or ultrasound, which may not require calibration with a cuff [2]. Technical challenges with devices may include their accuracy, stability of the measurements post calibration, and how machine learning technology is implemented\\u2014in other words, how reliant the algorithm is on hemodynamic components and other demographic inputs, such as sex and age [2].Although authorities such as the American Heart Association [4] and European Society of Hypertension [2] recognise the major potential of cuffless blood pressure monitoring, both have published statements against their use in clinical practice due to accuracy issues, and uncertainty regarding their usefulness in clinical practice. The question is not so much whether a cuffless wearable device can produce a blood pressure comparable to a cuff device\\u2014since this has been proven relatively easy to do\\u2014but rather whether cuffless wearables can track blood pressure when calm, sleeping and excited [5].At the same time, we have to admit that blood pressure is a very challenging physiological measure. It changes from second-to-second, day-and-night, and during winter-and-summer, when we are calm or excited [6]. Even our \\u2018gold standard\\u2019 method for diagnosing hypertension, cuff-based 24-h blood pressure monitoring, has poor intra-individual reproducibility across two different days [7].From a clinical perspective it is understandable that for cuffless blood pressure monitoring to be accepted, there needs to be convincing evidence that the device can track pressure in a similar fashion as (imperfect) 24-h cuff-based monitors. This is due to strong evidence that 24-h cuff blood pressure predicts death and cardiovascular events, with nighttime blood pressure being the most potent predictor of outcome [8,9,10]. If a cuffless device does not track cuff-based blood pressure, how would a clinician feel confident to make treatment decisions? For this reason, the European Society of Hypertension now recommends stringent criteria for cuffless device manufacturers to validate the accuracy of their products in tracking blood pressure [5]. These include procedures including six validation tests that were developed to evaluate different aspects of so-called \\u201cintermittent\\u201d cuffless devices: (1) a static test similar to validation tests used for cuff-based devices (absolute accuracy in blood pressure measurement); (2) a device position test (whether it captures changes in hydrostatic pressure); (3) medication treatment test (accuracy in tracking blood pressure lowering); (4) awake/asleep test over 24-h (tracking change in blood pressure); (5) exercise test (tracking blood pressure increases); (6) and the recalibration test (stability in cuff calibration blood pressure over time) [5].From a patient\\u2019s perspective, it is understandable that comfort is tops [11]. A wrist-band, patch or ring that does not disturb nighttime sleep or disrupt daily activities, or cause an anxiety response when the cuff inflates [12], would be much easier to wear for months, let alone 24\\u2009hours.Being a blood pressure critic myself, understanding the challenges of currently accepted methods and cuffless devices, I performed a 24-h blood pressure monitoring self-test. While not claiming a flawless study by any means (with an N\\u2009=\\u20091), it merely serves to demonstrate the challenges that we face. I monitored my own blood pressure while using five different devices simultaneously: cuff-based ambulatory monitoring (left and right arm) with two validated WatchBP O3 devices (MicroLife, Switzerland) [13], and three wearable cuffless devices: the Aktiia wrist-wearable (Aktiia SA, Switzerland) [14, 15], Biobeat chest patch (Biobeat Technologies, Israel) [16, 17], and the CAR-T ring (Skylabs, South Korea) [18, 19]. At the start of the 24-h period, the Aktiia device was calibrated using its own supplied upper-arm cuff. The Biobeat and CAR-T ring were calibrated according to device specifications using a validated iHealth Feel (iHealthlabs, USA) upper-arm blood pressure cuff. I then evaluated how well all devices tracked my blood pressure while I was awake, asleep and when watching the 2023 Rugby World Cup final on television (early morning in Sydney). Being an avid Springbok rugby fan, I anticipated a substantial blood pressure response. This is likely a good emotional stressor, since in New Zealand, a strong upswing in acute cardiac hospital admissions during Rugby World Cup tournaments were seen when the All Blacks participated [20].When reviewing the systolic blood pressure\\u00a0results (Fig.\\u00a01 Panel A), it is firstly clear that despite the two cuff-based devices inflating at precisely the same second, there were clear points of discrepancy while awake, asleep and during the rugby match. This may have been due to movement, body position or other factors. However, there were no statistical differences between average awake (p\\u2009=\\u20090.35), asleep (p\\u2009=\\u20090.88) or rugby (p\\u2009=\\u20090.35) blood pressure readings between the left and right arm devices. It is also relevant to mention that systolic blood pressure dipped from an average of 113\\u2009mmHg when awake, to 91\\u2009mmHg when asleep, rising to an average of 123\\u2009mmHg when watching the rugby. Since the blood pressure of the two cuff devices was not statistically different, they were combined and averaged for comparison with the three cuffless devices.Fig. 1: 24-H systolic blood pressure, while awake, asleep and while watching the Rugby World Cup Final.A Left vs right arm ambulatory cuffs; and average of left and right arm cuff blood pressure vs. B Aktiia wrist-worn device; C Biobeat chest patch; and D CAR-T ring.Full size imageThe Aktiia device (Fig.\\u00a01 Panel B) produced comparable systolic blood pressure when awake (p\\u2009=\\u20090.73) and during the rugby match (p\\u2009=\\u20090.54), but reported higher values when asleep (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). This finding aligns with our previous independent comparison study in 41 patients [21].The Biobeat patch device (Fig.\\u00a01 Panel C) produced lower systolic blood pressure when awake (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and during the rugby match (p\\u2009=\\u20090.005), and higher blood pressure when sleeping (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), suggesting strong reliance on the original calibration pressure.The CAR-T ring (Fig.\\u00a01 Panel D) showed lower systolic blood pressure when awake (p\\u2009=\\u20090.002), but was comparable when sleeping (p\\u2009=\\u20090.56) and when watching the rugby (p\\u2009=\\u20090.13).In Fig.\\u00a02, similar device comparisons are shown but for heart rate across the 24-h period. Overall, the cuffless devices tracked heart rate quite well compared to the heart rate recorded by the cuff devices.Fig. 2: 24-H heart rate, while awake, asleep and while watching the Rugby World Cup Final.A Left vs right arm ambulatory cuffs; and average of left and right arm cuff heart rate vs. B Aktiia wrist-worn device; C Biobeat chest patch; and D CAR-T ring.Full size imageThe comparisons above focus only on systolic blood pressure\\u00a0and heart rate, but it is important to also review performance in diastolic blood pressure. In Fig.\\u00a03 comparisons are presented in Panel A firstly showing no statistical differences between the left and right cuff-based devices for systolic, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. In Panel B the differences between the cuffless and cuff-based devices are shown for 24-h, awake, asleep and rugby match recordings, indicating for diastolic blood pressure, mainly overestimation of blood pressure by cuffless devices during the nighttime, but no statistical differences during awake or rugby recordings. Heart rate recordings were comparable between cuff-based devices and the Aktiia and BioBeat devices across the 24-h, but the CAR-T ring underestimated heart rate during the awake period (mean 78 vs 82 bpm).Fig. 3: Differences in average blood pressure and heart rate over 24 h using various blood pressure devices.A Differences between left and right arm cuff-based devices, and differences between cuffless and cuff-based devices for B systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate.Full size imageIt is clear from the figures that each device type has its own features that may require highlighting.\\n\\nWhere the cuff-based ambulatory devices were programmed to take readings every 20\\u2009min, the cuffless devices are usually programmed to only take a reading when the person is not moving. How would this influence \\u2018true\\u2019 blood pressure? Since it is known that a cuff inflation causes an anxiety response [12], would that mean that cuff-based ambulatory blood pressure should be higher overall than cuffless measurements?\\n\\n\\nAlso, although the data presented here were generated from current cuffless devices, the companies continuously strive to improve software algorithms, and therefore often launch updates of their mobile device applications. Hence, improved versions may already be available for some.\\n\\n\\nWhere a patient can usually only endure one 24-h cuff-based blood pressure measurement at a time, cuffless devices are used for weeks and months without the user being aware that readings are taken. The benefit of weeks or months\\u2019 worth of data compared to a single 24-h period, is perhaps underestimated.\\n\\n\\nThe number of readings taken by the different devices also varies substantially. For instance, during nighttime 16 cuff blood pressure readings were taken, 10 Aktiia readings, 10 Biobeat readings, and 58 CAR-T readings.\\n\\nWith blood pressure changing all the time, it is likely that when more readings are taken, it may be better than fewer. In fact, when reflecting on current clinical practice mostly relying on a single snapshot clinic\\u00a0blood pressure taken (often imprecisely) for decision-making [22], one cannot help but wondering whether it is time to completely overhaul how blood pressure is measured in primary care. Current blood pressure measurement practices across thousands of busy clinics is certainly not \\u2018good enough\\u2019\\u2014the question is when cuffless readings will be good enough?\\n\\n\\nReferencesGBD 2019 Risk Factors Collaborators.

The high-end smartwatch costs twice as much as Samsung's latest standard model, the Galaxy Watch 7, which will sell for $300.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTethering AI to people's essential devices has become an accelerating trend. The technology already has been implanted on smartphones made by Google and Apple that compete against Samsung and also on the latest personal computers powered by Microsoft's Windows software.The AI deployment on Samsung's new premium watch and ring is narrowly focused on improving and maintaining personal health \\u2014 the main reason most people buy wearable technology.Both Samsung's watch and ring are leaning on AI to do a better job of analyzing biometric data collected from the person wearing the devices to customize assessments of their well-being through an \\u201cenergy score\\u201d that will deliver ratings on a one to 100 scale and also make recommendations like a virtual fitness coach.Just as Apple plans to do with its AI services, Samsung's new wearable products will collect most sensitive information on the devices themselves. But some data will still be processed through remote computing centers with a \\u201cdefense-grade, multi-layer security platform\\u201d that Samsung likens to a virtual Fort Knox, echoing Apple's pledge to corral any personal information that must be processed off a device in a digital fortress. But those promises don't necessarily guarantee there won't ever be security breaches or other breakdowns that unintentionally exposes personal information to outsiders.Samsung's premium phone is the more sophisticated of its latest wearable devices, capable of performing some functions \\u2014 such as flagging sleep apnea \\u2014 that the Galaxy Ring can't. However, the ring requires less frequent recharging, equipped with a battery that can last six to seven days before needing to be replenished.But the smartwatch is also in a much more crowded market currently led by Apple, which has been intensifying its focus on health features since entering the market a decade ago. More than 60 million people already use the Samsung Health app that works in tandem with its smartwatches.The health benefits associated with wearable technology have helped spur more people to buy smartwatches, with worldwide sales of the devices expected to approach about $29 billion this year, based on a forecast by the research firm Gartner Inc. That translates to roughly 164 million new smartwatches being worn on wrists this year, with Gartner predicting the annual sales volume sold will rise to 195 million in 2028.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamsung is likely to face more challenges in the smart ring market, even though it won't be facing much competition so far. The segment so far has been shaped by startups such as Oura and RingConn that haven't made a significant dent so far.\\u201cSmart rings are still an emerging category with no exclusive use cases, with little expectations of growing beyond a niche market\\u201d through 2028, Gartner said in its recent overview of the wearable technology market.The firm expects a small segment that includes smart rings to generate $2.4 billion in sales this year and eventually rise to about $4.6 billion in 2028.Although it will come in nine different sizes, Samsung's Galaxy Ring only fits with one kind of software \\u2014 Google's Android operating system. That locks out the mostly affluent consumers who own iPhones and often are interested in checking out new forms of technology such as the Galaxy Ring.Samsung also is rolling out its latest attempt to lure more people into buying a foldable phone equipped with two display screens that can be hinged together so the device can be turned into a pseudo-tablet. It's a concept that Samsung has pushing since 2019 with minimal success, but the company is continuing to update the device with camera and AI features to feed the niche market. The next-generation model, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, will sell for $1,900.Meanwhile, unionized workers in South Korea declared an indefinite strike to pressure Samsung to accept their calls for higher pays and other benefits. Thousands of members of the National Samsung Electronics Union launched a temporary, three-day strike on Monday. But the union said Wednesday that it was announcing an indefinite strike, accusing the management of being unwilling to negotiate.Samsung claims there have been no disruptions to production.\\u2014-This story has been corrected to reflect the price for Samsung's standard watch starts at $300, instead of $350 as reported in a previously version.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

approves Liberty League to use in-game play calling technology from GoRout\\nLiberty League's seven teams will institute GoRout\\u2019s game system, GoRout Gridiron, across in-conference football games during the 2024-25 season.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBy Rob Schaefer\\n7.16.2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGoRout/Liberty League\\nAfter approving in-helmet radio devices for football competitions this spring, the NCAA\\u2019s experimentation with various methods of coach-to-player communication is expanding at the Division III level.\\n\\nThe Liberty League recently had a proposal of experimental use for in-game play calling technology provided by GoRout approved by the NCAA \\u2013 and will now have its seven teams institute GoRout\\u2019s game system, GoRout Gridiron, across in-conference football games (and out-of-conference matchups if their opponent consents) during the 2024-25 season.\\n\\nThis pilot will mark GoRout\\u2019s first go-around in live football competition, although its diamond sports product is used by more than 400 college baseball/softball teams and practice-focused football system, GoRout Scout, by multiple NFL clubs and big-name college programs including Alabama, Auburn and Rutgers.\\n\\nHere is how it works: from the sideline, coaches dictate play calls from a tablet, which beams instruction to wearable devices on athletes\\u2019 wrist or waistbands. GoRout Scout conveys those play calls through diagrams, while Gridiron displays simple text.\\n\\n\\u201cOur technology allows coaches \\u2013 during halftime, during periods after they go through a possession \\u2013 to make updates and adjustments to the text that\\u2019s being called and sent in,\\u201d GoRout CEO\\u00a0Mike Rolih told SBJ in a recent interview. \\u201c[Text is] not static, whereas an image is very difficult at that point to dry to redraw.\\u201d\\n\\nThat communication is encrypted, ensuring security in the cloud, and transmitted over 5G with an assist from Kore Wireless, GoRout\\u2019s networking partner. The wearables themselves can be flipped off at any time via the coach\\u2019s control panel and are layered with protective padding, ensuring security on the field.\\n\\n\\u201cWe spend a tremendous amount of time talking about security,\\u201d\\u00a0Rolih said. \\u201cA player would literally have to want to give the opponent to the opportunity to see the call [for signs to be stolen].\\u201d\\n\\n   1/2    Photo: GoRout    2/2    Photo: GoRout PREVIOUS NEXT\\nGoRout will provide each of the Liberty League\\u2019s schools with 10 wearable devices, two tablets and 24/7 technical support. That package\\u2019s pricing could range between $5,000 to $10,000 per year, GoRout chief partnerships officer Drew Robinson told SBJ.\\n\\n\\u201cThat\\u2019s a fairly wide window, but when you compare that to what we\\u2019ve heard some of the FBS teams are spending \\u2013 upwards of $100,000 \\u2013 on the helmet technologies and the audio technologies, this is going to be an attainable price point,\\u201d Robinson said, adding that GoRout\\u2019s system carries less liability consideration as altering game helmets as well.\\n\\nThat accessibility and visual dynamic is what separates GoRout from verbal communication methods.\\n\\n\\u201cThe kids that are coming up to play right now, and the coaches that are getting into coaching, most of them don\\u2019t communicate the way we used to communicate when we were growing up. They\\u2019ve never lived without a device in their hand,\\u201d Rolith said. \\u201cThis is a very natural communication methodology for them.\\u201d\\n\\nThe NCAA waiver allows three players on each team to wear a GoRout device per offensive or defensive snap, with no limit assigned for special teams plays. There also will not be a signal cutoff, such as in the NFL\\u2019s use of helmet radios, when communication is stymied with 15 seconds left on the play clock.\\n\\nGoRout will survey Liberty League coaches and athletes throughout the season to garner feedback on the technology to better understand how its system is being used and to inform product enhancements. \\u201cAll of our GoRout products are truly being built for coaches by coaches,\\u201d said Robinson, who served as a student assistant on Syracuse\\u2019s football coaching staff in the mid-2000\\u2019s and has worked in Rutgers, Syracuse and Western Michigan\\u2019s athletic departments.\\n\\nIn that vein, Liberty League commissioner Tracy King credited Union College coach Jon Drach, a member of the NCAA Football Rules Committee and GoRout Scout user during his time at Wilkes University, as catalyzing the relationship between the conference and vendor.\\n\\n\\u201cThe use of technology in sports, especially wearable technology is something that\\u2019s rapidly evolving,\\u201d King said. \\u201cWe felt this was an opportunity for us to be on the forefront of Division III.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPREVIOUS\\nReturn Home\\n\\n\\nNEXT\\nReturn Home\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSPONSORED CONTENT\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nADDITIONAL SECTIONS\\n\\nMedia\\nTech\\nExecutive Transactions\\nMarketing\\nInternational\\nData\\nFranchises\\nEsports\\nBetting\\nColleges\\nFacilities\\nEvents and Attractions\\nFinance\\nLabor and Agents\\nLeagues\\nOlympics\\nOpinion\\nPeople and Pop Culture\\nSports and Society\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPODCASTS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNBC\\u2019s Dan Hicks, Fox Sports\\u2019 Ben Valenta and NBA media rights deal nearing the finish line\\nJuly 17, 2024\\nOn the pod this week, with strong viewership in the books for both the Euros and Copa America, SBJ\\u2019s Austin Karp brings in Fox Sports SVP Ben Valenta to break down numbers around the \\u201cSummer of Soccer.\\u201d NBC's Dan Hicks joins us from the Open Championship at Royal Troon to talk golf, plus his upcoming assignment at the Paris Olympics alongside his longtime TV partner and swimming gold medalist Rowdy Gaines.

\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImage: A person walking in a state-of-the-art gait lab, with a wearable sensor positioned on his lower back (Photo courtesy of Tel Aviv University) \\n\\n\\nStep length is recognized as a sensitive and non-invasive metric for assessing a variety of conditions and diseases such as aging, neurological deterioration, neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive decline, and disorders like Alzheimer\\u2019s, Parkinson\\u2019s, and multiple sclerosis. Traditional devices used to measure step length, including camera-based systems and force-sensitive gait mats, are stationary, bulky, and typically confined to specialized clinics and laboratories. While these methods are accurate, they capture only a momentary glimpse of a person's walking ability, which may not accurately reflect their daily functioning. Daily walking patterns can vary with changes in a person\\u2019s fatigue, mood, and medication use. To address these limitations, researchers have developed a machine learning-based interdisciplinary model that accurately estimates step length and can be integrated into a wearable device attached to the lower back with tape, facilitating continuous step monitoring in everyday settings.\\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University (TAU, Tel Aviv, Israel\\u00a0and Ichilov\\u2019s Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Tel Aviv, Israell) overcame the limitations of existing step length measurement devices by utilizing IMU (inertial measurement unit) systems. These lightweight and relatively inexpensive sensors are already embedded in every smartphone and smartwatch and can measure walking-related parameters. Previous investigations into IMU-based wearable devices for step length assessment were conducted solely on healthy individuals without walking impairments, relied on small sample sizes that prevented generalization, and involved devices that were uncomfortable and often required multiple sensors. The goal was to create an effective, user-friendly solution suitable for individuals with mobility issues, including the elderly and those with medical conditions, enabling continuous, day-long data collection on step length within the patient's usual environment.\\nIn an article describing the research published on May 25, 2024, in the journal Digital Medicine, the team utilized IMU sensor-based gait data along with step length measurements previously gathered in a conventional setting from 472 individuals with various conditions, including Parkinson\\u2019s disease, mild cognitive impairment, healthy elderly individuals, younger healthy adults, and people with multiple sclerosis. A substantial and varied dataset of 83,569 steps was compiled from these participants. The researchers employed this dataset to train several machine learning models that convert IMU sensor data into accurate step length estimates. To assess the models\\u2019 effectiveness, they tested how well these models could generalize by evaluating their ability to accurately analyze new data not previously used in training, demonstrating the models' robustness in real-world settings.\\n\\u201cWe found that the model called XGBoost is the most accurate and is 3.5 times more accurate than the most advanced biomechanical model currently used to estimate step length,\\u201d said Assaf Zadka, a graduate student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at TAU, who led the research. \\u201cFor a single step, the average error of our model was 6 cm, compared to 21 cm predicted by the conventional model. When we evaluated an average of 10 steps, we arrived at an error of less than 5 cm, a threshold known in the professional literature as \\u2018the minimum difference that has clinical importance,\\u2019 which allows identifying a significant improvement or decrease in the subject\\u2019s condition. In other words, our model is robust and reliable, and can be used to analyze sensor data from subjects, some with walking difficulties, who were not included in the original training set.\\u201d\\nRelated Links:\\nTel Aviv University\\nTel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center\\n\\n\\n\\nVisit expo >\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGold Member \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tReal-Time Diagnostics Onscreen Viewer\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGEMweb Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGold Member \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPOC Blood Gas Analyzer\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStat Profile Prime Plus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSilver Member \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCompact 14-Day Uninterrupted Holter ECG\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNR-314P\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWasher Disinfector\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTIVA 10-M\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest Critical Care News\\n\\nCold Plasma to Revolutionize Treatment of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia and Reduce MortalityNanosized Implantable Sensor to Advance Treatment for Spinal Cord Neurological Disorders and InjuryIngestible Micro-Robot Wirelessly Navigates Stomach for Remote Diagnosis of GI Tract New Cellular Immunotherapy Approach Effective In Treating Metastatic Solid Tumors AI Model Accurately Predicts Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy Survival Wireless Implantable LED Device Treats Deep-Seated Cancers Using Light \\u2018Band-Aid\\u2019 Measures Glucose Levels in Sweat Using Microlaser Technology Stretchable Skin-Conformable Bioelectrodes Demonstrate Promising Capabilities for Healthcare WearablesAI-Powered Tool Combs through Electronic Health Records For Faster Diagnoses of Rare Diseases Wearable Patch Accurately and Continuously Measures Trace Perspiration for Disease Detection Nanorobot with Hidden Weapon Precisely Targets and Kills Cancer Cells Groundbreaking System Combining Leadless Pacemaker with Subcutaneous Defibrillator to Revolutionize Cardiac Care Novel Hydrogel Could Provide Alternative to Pacemakers Novel Capsule Releases Microscopic Robots into Colon to Treat Inflammatory Bowel DiseaseInnovative Cuffless Blood Pressure Device Streamlines and Enhances Hypertension Management New Study Challenges ED Protocols for Geriatric Head Injuries and Blood Thinners  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChannels\\n\\n\\nSurgical Techniques\\nview channel\\n\\n\\n\\nBreakthrough AR Surgical System Brings Precision-Enhanced Visualization into the...\\n \\nAdvances in Image-Guided Methods Enabling Intelligent Surgical Robots for Precise...\\n \\nAugmented Reality Headset Gives Surgeons \\\"X-Ray Vision\\\" During Procedures\\n \\nPulsed Field Ablation Procedures Found Safe and Effective For Atrial Fibrillation...\\n\\n\\n Breakthrough AR Surgical System Brings Precision-Enhanced Visualization into the OR \\nState-of-the-art mixed reality and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are revolutionizing the field of surgery.

We look forward to having the other health insurance organizations in Colorado match this important benefit and update their coverage policies accordingly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSubscribe to NoCamels weekly newsletter and get our top stories\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\nIsraeli Saliva-Based Pregnancy Test Sold At UK's Top Pharmacy Chain\\n\\nJuly 17, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFintech Firm Papaya Launches Payroll And Payment Academy\\n\\nJuly 16, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSecurity Firm Receives European Government Orders Worth Millions\\n\\nJuly 16, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTAU Model Measures Neurological Disease Via Step Length\\n\\nJuly 15, 2024\\n \\n\\n\\nFacebook comments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWeekly Newsletter\\n\\n\\nNOCAMELS\\nWeekly Highlights\\nStraight To Your Inbox\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nVideo Storieslike usNoCamels -

The discussion highlighted the simplicity of understanding effective systems, using Buc-ee\\u2019s gas stations\\u2019 success, known for their clean restrooms, as an analogy for consistency and excellence.\\nMatranga and Monsive emphasized the importance of communication in safety systems. They advocated for transitioning from outdated analog intercoms to modern IP-based systems while retaining essential hardwired buttons. These updated systems provide multiple advanced functions: pressing a button can trigger various actions such as sending an email, making an outbound call, contacting 911, or alerting administrators and law enforcement.\\nThe simplicity of hardwired systems, which are consistently located throughout a building, ensures everyone, including substitute teachers, can easily locate and use them. This contrasts with wearable devices, which often face numerous challenges. Companies promoting silent panic alarms require extensive cabling and gateways, complicating implementation and maintenance. These gateways cover limited areas, necessitating more hardware and resources.\\nMoreover, wearable devices come with their own set of issues. They are battery-operated, requiring regular monitoring and replacement, and are prone to being damaged, lost, or forgotten. Initially, teachers may be diligent in using these devices, but over time, their usage often declines.\\nMatranga and Monsive stressed that the reliance on such unreliable devices could jeopardize lives, advocating for simpler, more reliable solutions. Their discussion underscores the need for effective, easy-to-use safety systems in schools, ensuring that all staff members can efficiently respond in emergencies.\\nFollow Along for More From Secured!\\n\\n\\n\\nRecent Episodes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nView episode\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare Show\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLinkedIn\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTwitter\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLink\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nhttps://marketscale.com/industries/education-technology/strength-in-unity-enhancing-school-safety-through-law-enforcement-collaboration/?ctb_post=1\\nCopied!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStrength in Unity: Enhancing School Safety Through Law Enforcement Collaboration\\n\\nIn today\\u2019s episode of School Safety Today by Raptor Technologies, join host Dr. Amy Grosso as she sits down with Officer Meg Soultz, Co-Founder of Rescue in Color.\\u00a0 Together, they delve into the vital collaboration between law enforcement and school districts to enhance school safety.\\u00a0 Meg shares insights from her diverse career in public\\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nView episode\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare Show\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLinkedIn\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTwitter\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLink\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nhttps://marketscale.com/industries/education-technology/challenges-in-implementing-school-safety-products/?ctb_post=1\\nCopied!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChallenges in Implementing School Safety Products\\n\\nIn a recent episode of Secured, host Mike Matranga and guest Izzy Fried of Fox2Sierra discussed the challenges of identifying and implementing effective school safety products.\\u00a0They emphasized that while tools like metal detectors can be beneficial, they shouldn\\u2019t be viewed as standalone solutions that eliminate the need for ongoing situational awareness and comprehensive security\\u2026\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nView episode\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare Show\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLinkedIn\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTwitter\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFacebook\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLink\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nhttps://marketscale.com/industries/education-technology/cooking-up-second-chances-with-celebrity-chef-fernando-ruiz-episode-2/?ctb_post=1\\nCopied!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCooking up Second Chances with Celebrity Chef Fernando Ruiz: Episode 2\\n\\nThe Alliance for Adult Education is proud to announce a strategic partnership with Jamai Blivin, CEO at Innovate+Educate and The Entrepreneurial of Northern New Mexico.

DOI: 10.1038/s41591-024-03094-4\\n             \\n\\nA study published in Nature Medicine examined if a commercially-available fitness tracker and smartphone could continuously monitor the response to medications, and provide clinical information similar to in-person hospital assessment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe wearable devices, consisting of a wrist band and connected smartphone, collected a vast amount of data on the response to two different medications prescribed as part of a clinical trial called RATE-AF.\\nLed by researchers from the cardiac group at the University of Birmingham, the team used artificial intelligence to help analyze over 140 million datapoints for heart rate in 53 individuals over 20 weeks. They found that digoxin and beta-blockers had a similar effect on heart rate, even after accounting for differences in physical activity. This was in contrast to previous studies that had only assessed the short-term impact of digoxin.\\nA neural network that took account of missing information was developed to avoid an over-optimistic view of the wearable data stream. Using this approach, the team found that the wearables were equivalent to standard tests often used in hospitals and clinical trials that require staff time and resources. The average age of participants in the study was 76 years, highlighting possible future value regardless of age or experience with technology.\\nProfessor Dipak Kotecha from the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences at the University of Birmingham and the lead author of the study said, \\\"People across the world are increasingly using wearable devices in their daily lives to help monitor their activity and health status. This study shows the potential to use this new technology to assess the response to treatment and make a positive contribution to the routine care of patients.\\\"\\n\\\"Heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure are expected to double in prevalence over the next few decades, leading to a large burden on patients as well as substantial health care cost. This study is an exciting showcase for how artificial intelligence can support new ways to help treat patients better.\\\"\\n\\nMore information:\\n                                                    Simrat K.

And although it was bulkier, it felt surprisingly lightweight compared to trackers of similar size.\\nThe Garmin Venu 3 allows you to track sets and reps while weightlifting.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nA step up from Garmin\\u2019s Venu 2, the Venu 3 is also geared toward average gym-goers but includes upgraded features like sleep coaching, post-workout recovery insights and a more advanced heart rate sensor. I found the recovery time predictions useful for planning my daily movement after working out, including how many walks to take and when to go to bed. I was also able to create my workouts within the Garmin Connect app and load them onto the watch, down to the sets, reps and exact exercises. Other notable features include more than 30 preloaded sports apps and workouts, as well as personalized sleep coaching. Overall, I found the Garmin Venu 3 to be an advanced watch that takes a holistic approach to fitness without being intimidating to use.\\n The Garmin Venu has become something of a personal coach to me after training with it for four months. I\\u2019ve seen improved results in the gym like PR\\u2019s (personal records) during lifting and greater endurance after following the watch\\u2019s post-workout recovery advice and sleep tips. The battery life also blows away any other tracker I\\u2019ve used. After noticing mid-workout that my watch was down to less than 5% in battery, the power-saving mode helped it hold on for not only the rest of my workout but three more hours after that. I do wish the interface was a bit more intuitive. Navigating to features on the watch like the post-workout summary can be a bit confusing, even after using the watch consistently.\\nThe 2024 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing.Best Fitness Tracker For BeginnersA No-Fuss Design That Checks All The BoxesAmazonFitbit Charge 6 Our score: 8.5/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: 5 ATM | Display: AMOLED touchscreen | Battery life: 7 days | ECG monitor: Yes | Compatibility: iPhone and AndroidWhat\\u2019s notable:Weekly progress reports measure improvement over time across a variety of areas\\u00a0Lightweight fit and slim designBenchmarks for sleep quality and duration\\u00a0Easy to use and understandWhat could be better:Initial setup had hiccups; had to perform a hard reset to sync with phoneNo physical buttons\\n\\nFor beginners looking to track their workouts in a seamless and manageable way, I recommend the Fitbit Charge 6. If you\\u2019re just starting out with a regular exercise program, the last thing you want to do is complicate your routine by introducing an elaborate fitness tracker. The Charge 6 is the brand\\u2019s latest iteration in its Charge series. Of the trackers I tested, it was the simplest to use while offering a surprising level of versatility and accuracy, given its basic design.When I took the Charge 6 on a hike, it tracked my average pace.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nThe Charge 6 can do just about anything most trackers can do: count steps and distance, track sleep (including sleep stages), recognize when you\\u2019re engaging in one of nearly 40 different workouts and monitor key health indicators, like irregular heart rhythms, stress, moods and menstrual cycles. The Charge 6 also features a more advanced heart rate monitor than its predecessors, which paid off in its level of accuracy during my testing. It kept up with my heart rate during high-intensity workouts, which is typically where I find most trackers fail in their ability to measure my varying heart rate accurately. I went from 160 bpm (beats per minute) during the middle of a set to around 120 bpm during rest\\u2014all within a 30-second to one-minute window\\u2014and the Charge 6\\u2019s tracking was right in line with my control device through it all (the Polar H10 Chest Strap).\\nUnlike other trackers that can make it hard to break down what all of the numbers mean, the Charge 6\\u2019s insights were straightforward. It communicated updates to me via weekly progress reports and daily scores for sleep and stress management\\u2014all of which broke down my stats using cute graphics, bright colors and easy-to-follow insights.\\nAfter using this tracker for four months, I still enjoy the Fitbit\\u2019s simple interface and uncomplicated design. I\\u2019ve found, however, that the accuracy of the heart rate tracking can be inconsistent. During a few lifting sessions, the heart rate tracking got a slow start and was off for a few sets compared to my control (the Polar H10 chest strap) before catching up by the middle to end of my workout. This was somewhat annoying, although it didn\\u2019t seem to skew my overall post-workout summary data, which was usually still in line with my control for metrics like estimated calories burned and average heart rate.Best Fitness Tracker For Apple UsersA Top-Rated Smartwatch That Keeps You Moving AmazonApple Watch Series 9 Our score: 8.5/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: WR50 | Display: Retina LTPO OLED touchscreen | Battery life: 18 hours (36 hours in low power mode) | ECG monitor: Yes | Compatibility: iPhoneWhat\\u2019s notable:Seamless integration with iPhone and the ability to go completely phone-freeCustomizable with a wide variety of bands and facesAttractive design and scratch-proof faceWhat could be better:Battery life is much shorter than other trackersOnly compatible with iPhones\\nFor Apple users looking for the most convenient option, the Apple Watch Series 9 is my top choice. Equipped with more features than the SE and more affordable than the Apple Watch Ultra, the Series 9 checks all the boxes for an everyday, high-performing fitness tracker. It was a close second to the Garmin Venu 3 for my favorite tracker for training, in large part due to its advanced heart rate tracking. It accurately tracked my heart rate variability, including how long I spent in certain zones, my walking heart rate and how long it took my body to return to normal, post-exercise.\\nHowever, the 9 is a smartwatch at its core; it can\\u2019t compete with Garmin\\u2019s workout analytics and training feedback, or the superior integration with the Garmin Connect app. While I did find it convenient to have all of my workout stats recorded and readily available in my iPhone\\u2019s Health app, it doesn\\u2019t summarize your information in the way the Connect app does or offer recommendations for recovery.The Apple Watch 9 could detect what stroke I was swimming and for how long, which is a unique ... [+] feature among the other fitness trackers I tested.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nSomething the 9 offered that the Garmin doesn\\u2019t, though, is the ability to detect movement automatically. I appreciated how quickly the Apple Watch Series 9 could sense the type of exercise I was doing, so I never had to manually record activities like outdoor walks or yoga. It even detected which stroke I was swimming when I tested it in the pool. As for its design, the Series 9 (like other Apple wearables) is a sleek watch that\\u2019s aesthetically much more advanced than a often-clunkier traditional fitness tracker. For Apple users looking for a more advanced smartwatch that can track your workouts, you\\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a better option than the Series 9.\\nAfter consistently using the Apple Watch and comparing it to others I\\u2019ve tested and tried, the Series 9\\u2019s seamless integration with my iPhone makes it one of the most convenient fitness trackers to use among the ones I tested. Having all of my health information in one place on my phone\\u2014rather than in a companion app\\u2014makes it easy to keep close tabs on my overall health and to monitor progress over a longer period of time. However, the short battery life proved to be a real pain point with this tracker. Because I have to charge the watch almost as frequently as I do my phone, it discouraged me from using the Apple Watch compared to other trackers because I found it hard to keep up with charging two devices on a daily basis.Best Budget Fitness TrackerAccuracy Meets Affordability In This Fitbit DupeAmazonAmazfit Bip 3 Pro Buy From AmazonOur score: 8/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: 5 ATM | Display: TFT touchscreen | Battery life: 14 days | ECG monitor: No | Compatibility: iPhone, AndroidWhat\\u2019s notable:Accuracy is on par with more expensive modelsMid-sized touchscreen with comfortable silicone strapTracks over 60 different activitiesLonger battery life than mostWhat could be better:Limited strength-training insightsNot the most aesthetically appealing design\\nIf you don\\u2019t want to spend more than $100 on a fitness tracker, I recommend the Amazfit Bip Pro 3. While it\\u2019s not the best-looking or most feature-rich tracker, it gets the job done and was accurate across heart rate, activity and sleep tracking (for metrics like time spent in bed and minutes spent awake). When I first unboxed it, the square screen and thick silicone band immediately reminded me of the Fitbit Versa, and based on its comparable tracking options, I can confirm it\\u2019s a pretty solid dupe. (The newest model of the Fitness Versa, the Versa 4, retails for $200.)During my weightlifting sessions, the Amazfit Bip Pro 3 accurately measured my heart rate compared ... [+] to my control.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nThe watch\\u2019s interface is intuitive and didn\\u2019t require so much as a glance through the user manual. I also liked that I had an abundance of activity tracking options to choose from. However, the post-workout insights were varied. For weight training, they\\u2019re limited to heart rate data. Cardio-based activities, like a treadmill run, come with more detailed insights. Despite the somewhat meager training insights, I still found it to be a user-friendly tracker that offers value for the price.Best Fitness Tracker For RunnersGet A Personalized Training Plan For Your Next RaceAmazonGarmin Forerunner 265 Our score: 8/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: 5 ATM | Display: Colorful AMOLED touchscreen | Battery life: 20 hours in GPS-only mode, 13 days in smartwatch mode | ECG monitor: Yes | Compatibility: iPhone, AndroidWhat\\u2019s notable:Advanced GPS tracking, great for those who train outdoorsTraining readiness score that gives recommendations for workout intensityMore buttons on the watch that make it easier to use mid-workout, including a start/stop timerPersonalized training insights for specific races or eventsBright display that\\u2019s easy to read in sunlightWhat could be better:Fit is bulkyPricier option\\nThe most feature-rich tracker I tested, the Garmin Forerunner 265 is an ideal option for runners, outdoor enthusiasts and anyone with specific training goals. Like its name suggests, it\\u2019s heavy on the running-centric features, like built-in workouts, distance-specific pacing strategies and realtime performance readings. While I\\u2019m not much of a runner myself, I still found some of these functions useful. The training readiness score recommends workout intensity based on the quantity and quality of your sleep, stress levels and heart rate variability. After a poor night of rest, for instance, my training readiness score wasn\\u2019t nearly as high as after I\\u2019d had a good night\\u2019s sleep, which told me it probably wasn\\u2019t the best day for an intense session.The Forerunner 265 estimates your running power, or the amount of power applied to a run, based on ... [+] factors like pace and wind conditions.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nI also let my fianc\\u00e9\\u2014who often goes on long-distance runs and rucks\\u2014give it a spin. He loved the running power feature, which predicted how much force he applied to his run and how to maximize his workouts based on factors like the intensity of the wind. (Anyone who\\u2019s experienced springtime in Colorado knows the wind is no joke.) Design-wise, the Garmin Forerunner 265 has a rugged look and a sturdier, durable feel. For endurance athletes and outdoor enthusiasts looking for a robust option, the Forerunner 265 is a clear winner.Best Fitness Tracker For WomenA Small But Mighty Watch With Impressive AccuracyAmazonGarmin Lily 2Our score: 9/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: 5 ATM | Display: Liquid crystal touchscreen | Battery life: 5 days | ECG monitor: Yes | Compatibility: iPhone, AndroidWhat\\u2019s notable:Lightweight design and feel that made it the most comfortable to sleep withDetailed post-workout insights for a variety of activities, weightlifting includedComes in a variety of soft neutral colors, including a brown leather optionOffers features like fertility trackingWhat could be better:Watch face is on the smaller side, making interface navigation trickyNo buttons, and screen can be unresponsive at times\\nWhile most wearables can keep close tabs on your menstrual cycle, if you want to track your ovulation, peak fertility days and pregnancy, the Garmin Lily 2 is your best option. It was the smallest tracker I tested, but it held its own against some of the more advanced watches on the docket.The Garmin Lily comes in a vibrant lilac color, as well as gold, bronze and silver. Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nSimilar to the Venu 3, this tracker measures energy expenditure by updating your body battery with recommended rest times and activity levels, and it also highlights which muscles you worked during physical activity. After a strength-training session, the Lily\\u2019s post-workout app summary listed the types of exercises I performed, from barbell squats to sumo-stance deadlifts. Named the most stylish in Forbes Vetted\\u2019s best smartwatches for women guide, the tracker also features thoughtful design touches that I appreciated, like a patterned lens, hidden display option and the choice between a leather or nylon strap that made it feel less like a piece of fitness tech and more of a fashion accessory. And despite the superlative category named here, this watch isn\\u2019t just for women: If you\\u2019re looking for a smaller, stylish wearable or want one with fertility tracking features, the Lily 2 is the best choice.Best Fitness Tracker For Android UsersAdvanced Health Insights With A Smartwach DesignAmazonSamsung Galaxy Watch6 Our score: 8/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: IP68 | Display: AMOLED touchscreen | Battery life: 22 hours | ECG monitor: Yes | Compatibility: AndroidWhat\\u2019s notable:Sleek design; large touchscreen with slim profileLightweightPersonalized heart rate zonesMore affordable than the Apple Watch with comparable featuresWhat could be better:Shorter battery life than other optionsDoesn\\u2019t offer the same level of activity tracking as dedicated sports watches\\nSitting squarely at the intersection of fitness tracker and smartwatch, the Samsung Galaxy Watch6 offers smartphone capabilities for Android users that are similar to Apple\\u2019s, but with slightly more advanced health tracking. (Testing the Galaxy Watch6 may have been one of the only times I\\u2019ve second-guessed my choice in a smartphone.) I liked how I could set personalized heart rate zones, which notified me once I hit my target zone. Although this feature is probably more beneficial to runners than other types of athlete, I enjoyed using it for strength training, particularly for workouts when my intensity is sometimes lacking.The Samsung Galaxy 6 has a bigger face than other trackers I tested, yet was one of the most ... [+] lightweight.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nLightweight, comfortable and easy to adjust, the Galaxy Watch6 felt more like a second skin. Its battery life was slightly disappointing, though likely a byproduct of its hybrid design. And compared to true fitness watches like Garmin\\u2019s, it has a couple of limitations. While I liked the Galaxy\\u2019s personalized heart rate tracking, it doesn\\u2019t track heart rate variability (or the time between each heartbeat) like the Garmin Venu 3, Lily 2 or Forerunner 265 each do. The Venu 3 and Forerunner 265 also edged out the Galaxy when it came to GPS tracking and in-depth post-workout insights. All things considered, I found the Galaxy Watch6 to be an excellent option for Android users who want to keep tabs on their workouts and health but ultimately prefer a smartwatch design (and the tracking limitations that come with it) to a true fitness tracker.\\nMORE FROMFORBES VETTEDThe 44 Best Prime Day Luggage Deals To Shop NowByRebecca IsaacsForbes StaffThe 27 Best Prime Day Apple Deals: Save On MacBooks, AirPods And MoreByJordan ThomasForbes Staff\\nOther Fitness Trackers I TestedI put 13 different fitness trackers through a series of test to find the overall best.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nApple Watch SE (7/10): While not quite on a par with the Series 9 features- or size-wise, the SE is a solid alternative for Apple users looking to spend a little less. It\\u2019s easy to use, accurate and stylish, plus offers a similar range of strap and watch face options. However, the SE is more of a smartwatch than a fitness tracker, so it doesn\\u2019t provide as much data for sleep and health tracking.\\nApple Watch Ultra (7.5/10): I found the Ultra 2\\u2019s feature-heavy interface to be overkill. More serious athletes may benefit from the extra data and tracking capabilities this watch offers, but the average fit person or everyday user likely won\\u2019t have much use for the majority of these features. The Series 9 is easier to use, less bulky and about $400 less, making it the better choice for most.\\nCoros Pace 3 (7/10): Although the Coros offered incredibly detailed tracking for endurance activities and cardio-based workouts, I found the interface trickier to navigate than others, and the bulky size made for an awkward fit.\\nOura Ring (7/10): I found the minimalist design of the Oura more aesthetically appealing than a traditional wearable, but the tracker wasn\\u2019t functional enough to incorporate into my regular workout routine. Because it doesn\\u2019t have a screen, it took more of an effort to check my stats mid-workout. When I did review my progress in the app, the data was inaccurate compared to my control. The sleep tracking on the Oura is exceptional, and provides in-depth data on sleep stages and sleep quality. This fitness tracker could be a good option for people more interested in improving their rest.\\nWithings ScanWatch Light (6.5/10): Aesthetically, the Withings was perhaps my favorite fitness tracker; its polished design is more watch-like than others I tested. Unfortunately, the heart rate tracking was inconsistent during my workouts, which rendered any post-workout data unreliable.\\nWhoop (6/10): Post-workout insights like heart rate and estimated calorie burn were inconsistent compared to my control and to other trackers I tested. I also found the app interface a bit overwhelming, but advanced athletes or gym-goers willing to spend more time upfront with the device may find it appealing. The minimalist design was also a roadblock for me. I found it inconvenient to have to unlock my phone mid-workout to check the app for basic metrics like heart rate and time elapsed. I did, however, appreciate the insights from Whoop\\u2019s strain score (similar to Garmin\\u2019s training readiness score), which monitors how much energy you\\u2019ve exerted and offers recommendations for recovery (although my score was lower than expected since the heart rate tracking was off).\\nXiaomi Mi Smart Band 8 (5/10):  Tracking was inaccurate and inconsistent across a variety of workouts and activities on this budget tracker.\\nHow I Tested The Best Fitness Trackers\\nThe best fitness trackers should provide accurate tracking, good battery life, a comfortable fit and a design that\\u2019s appealing to you. They should support an active lifestyle with a variety of health and activity tracking options, and they should be easy to use. Based on my experience as a personal trainer and on my weeks of testing these devices, I found that you\\u2019re less likely to use a tracker if the interface is complicated, if you can\\u2019t make sense of the metrics or if it\\u2019s a hassle to use while exercising.\\n\\u201cThe number one thing to consider is whether you truly believe the tracker is going to enhance your experience in fitness and training,\\u201d says Josh Honore, NASM-certified personal trainer and coach at Row House. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re having a good time doing this [tracking], all roads lead to success.\\u201d\\nThat said, the best fitness tracker for you may look different than the ideal option for someone else. There were baseline requirements I considered before deciding whether a fitness tracker would make my list of winners, but I also incorporated different use cases. So even if a fitness tracker wasn\\u2019t ideal for me, I thought about who it could be best for. Here\\u2019s an in-depth look at the specific criteria I used to determine which fitness trackers are a cut above the rest:\\nHeart rate accuracy: This is the most important function of a fitness tracker. Without accurate heart rate readings, nearly every other metric (calorie burn, estimated expenditure, estimated intensity, recovery recommendations, etc.) will be off, thus rendering any activity insights useless. To test each tracker\\u2019s accuracy, I used a control: the Polar H10 Chest Strap, which is regarded as one of the most accurate heart rate monitors on the market since it measures your heart rate directly, rather than through your pulse.\\nI put each tracker through a series of workouts consisting of strength training with light cardio, and compared the tracker\\u2019s heart rate reading to the companion app and to the Polar H10. I examined and compared key heart rate stats like average heart rate, max heart rate, percentage of time spent in certain heart rate zones and estimated calorie burn. Since chest-band heart rate sensors are considered the most accurate type of heart rate tracker, I expected some variation between my control and the fitness trackers. The fitness trackers that were the closest to the Polar were the ones I rated most accurate.\\nBattery life: I tested battery life by charging each tracker to 100%, then wearing it for two full days and two nights. Some\\u2014like the Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 9 and Samsung\\u2019s Watch6\\u2014required a charge during that two-day period, while others still had plenty of battery left. At the least, each tracker needed to last the better part of a day (i.e., a full night\\u2019s rest and a workout the following day) or to have a fast-charge option available for convenience.\\nEase of use: To measure how easy each tracker was to use, I started by timing how long the initial unboxing and setup took me, taking note of any roadblocks. (The Fitbit Charge 6 was quick to set up but required a hard reset before it would sync with my phone.) Most took 5 to 10 minutes, but the true test was how easy it was to learn to use the app and watch features. If I had gotten the hang of things by the time I was wearing it at the gym\\u2014and didn\\u2019t need to look up how to sift through different activity options and start, stop and pause my workout\\u2014I deemed it easy to use.I wore each fitness tracker to bed to test how well it could monitor my sleep throughout the night.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nHealth and activity tracking: To test each watch\\u2019s health and activity tracking, I wore each tracker to sleep, to the gym and during every activity (or rest period) in between. This gave me a comprehensive view of each tracker\\u2019s capabilities and accuracy. When analyzing health tracking, I examined the types of insights each tracker provided about my sleep, cycle and stress levels, and the specificity of each. For example, some trackers provided a more in-depth look at my sleeping habits, including personalized tips on how to get better rest the next night and how my quality of rest affected my ability to recover. I also looked at how each tracker presented these insights (sleep scores, stress scores, etc.) and considered which were helpful for contextualizing the data, rather than giving me an arbitrary number with no real context as to how it affected my overall health.\\nFor activity tracking, I looked at how many activity or sport modes were available and how well each watch tracked my movement during those workouts and activities. I looked at the types of metrics recorded for different workouts (strength training, pool swim, outdoor walks, etc.), how well it did this compared to my control and whether the data provided useful insights for my current and next workout.\\nOverall fit and design: To get a feel for the overall fit of each tracker, I wore them to bed, during workouts and throughout my day to test their comfort. I considered factors like overall size, the material of the band, weight and adjustability. In some instances, like with Garmin\\u2019s Venu 3, the bulk didn\\u2019t make for a heavy-handed feel, whereas others (like the Coros) definitely felt their size. I also considered the size and design of the watch: how big or small the face was and whether it had buttons or knobs that made it easy to select different features.\\nHow To Pick A Fitness Tracker\\nIt can be challenging\\u2014and, frankly, overwhelming\\u2014to sift through all of the different fitness trackers, from smartwatches to dedicated devices. Below, I break down key factors to consider to simplify your search for the best fitness tracker for you.\\nIntended Use\\nConsider your purpose for using a fitness tracker before browsing. Some fitness trackers work better for specific types of activities, whereas others are more of an all-purpose wearable. Do you want a tracker that excels at running? Swimming? Cycling? All of the above? Or do you want one that can keep up with you at the gym and the activities in between? If you have special health concerns, or if you\\u2019re trying to conceive or are currently pregnant, you\\u2019ll want to find a more advanced tracker.I liked the bigger face of the Garmin Venu 3 because it made it easy to quickly check my heart rate ... [+] mid-workout.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nPrice\\nFitness trackers range in price from as little as $50 to $800 or more, though most options lie somewhere in the $150 to $400 range. When setting your budget, make sure to consider the most important features for you. Generally speaking, the more features a watch has (including advanced GPS tracking, in-depth training insights, ability to track race-specific paces, etc.), the higher its cost. However, most fitness trackers in the $150 to $300 range offer valuable features for the average person.\\nBattery Life\\nFitness trackers can vary significantly when it comes to battery life. Some can last up to two weeks on a full charge, while others can\\u2019t make it through a full 24 hours. Think about how you plan on using your tracker; if you\\u2019re looking to take it along for a backpacking trip or ultramarathon, you\\u2019ll need one with a robust battery. Some fitness trackers also come with a fast-charge option, which is a nice compromise for those who don\\u2019t necessarily need a two-week battery life but also don\\u2019t want to be glued to an outlet.\\nDesign\\nYou\\u2019ll get more use out of a fitness tracker that\\u2019s user-friendly, comfortable to wear and nice to look at. Consider your own comfort and style preferences and the overall purpose you want your tracker to serve. Endurance athletes may compromise on size and style if it means getting more advanced GPS tracking, while those looking for a casual option may prioritize aesthetics.The Fitbit Charge 6 has a thick silicone band that I found comfortable and easy to adjust.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nAlso keep in mind the different types of materials for bands, since this will be the part of the tracker that rests on your wrist. Most come with a few options, like silicone, leather or nylon. In my experience, silicone and nylon are usually the most comfortable and easiest to adjust.\\nLastly, decide whether you want a minimalist design, like the Whoop or Oura. \\u201cA lot of my clients don\\u2019t like things on their wrist,\\u201d says Honore, who works with dancers who don\\u2019t want to be distracted by a screen. You may prefer having a screen so that you can glance down during a workout and check your progress.\\nMy Expertise\\nI\\u2019ve been an ACE-certified personal trainer for nearly two years. Throughout my own training and sessions with clients, I\\u2019ve used countless fitness trackers, which have helped me learn the most useful features to look for. I\\u2019ve also been active for as long as I can remember: I was a competitive swimmer for 13 years, and I now hike and do strength training.\\nFor this guide, I spoke with Josh Honore, NASM-certified personal trainer and California-based Row House coach, about his experience using fitness trackers, both personally and professionally. I also consulted Laura Rooney, PhD, an associate professor at Marquette University and a behavioral psychologist. We discussed the psychological and physiological effects of fitness trackers and how they can be best used by different groups of people, including those new to exercise and people with chronic health conditions, among others.\\nWhen deciding which trackers to test, I considered key features that experts highlighted as important for getting practical use out of a tracker, then I pored over online reviews, leveraged my own experience and tapped my network of gym friends and outdoor enthusiasts for insights. I prioritized brands known for accuracy and reliability, and I considered options for people of all fitness levels, not just athletes.\\nWhich Fitness Tracker Is Most Accurate?\\nBased on my testing, I found the Garmin Venu 3 to be the most accurate. It was extremely accurate at measuring my average heart rate, max heart rate and estimated calorie burn during workouts as compared to my control, the Polar H10 Chest Strap. It also accurately sensed which muscles I targeted during exercise.\\nWhat Are The Benefits To Using A Fitness Tracker?\\nFitness trackers are great not only for optimizing your training, but also for telling you when you should slow down and how to slow down. Honore enjoys using a fitness tracker for more than just training. \\u201cMy bedtime routine links into [mine], so I stretch for 20 minutes or so then do a guided relaxation for 5 minutes.

The biggest thing we can do for ourselves is create intuition around our stimulus,\\u201d says Honore.\\nLastly, fitness trackers can also benefit those who have health conditions by keeping close tabs on key metrics. \\u201cI work mostly in medical exercise, [which] fitness trackers have great potential with,\\u201d says Rooney. \\u201cWhen I work with cardiac rehab patients and post-cancer treatment patients, we use different forms of fitness trackers that we can share with their health and medical teams. We\\u2019ll put monitors on [them] because then we can see what\\u2019s going on with their heart rate and blood pressure during workout sessions, and then we can monitor and make sure they\\u2019re staying in good parameters.\\u201d\\nMore Tech Wearables To Shop\\n\\n\\nBest Smartwatches\\nBest Android Smartwatches\\nBest Golf Watches\\nBest Apple Watch Bands\\n\\n\\n Send me a secure\\u00a0tip.\\u00a0Katie SimpsonFollowingEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions\",\n        \"type\": \"Document\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"lc\": 1,\n      \"type\": \"constructor\",\n      \"id\": [\n        \"langchain\",\n        \"schema\",\n        \"document\",\n        \"Document\"\n      ],\n      \"kwargs\": {\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"source\": \"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/07/11/2911971/32656/en/Wearable-AI-Market-is-expected-to-Grow-at-an-8-3-CAGR-and-Reach-USD-146-2-billion-by-2034-Report-by-Transparency-Market-Research-Inc.html\",\n          \"title\": \"Wearable AI Market is expected to Grow at an 8.3% CAGR and\",\n          \"description\": \"AI-powered wearables offer customized fitness plans and real-time coaching, adapting to individual goals and progress....\",\n          \"language\": \"en\"\n        },\n        \"page_content\": \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWearable AI Market is expected to Grow at an 8.3% CAGR and\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccessibility: Skip TopNav\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWearable AI Market is expected to Grow at an 8.3% CAGR and Reach USD 146.2 billion by 2034| Report by Transparency Market Research, Inc.\\nAI-powered wearables offer customized fitness plans and real-time coaching, adapting to individual goals and progress.\\n\\n\\n\\nJuly 11, 2024 11:06 ET\\n\\n\\r\\n            | Source:\\r\\n            \\nTransparency Market Research\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTransparency Market Research\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWilmington, Delaware, United States, Transparency Market Research.

Jack Wu, DIGITIMES Asia\\n\\nWednesday 17 July 2024\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: DIGITIMES\\n\\nDespite a decline in demand for devices like smartwatches in the first half of the year, Samsung remains hopeful that new products and marketing strategies will drive a turnaround in wearable device sales.Recently, Samsung unveiled its latest Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 foldable smartphones, along with the Galaxy Watch Ultra, Galaxy Watch 7, and true wireless Bluetooth earphones Galaxy Buds3 Pro and Galaxy Buds3.Samsung noted that thanks to the strong sales of the Galaxy S24 series, the sales revenue of smartphones priced above US$600 grew by 15%, resulting in a 7-8% year-on-year increase in Samsung's smartphone sales revenue, outperforming the overall market.Regarding smartwatch sales, Samsung stated that from January to May 2024, the overall smartwatch sales volume decreased by 15% compared to the same period in 2023, with sales revenue also dropping by over 11%. However, Samsung's smartwatch sales volume and revenue grew by 2% and 7% year-on-year respectively. In addition, earphone products saw a nearly 30% year-on-year increase in sales revenue.Samsung believes that the high penetration rate of the wearable device market and the wide range of products from brand manufacturers make it relatively challenging to fully display these items in physical stores. This is why significant growth opportunities will be hard to come by in the future wearable device market.To boost sales, Samsung plans to introduce a more comprehensive product lineup to cater to different consumer groups. Additionally, the company will enhance efforts to bundle wearables with smartphone sales, using methods like add-on purchases to attract market attention. Moreover, Samsung will strengthen product experiences to boost consumers' purchase willingness.Samsung emphasized that consumer brand preference for Samsung grew by over 40% year-on-year in 2023. The proportion of new young users also increased from 13% to 43%. To align with trends, besides continuing to optimize products, marketing, and sales channels, Samsung will also seek cross-industry collaboration opportunities with sectors like music and gaming to boost its brand power.Furthermore, Samsung highlighted that its Galaxy AI ecosystem is more complete than its competitors. By continuing to empower its products with AI, Samsung aims to create a greater differentiation in brand value and product strength over its peers.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated storiesSamsung's new smartwatches, smart rings bolster its AI ecosystemNew Samsung smartphones showcase foldables, GenAIPC designs growing more revolutionarySamsung takes dual-track approach with smartwatches and smartphones to expand Galaxy AI ecosystemHuawei ramping up Kirin chip output for smart wearablesShow moreCategoriesAI IT + CE IT components, peripherals Tagsbrand demand Galaxy revenue sales Samsung smartphone smartwatch wearable \\n\\nShare this article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther links\\n\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated topicGlobal supply chain: Emerging tech, businesses\\n\\n\\n\\nBIZ FOCUSJul 15, 10:35How cryptocurrency technology can enhance financial servicesMonday 15 July 2024Crypto Quantique partners with silicon IP distributors across Asia to deliver quantum-driven chip securityThursday 11 July 2024TechInsights: Americas' chip suppliers continue to dominate R&D spendingFriday 28 June 2024Why should busy professionals use AI for their passport size photo editing?TOP STORIES7 DAYS NEWSChinese brands dominate smartphone and TV markets via dual circulation strategyTaiwan fab toolmakers grab major orders from TSMC and ChinaIndian startup and semiconductor titans team up to bridge skill gapMediaTek to surpass Qualcomm Snapdragon in 5G smartphone marketAI server shipments to surge in 2H24 as GPU shortage easesSamsung latest LPDDR5 DRAM validated for use with Dimensity 9400China's counter-intuitive semiconductor exports surge goes unnoticedHuawei reveals operational hardship from US sanctions, expresses confidence in recoveryNvidia plans new China-specific AI and gaming GPUsTSMC joins HBM4 arena with 5nm base chip production for memory giantsFull list\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin our mailing list\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDIGITIMES\\n\\nAbout\\nAdvertising\\nMembership\\nTerms & conditions\\nPrivacy policy\\nCopyright policy\\nContact us\\nNotes & corrections\\nSite map\\n\\u4e2d\\u6587\\u7db2\\u7e41\\u9ad4\\n\\u4e2d\\u6587\\u7f51\\u7b80\\u4f53\\n\\n\\n\\nTOOLS & SERVICES\\n\\nTomorrow's Headlines\\n7 days news\\nWeb news elsewhere\\nTopics\\nRSS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a9\\u00a02024 DIGITIMES Inc.

It's a handy piece of tech that measures your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, body temperature, and more to provide data-driven guidance on your training regimen, and while they once used to be a niche wearable, major tech brands like Samsung have come out with smart rings of their own.\\u00a0Also:\\u00a0The best fitness trackersI love using my smart ring as I exercise, whether I'm riding a bike, doing core exercise, running, or dancing, because I can record my workout heart rate and get hyper-specific data that informs my rest and recovery program. Alongside data on my activity, smart rings also advise me when to take a break, get more rest, and pay attention to my health. They're far less bulky and discreet than a smartwatch, so I don't have to be tied to another screen as I exercise or sleep. However, I wouldn't recommend a smart ring to heavy weightlifters, climbers, or anyone who regularly uses their hands while exercising, given how the ring can pinch your skin as you lift weights or grip things.\\u00a0Also:\\u00a0Samsung unveils Galaxy Ring: Key features, price, and everything you need to knowWhat is the best fitness ring right now?\\u00a0Our pick for the best fitness ring overall is the\\u00a0Oura Ring Gen 3 Horizon\\u00a0for its comprehensive health suite, discreet form factor, high-quality materials, and impressive battery life. With Samsung's Galaxy Ring\\u00a0now available for preorder and many other companies throwing their hats in the ring (pun intended), we'll continue to test out all of the new fitness rings on the market and update this list with buying advice. Read on to find out how all the leading fitness ring options on the market compare and how to choose the best one.The best fitness rings of 2024  Oura Ring Gen 3 Horizon Best fitness ring for most people    Nina Raemont/ZDNET  Pros & Cons  Pros  Best sleep tracking on the market  Tracks steps and active calories  Heart rate monitor sensors to see how your workout was Cons  Pricey -- and a monthly membership is also required  Battery life can vary  Tarnishes easily More Details  The Oura Ring is one of the most popular fitness rings on the market, offering four different color options and various sizes. I wore the Horizon Oura Ring as I trained for a half marathon and am more than happy with its fitness features. You can record your workout heart rate on the app and view your activity score, inactive time, and burned calories. Then, the next day, you get a glance at your recovery scores to see how you bounced back from your intense workout. As it gets to know you, it can detect which activities you perform, whether that's running, walking, pickleball, or tennis, without you having to log it immediately.\\u00a0As the smart ring market becomes more competitive, Oura has been introducing new features after new feature to keep its top spot. In the past few months alone, the brand has introduced new heart health features, women's health features, and even a collaboration\\u00a0with Target.\\u00a0The ring is known for its exceptional\\u00a0sleep tracking. It provides insightful data that surpasses what you would receive from a Fitbit or the best smart rings. For instance, it displays your HRV balance, temperature changes during sleep (which can be used to predict menstrual cycles), blood oxygen levels, and the duration of each sleep stage.Review:\\u00a0Oura Ring Gen 3 HorizonIn addition to impressive sleep tracking, the Oura Ring excels in activity tracking. It monitors your steps, calories burned (including active calories), heart rate during exercise, and training volume. One new feature that separates Oura from other fitness rings is its resilience feature, which measures how well you bounce back from stress. Another fun Oura feature that runners will love is the ability to sync your Strava data to Oura and vice versa. When you record a run on the running app, it will immediately import into the Oura app. This is a lifesaver for me, an avid runner who sometimes forgets to start recording on one app before my run.\\u00a0In 2022, Oura introduced the Horizon model, which removes the flat spot at the top of the ring to make it entirely round like a regular ring. You can opt for the Heritage model, which starts at $299, or the new Horizon model, which starts at $349. One downside to note is its tendency to gain scratches and scrapes. Many Reddit users say that while the Oura Ring does sleep tracking well, it comes at a hefty price that may or may not be worth it to some.\\u00a0Oura Ring Gen 3 Horizon\\u00a0specs: Sizing:\\u00a06-13 |\\u00a0Material:\\u00a0Durable titanium and PVD coating |\\u00a0Colors: Silver, black, stealth, gold, rose gold |\\u00a0Water resistance:\\u00a0Up to 328 feet |\\u00a0Sensors: Heart rate, blood oxygen, PPG, skin temperature, 3D accelerometer |\\u00a0Connectivity:\\u00a0Bluetooth Low-Energy, Airplane Mode |\\u00a0Battery:\\u00a0Up to seven days   View now at AmazonView now at Best Buy  more buying choices   Ultrahuman Ring Air Best ring for fitness obsessives    Nina Raemont/ZDNET  Pros & Cons  Pros  Great health data metrics  Perfect for hardcore athletes  AI insights are actually helpful Cons  Ring gets pretty hot on your finger right after charging  App user experience is not intuitive More Details  If you don't want an Oura Ring, you should get yourself the Ultrahuman Ring Air. It is by far the runner-up in the smart ring race -- and that's no insult. Plus, it's consistently one of the top products ZDNET readers buy month after month; it even earned the number one spot in June, thank you very much.\\u00a0As I wrote in my review of the Ultrahuman Ring Air, \\\"If the Oura Ring is the girl next door, the Ultrahuman Ring Air is the Silicon Valley-based, Bitcoin-mining neighbor who drinks Soylent.\\\" This is the ring for fitness obsessives. The ring monitors all the good stuff: activity, sleep, and recovery. Plus, it prioritizes comfort and a sleek build that doesn't tarnish quickly or interfere with the rote tasks of your day, like carrying heavy bags, washing hands and dishes, and showering.\\u00a0What's remarkable about the Ultrahuman Ring Air is the notifications you get during or after your activity. For example, I went on a run with this ring one morning, and after my workout, it notified me to delay any caffeine for around an hour to allow the adenosine I built up from my run to flush out of my system. Later in the day, it reminded me to stretch my legs to recover from my morning run and relieve tension.\\u00a0Review:\\u00a0Ultrahuman Ring AirYou can also document your diet, while the ring's app offers AI insights into the health information behind each food you eat. Some of the data becomes excessive, but I can imagine that anyone who is all-in on optimizing their lifestyle for marathon training or some other fitness goal will find the information Ultrahuman offers useful. Plus, the app has a Discover tab with guided workouts for everything from pilates, high-intensity interval training, vinyasa yoga, and more. You can sync other workout app data, like the run you recorded on Strava, to the Ultrahuman app, which helps keep all your various activities in one place.\\u00a0The battery life is on par with Oura's, as I charged both simultaneously and found that they ran out of juice within hours of each other (about six days). And unlike the Oura Ring, which seemingly scratches when in contact with abrasive material, the Ultrahuman has maintained its sheen sans scratches. I don't have trouble recommending this ring to health-minded individuals honing their workout and recovery regimen. Plus, unlike Oura, the Ultrahuman Ring Air doesn't come with the price of a monthly subscription.\\u00a0Redditors say the Ultrahuman Ring Air is on par with Oura, but the rings aren't as effective at fitness tracking as a smartwatch or chest strap. The care and drive for improvement with this ring is palpable: Upon reading user reviews on Reddit, I've noticed that Ultrahuman's founder, Mohit Kumar, is on these threads interacting with users who leave reviews or ask questions about the product -- not something I've seen before.\\u00a0Ultrahuman Ring Air specs:\\u00a0Sizing:\\u00a05-14 |\\u00a0Material:\\u00a0Titanium coated with Tungsten Carbide Carbon |\\u00a0Colors: Matte grey, Aster black, space silver, bionic gold\\u00a0|\\u00a0Water resistance:\\u00a0Up to 330 feet |\\u00a0Sensors: Infrared Photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor, Non-contact medical-grade skin temperature sensor, 6-axis motion sensors, Red LEDs (heart rate monitoring and oxygen saturation) Green LEDs (heart rate monitoring) Infrared LEDs (heart rate monitoring) |\\u00a0Connectivity:\\u00a0Bluetooth Low-Energy |\\u00a0Battery:\\u00a0Up to six days   View now at Amazon    Samsung Galaxy Ring Best fitness ring for Android users    Prakhar Khanna/ZDNET  Pros & Cons  Pros  Automatic workout detection  Subscription-free  Extensive sleep tracking Cons  Only Android-accessible  Most expensive option on the list (but doesn't have an additional subscription) More Details  Let me introduce you to the newest smart ring in the game and the first smart ring released by a leading tech brand. The Galaxy Ring was released in July, and it's a wearable any Android user -- that's right, no iOS compatibility on this ring -- could get excited about.\\u00a0The Galaxy Ring is similar to many of the smart rings on this list in terms of features and functions, with a few fun exceptions. Like other rings, you're getting sleep and activity tracking. The Galaxy Ring uses an AI algorithm to determine your sleep quality, patterns, and more, and offers up a sleep score every morning that sums up your night's sleep. There's snoring analysis, movement during sleep, sleep latency, and heart and respiratory rate tracking.\\u00a0Also: Samsung Galaxy Ring hands-on: I asked for four features, and I got themAll this data is collected and stored through the Samsung Health app, which Android users can access (and Apple users... can't). This also means that iPhone users can't use the Galaxy Ring with their phone, unless they make the Android switch. Another benefit of having the Galaxy Ring within the Samsung ecosystem is that you can record workouts on a Samsung Galaxy smartwatch and log your sleep on the smart ring, then have all your data stored together. You can still use the ring for activity logging too, as Samsung offers features to support activity, like energy scores, inactive alerts, and automatic workout detection.\\u00a0One new feature that's novel to the smart ring space (and the rings on this list) is the double pinch gesture you can perform with the ring on your pointer finger. This feature snoozes alarms and snaps photos, all through the pinch of your fingers.\\u00a0Given how new the product is, we haven't had the chance to test this ring extensively yet, so wait for our full review in the coming weeks and months. But even before the review comes out, we predict that the ring could become one of the major players in the smart ring space.\\u00a0Galaxy Ring tech specs: Material:\\u00a0Titanium |\\u00a0Battery life: Seven days |\\u00a0Sizing:\\u00a0Five - 13 |\\u00a0Compatibility:\\u00a0Android: |\\u00a0Durability:\\u00a010ATM waterproof rating\\u00a0|\\u00a0Charging:\\u00a0Charging case   View now at AmazonView now at Best Buy  more buying choices   RingConn Smart Ring Best budget smart ring    Matthew Miller/ZDNET  Pros & Cons  Pros  Charger can power your ring for up to 150 days  No fees attached to ring  Helpful features and insights Cons  No readiness score  Doesn't integrate other health data like Apple, Garmin, or Polar More Details  RingConn offers the best of Oura without the hefty subscription fee. The RingConn smart ring has an upfront cost of $279, and that's it. The ring comes with a portable charging case that contains a 500 mAh charger, capable of charging the ring's battery for up to 150 days.When ZDNET's Matt Miller reviewed the ring, he complimented RingConn's stress tracking features and wellness balance feature, which assesses sleep, activity, vital signs, and stress to get a more holistic picture of your health. Miller was so impressed with the suite of features that he considered switching to RingConn as his primary smart ring over the Oura Ring.\\u00a0Review:\\u00a0RingConn Smart Ring\\\"I was much more impressed with the RingConn Smart Ring than I expected to be;\\u00a0 it's great to see such compelling competition in the smart ring space,\\\" Miller said.

Movano claims that the ring can even \\\"mood track.\\\" The ring can predict menstrual cycles and ovulation through its skin temperature sensors, providing an additional layer of insight into women's health. Evie's mood and symptom-tracking features are the most comprehensive I've tried out of all the smart rings I've worn.\\u00a0Also: Evie RingThe app's user interface is fun and quirky. Evie is trying to appeal to a younger female audience with its graphics, data delivery, and app language. Out of all the rings I've worn, this is by far the most stylish. Its arrow-like design stands out against the other rings, and I've received a few compliments on it. This is a ring designed for young, trendy, and health-data-driven women.\\u00a0In addition to its unique features, the Evie Ring offers a standard activity profile, displaying total steps taken, continuous movement stats, and calorie output. You don't get sleep, activity, or recovery scores, which is a bummer since those ratings can help you easily understand your slumber or workout. I use it to record my workouts, where it can document your heart rate, distance, step count, duration, and calories burned. However, because the battery life is shorter, certain features are closed off if the battery is too low, so you'll want to charge the ring before logging your workouts and performing spot checks. \\u00a0Movano Evie Ring\\u00a0specs: Sizing:\\u00a05-11\\u00a0|\\u00a0Material:\\u00a0Liquid metal\\u00a0|\\u00a0Colors: Silver, rose gold, gold\\u00a0|\\u00a0Water resistance:\\u00a0Up to 1 meter\\u00a0|\\u00a0Sensors: Heart rate, heart rate variability, SpO\\u2082, skin temperature, and active metabolic calorie burn |\\u00a0Connectivity:\\u00a0Bluetooth\\u00a0|\\u00a0Battery:\\u00a0Around four days   View now at Movano    What is the best fitness ring?

Additionally, the Oura Ring tracks steps and active calories, and it is equipped with heart rate sensors to monitor workout progress. Plus, it pairs with Strava to sync your running data. Unfortunately, it comes with a subscription.\\u00a0Ultrahuman Ring AirA subscription-free smart ring designed for fitness junkies and anyone who wants to optimize their workout and recovery. The helpful AI in the app provides recommendations on when to consume caffeine, when to stretch your legs after a workout, and what to eat to prevent glucose spikes.Samsung Galaxy RingA smart ring for Android users with extensive sleep tracking, automatic workout detection, and a few special touches, like a double pinch gesture to take photos or snooze alarms. This is a subscription-free smart ring, despite it being the most expensive up-front ring on the list. Ringconn Smart RingA budget alternative to the Oura Ring with many of the same features and no additional subscription. The ring offers stress tracking and wellness features for a holistic picture of your health. Our reviewer even said he was considering swapping his Oura Ring for the RingConn ring.Movano Evie RingA fitness ring built for women. It uses skin sensors to track menstrual cycles and ovulation, gives insight on emotional states, and provides the standard activity profile that tracks total steps, movement, and calorie output. This is the most aesthetically appealing ring on the list, but its battery life is the least competitive.     Factors to consider when choosing the best fitness ring:      Before you purchase a fitness ring, you should consider the following important factors.Price: A good fitness ring is going to cost you a chunk of money. Most fitness rings are around $250 to $450, depending on the brand and the material you get (the silver and slate colors tend to cost less than the gold and rose gold colors). Some rings also require a monthly subscription.Battery: If you are paying $300 for a ring, it should last you at least four or five days. Most of the competitive rings on the market last longer than that, at around six or seven.\\u00a0In-app experience: Because smart rings don't have screens, the ring is only as good as its app is for delivering helpful information. You should get everything you need to know packed in your app, like sleep, activity, and recovery data. The app should be easy to use, and the best apps offer insightful articles on how to get further use out of your ring.\\u00a0Comfort and wear: Because this is going around your finger, the fitness ring needs to be comfortable to wear, especially as you sleep, move, or exercise.\\u00a0Data delivery:\\u00a0The fitness ring should deliver health data that you can understand even if you aren't a medical pro.\\u00a0     How did we test these fitness rings?      I went hands-on with most of the fitness rings on this list to consider whether the rings I included were worth their expensive price.\\u00a0Three fitness rings are on my hands right now as I write this. In my testing, I shower, cook, clean, exercise, and socialize with these rings on, and I observe how my activity impacts the data of each ring and how the rings compare to one another. Plus, as a half marathon trainer, I run four times a week and use my rings to aggregate my health data as I exercise, so you can trust that I have put these rings through the ultimate test and ran many miles with them on.\\u00a0Also:\\u00a0How we test smart rings at ZDNETWe test these fitness rings in real-world situations focusing on features, design and comfort, performance, battery life, and overall value. For products we recommend, we write a product spotlight review that we update periodically with new features and pricing information.     What are fitness rings and how do they work?      A fitness ring is also known as a smart ring. Unlike smartwatches that go on your wrist, smart rings are worn\\u00a0around your finger to monitor your health and activity. It uses sensors and special chips to track and store your information. Some models offer water resistance so you can wear them as you swim, while others provide alerts via vibration for alarms, personal reminders, and more.\\u00a0     Are smart rings good for exercise?       That depends on the sort of exercise you perform. For running, cycling, yoga, HIIT, and other cardio-heavy activities, a smart ring works swell. But for weight training, rock climbing, or any workout where the smart ring could obstruct your grip, you might want to opt for a smart watch instead.\\u00a0     What do smart rings do?      Similar to smartwatches, smart rings track your health data through the sensors embedded inside the ring. Unlike smartwatches, they are far more discreet and don't have a screen. Most of the data that is collected on a smart ring is viewable on its companion app, where the ring-wearer can learn insights into their sleep, stress levels, and daily activity.\\u00a0     Is Oura or Ultrahuman better as a fitness ring?      That depends on what you want out of your smart fitness ring. I've tested both and can say that each ring serves different people and purposes, but their data collection methods are similar. The Oura ring is a general smart ring that works well for fitness due to its advanced features. I don't think anyone would have a problem wearing this ring. I love how many apps are compatible with Oura and how simple it is to use. For example, I can go for a run or play tennis, and I don't have to open the app and log my activities, as Oura can naturally detect my activities. However, you need to log activities on the Ultrahuman companion app.\\u00a0Ultrahuman appeals to the serious fitness junkies who want to optimize their body for fitness. The data that Ultrahuman collects on my sleep is similar to Oura's data. Ultrahuman's purpose isn't to appeal to everyone, unlike Oura. It appeals to people who are willing to optimize their day for their fitness schedule, by allowing their natural adenosine to flush out before drinking a cup of coffee in the morning, logging their calories, and receiving AI-powered insights about how to avoid glucose spikes.\\u00a0     Is an Oura Ring better than an Apple Watch?      That really depends on if you're a watch person or a ring person. The Apple Watch lets you see all your stats on the watch itself and has features like texting and streaming music.\\u00a0On the other hand, the Oura Ring is more of an ambient technology that you forget you're wearing. You have to go into the app to get your stats, and it doesn't have any fancy notifications. However, the Oura Ring will track your sleep more accurately than the Apple Watch, and it's comparable to Apple Watch's activity tracking.     Are fitness rings accurate in tracking activity, sleep, and other health metrics?      Fitness rings can provide reasonably accurate data on health metrics like heart rate, steps taken, and sleep patterns. However, the accuracy of each metric can vary depending on the specific device and the quality of the sensors used. It's essential to choose a fitness ring with reliable sensor technology and to keep in mind that no wearable device can provide perfect accuracy in tracking health metrics.     Other fitness rings we tested      The fitness ring market is small, but it is growing. There aren't many other options to choose from at the moment, but here are a few other smart rings we've tested alongside the options above.\\u00a0   View at Us.amazfitView at WalmartZDNET Recommends    \\n\\n          The best smartwatches you can buy: Apple, Samsung, Google, and more compared\\n         \\n\\n          The 5 best VPN services (and tips to choose the right one for you)\\n         \\n\\n          The best Android phones you can buy (including a surprise pick)\\n         \\n\\n          The best robot vacuum and mop combos (and if they're worth the money)\\n            \\n\\n            The best smartwatches you can buy: Apple, Samsung, Google, and more compared\\n           \\n\\n            The 5 best VPN services (and tips to choose the right one for you)\\n           \\n\\n            The best Android phones you can buy (including a surprise pick)\\n           \\n\\n            The best robot vacuum and mop combos (and if they're worth the money)\\n           Editorial standards  Show Comments  \\n          Log In to Comment\\n         Community Guidelines     Related   \\n      The best smart rings you can buy: Expert tested\\n      \\n      The best bone conduction headphones you can buy: Expert tested\\n      \\n      The best Apple Watches you can buy: Expert tested\\n              ZDNET we equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.Cupertino, California-based Apple remained No 1 in that market in the first quarter, despite a decline in sales of the Apple Watch and AirPods during the period, according to research firm IDC's wearables shipment report published last month.IDC said Xiaomi, Huawei Technologies and Samsung ranked behind Apple in global wearable device shipments.Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Ring provides sleep analysis and a sleep artificial intelligence algorithm to help users understand their rest patterns and build better habits.

Photo: Samsung>Shanghai resident and long-time iPhone user Jiang Jiayi, 30, said he is among those mainland consumers considering to buy the Galaxy Ring.\\\"It's a lighter-weight option for health tracking, and I'm quite curious to know up to what degree it can replace smartwatches [for that purpose],\\\" he said.Samsung set the price of its smart ring on the mainland at 3,099 yuan (US$425), according to Chinese media. The company, however, labelled the gadget as \\\"out of stock\\\" on its China website as of Thursday afternoon.Some mainland consumers have already complained about the Galaxy Ring's price. \\\"It looks pretty cool,\\\" wrote Weibo user \\\"qzc\\\" in a post on the Chinese microblogging platform on Thursday.Story continues\\\"But I'll only consider [buying such a product] if any domestic company follows up [with a smart ring of its own].\\\"Before the Galaxy Ring's launch, Chinese consumers have shown interest in smart rings from some smaller vendors such as Oura, Ultrahuman and RingConn.A sustained local demand for the Galaxy Ring would count as a success for Samsung on the mainland, where it once was the biggest smartphone vendor with a 20 per cent market share in 2013.The Korean firm ranked dead last among the market's major handset vendors by 2018, with just a 1 per cent share, and has since remained around that level.Samsung Electronics launched its latest portfolio of smart wearable devices on July 10. These include the Galaxy Ring in three colour options, the Galaxy Watch7 (centre) and the Galaxy Watch Ultra.

Apple has yet to make an announcement on this new wearables segment.Chinese smartphone vendor Honor, a Huawei spin-off, also revealed in February that it was developing a smart ring after Samsung announced initial details about the Galaxy Ring during the MWC Barcelona trade show that same month.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

Nonetheless, current material forming technologies face challenges due to internal stress and defects, resulting in a substantial decline in both mechanical properties and processing precision. We herein develop a processing strategy toward graphene superstructure with a curvature gradient, which allows us to fabricate robust structural materials with meticulously designed functional shapes. The structure consists of an arc-shaped assembly of graphene nanosheets positioned at co-axial curvature centers. During the dehydration-based evaporate-casting process, the assembly is tightened via capillary effect, inducing local bending. By precisely tuning the axis-center distance and tilt angle, we achieve accurate control over the shape of obtained structure. Notably, internal stress is harnessed to reinforce a designed mortise and tenon structure, resulting in a high joining strength of up to ~200\\u2009MPa. This innovative approach addresses the challenges faced by current material forming technologies and opens up more possibilities for the manufacturing of robust and precisely shaped components. Through precise adjustments to the curvature gradient inherent in stacked graphene assembly walls, a highly controllable water casting process for self-shaping with an accuracy of ca. 10\\u2009\\u03bcm is demonstrated for making shaped functional materials.\",\n          \"language\": \"en\"\n        },\n        \"page_content\": \"\\n\\n\\nEvaporate-casting of curvature gradient graphene superstructures for ultra-high strength structural materials | Nature Communications\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main content\\n\\n\\nThank you for visiting nature.com.

Nonetheless, current material forming technologies face challenges due to internal stress and defects, resulting in a substantial decline in both mechanical properties and processing precision. We herein develop a processing strategy toward graphene superstructure with a curvature gradient, which allows us to fabricate robust structural materials with meticulously designed functional shapes. The structure consists of an arc-shaped assembly of graphene nanosheets positioned at co-axial curvature centers. During the dehydration-based evaporate-casting process, the assembly is tightened via capillary effect, inducing local bending. By precisely tuning the axis-center distance and tilt angle, we achieve accurate control over the shape of obtained structure. Notably, internal stress is harnessed to reinforce a designed mortise and tenon structure, resulting in a high joining strength of up to ~200\\u2009MPa. This innovative approach addresses the challenges faced by current material forming technologies and opens up more possibilities for the manufacturing of robust and precisely shaped components.\\n\\n\\n\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUltrathin damage-tolerant flexible metal interconnects reinforced by in-situ graphene synthesis\\n                                        \\n\\n\\nArticle\\nOpen access\\n08 March 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContinuous crystalline graphene papers with gigapascal strength by intercalation modulated plasticization\\n                                        \\n\\n\\nArticle\\nOpen access\\n27 May 2020\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditive manufacturing of micro-architected metals via hydrogel infusion\\n                                        \\n\\n\\nArticle\\n20 October 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroductionStructural material processing plays crucial roles in virtually all aspects of modern manufacturing and industry, enabling the fabrication of customized, complex, and precision parts that are durable and well-suited for various applications, spanning from electronics to aerospace and automotive industries1,2,3. However, current material forming technologies suffer from internal stress or defects arising from the relative displacement of material molecules (or atoms) during the processing, which lead to a noteworthy attenuation of the intrinsic mechanical properties and a deterioration of processing precision4,5,6. In line with the development of two-dimensional materials over the past decades, microstructures constructed from graphene and its derivatives as basic building blocks have showcased tremendous potential, demonstrating that the bottom-up self-assembly is an effective strategy to address the processing challenge7,8. Through the deliberate regulation of interactions between graphene sheets, such as \\u03c0-\\u03c0 interaction and hydrogen bonding, one can achieve designed structures encompassing porous structure (Fig.\\u00a01a-i)9,10, layered structure (Fig.\\u00a01a-ii)11,12, or array structure (Fig.\\u00a01a-iii)13,14. To alter the assembly\\u2019s configuration and attain desired structural materials, an external force is necessary, while the resulting internal stress can be dissipated by relative slip between sheets. Nevertheless, random interlayer slippage of nanosheets in the above three assemblies will lead to unpredictable changes, and thus defects, in the resultant structure.Fig. 1: Conceptual illustrations of evaporate-casting of cg-G.a Graphene platelet derived from monolayer graphene nanosheets as basic building block for graphene-based functional architectures shown in i to iv: (i) porous structure, (ii) layered structure, (iii) array structure, and (iv) curvature gradient superstructure.

The two layers deem to be one curvature step. d Dehydration and evaporate-casting process of cg-G. The assembly is tightened by capillary action during water evaporating, and the curvature exhibits a gradient change, resulting in local bending driven by internal configurational force.Full size imageThe gradient structures are introduced as a groundbreaking conceptual design, demonstrating that despite relatively low precision, the internal stress inherent in material forming can still be effectively harnessed to regulate the shapes of the resulting products. Owing to the well-organized structure along the gradient direction, including the gradient of functional groups (known as chemical gradient)15 and gradient of pores (i.e., physical gradient)16, stress generated during material forming induces differential deformation at various positions within the material, achieving the shaping. Although the gradient structures are innovative in dissipating internal stress for high robustness, it still constitutes an emerging technology, presenting challenges in utilizing internal stress as a driving force for shaping process.We demonstrate here the fabrication of a graphene superstructure with curvature gradient (cg-G), and present a processing strategy to construct strong structural material with designed functional shapes. The structure comprises a circular arc-shaped assembly of graphene nanosheets positioned at co-axial curvature centers (Fig.\\u00a01a-iv). Our inspiration draws from the curvature junctions observed within the layered cells of a bean pod (Fig.\\u00a01b)17,18,19. The curvature arises as a result of the asymmetrical shrinkage of two layers during the dehydration process, ultimately inducing internal stresses that enhance the structural strength of the entire assembly while also driving deformation (Fig.\\u00a01c)20,21. Water molecules act as molecular-level plasticizers, engaging with the oxygen-containing functional groups on the graphene nanosheets through hydrogen bonding, thus imparting mobility to the graphene nanosheets. The assembly is tightened by capillary action during the dehydration-based evaporate-casting process, and the curvature also exhibits a gradient change, consequently inducing local bending driven by internal stress (Fig.\\u00a01d). Through controllable coordination of axis-center distance and tilt angle, we can exert accurate control over the shape of the resulting casting. Remarkably, in designed mortise and tenon structure, internal stress can be leveraged to reinforce the formation, leading to the attainment of a super high-strength connection (~200\\u2009MPa) upon a specific strength of 143\\u2009MPa\\u2009cm3\\u2009g\\u22121, surpassing that of metallic welding connection, or even integrally formed alloys. The entire process is characterized by its high level of controllability, feasibility, cost-effectiveness, versatility, and environmentally friendly attributes.ResultsFabrication and characterization of cg-G\\ncg-G is produced through an alkaline-assisted hydrothermal synthesis using graphene oxide (GO) as precursor (see Methods for details, Supplementary Figs.\\u00a01 and 2). The graphene walls are aligned around the geometric axis, which concurrently serves as the axis of curvature of the obtained structure. Using laser processing technology, one can shape the materials with exceptional precision, achieving accuracy of ca. 10 micrometers when combined with an evaporate-casting process (Fig.\\u00a02a and Supplementary Fig.\\u00a03). The resultant superstructure is featured with a curvature gradient (Fig.\\u00a02b), where the curvature is smaller further from the curvature center and increases as one approaches the center. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations demonstrate that the structure at point a (farther from the curvature center) shows a nearly align parallel to the central axis of curvature (Fig.\\u00a02c), while the one at point b (near to the curvature center) exhibits neat remarkable curved arrays toward the concentric axis. The side view cross-section at point c (parallel to the curvature central axis) shows a similar parallel structure to the one at point a (Fig.\\u00a02d).Fig. 2: Morphology and structure characterizations of cg-G.a Photograph of a cuboid-shaped cg-G. b Schematic structure of cg-G.

Source data are provided as a source data file.Full size imageIn a swelling state, the gaps amidst the walls become saturated with water molecules. The evaporate-casting process generates capillary forces through water evaporation, drawing the flat graphene assembly and yielding the protruding structures (Fig.\\u00a02e, Supplementary Figs.\\u00a04 and 5). Analysis via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates an oxygen composition of approximately 20% within the cg-G, affirming the presence of hydrophilic oxygen functional groups (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a06a). This observation emphasizes a robust interaction between water and the internal surfaces, thereby ensuring the potency of the capillary forces. Both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy before and after water evaporation indicate that the casting process does not alter the composition or content of functional groups on graphene sheets (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a06b, d, e). Additionally, X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrate no discernible peak shift between the dehydrated and hydrated states (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a06c), signifying a consistent interlayer structure connecting the two graphene nanosheets within the assemblies. This suggests that the protruding structures retain the intrinsic mechanical attributes of the graphene assembly. Upon complete dehydration, an aligned microstructure is observed under scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), wherein the protrusions are mechanically interlocked in a serrated configuration (Fig.\\u00a02f, Supplementary Fig.\\u00a07). Due to this distinctive structure, cg-G after deformation demonstrates a density of ~1.5\\u2009g\\u2009cm\\u22123 and high compressive strength of up to 70\\u2009MPa/(g/cm3), surpassing that of various metals including stainless steel (SUS304) and doubling the strength of traditional graphene-based structural materials (Fig.\\u00a02g, Supplementary Fig.\\u00a08).Controllable shaping based on curvature gradientTo achieve precise control over curvature gradients, we utilized the distance (d) extending from the geometric center (O) of the samples to the curvature axis of the superstructure (O\\u2019) as a governing parameter (Fig.\\u00a03a, 3b-i). In situations where the curvature axis of the graphene superstructure is perpendicular to the plane of the cross-shaped samples, variations in the distribution of curvature gradients within the sample result in diverse bending behaviors during the evaporate-casting process (Fig.\\u00a03b-ii and 3b-iii, Supplementary Figs.\\u00a09 and 10, Supplementary Video\\u00a01). The deformation of samples with diverse curvature gradients can be anticipated via computational prediction (see Methods for details). While the level of shrinkage is notably high, the overall form of the cross-shaped samples is upheld when d\\u2009=\\u20090. This phenomenon arises due to the counteraction of configurational forces in these sections, which is a consequence of the symmetric microstructures aligning along the in-plane direction. In contrast, the prominence of the differential distribution of the shrinkage coefficient amplifies as d increases (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a011). In this context, the degree of shrinkage escalates alongside a more substantial curvature gradient. As a result, these cross-shaped cg-Gs exhibit in-plane deformations toward the curvature center direction following the process of evaporate-casting.Fig. 3: In-plane and out-plane evaporate-casting processing of cg-G.a\\u2013c In-plane processing. a Schematic diagrams of cross-shaped cg-G with an axis-center distance (d) perpendicular to centric axis of curvature. b Demonstrations of cross-shaped cg-Gs with different microstructures before and after deformation: (i) Schematic diagrams of three cross-shaped cg-G with different d values (d\\u2009=\\u20090, 3, 7\\u2009mm) on in-plane direction. (ii) Gradient distribution of the curvatures and theoretical predictions of the deformation of the three cg-Gs based on finite element analysis (FEA). (iii) SEM images of the three deformed cg-Gs.

(ii) Corresponding gradient distribution of the curvatures and theoretical predictions of the deformation of the three cg-Gs based on FEA. (iii) SEM images of the three deformed cg-Gs.

Source data are provided as a source data file.Full size imageThe microscopic observation via SEM (Fig.\\u00a03b-iii) experimentally validated the correlation between deflection and curvature gradient. Samples with a carefully designed curvature gradient exhibited corresponding bending angles (\\u03b1e) along the longer sides (the long side of the initial cross-shaped cg-G) that aligned with the values derived from computational predictions (\\u03b1c) (Fig.\\u00a03b-ii, Supplementary Fig.\\u00a09b). This alignment suggests a high level of uniformity in the self-deformation facilitated by the curvature gradient. The lateral dimension, which signifies the extent of the long side of the initial cross-shaped cg-G after deformation, is utilized to exemplify the pronounced regularity of self-deformation. Notably, despite the progressive augmentation in the curvature gradient, the lateral length remains invariant (Fig.\\u00a03c). The alterations in shape along the horizontal direction are relies on the decreasing gap width of the wall structures. As a result, the constant lateral dimension not only denotes a consistent curvature gradient but also a contraction that closely approximates the characteristics of an ideal coaxial circular arc model (see Supplementary Fig.\\u00a012 for details), which concurs with the structural characterization elucidated in Fig.\\u00a02. More examples of the in-plane deformation are shown in Supplementary Figs.\\u00a013 and 14.We also examined a scenario where the axis of curvature is parallel to the plane of the cross-shape specimen, and we denoted the distance between the geometric center point and the curvature axis as d (Fig.\\u00a03d, 3e-i). The deformation induced by the evaporate-casting process was simulated computationally (Fig.\\u00a03e-ii, Supplementary Fig.\\u00a015a). Despite the significant contraction (high shrinkage coefficient level), the fundamental configuration of the cross-shaped samples remains unaltered when d\\u2009=\\u20090. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the equilibrium between internal stresses within symmetric microstructures. The distribution of the shrinkage coefficient becomes more pronounced as the curvature gradient increases (Fig.\\u00a03e-iii), signifying that the relationship between the degree of out-plane bending and curvature gradient mirrors that of in-plane deformation. Additionally, a distinct out-plane deformation becomes evident, aligning with the computational predictions. The independence of the lateral length on the curvature gradient underscores the nearly ideal arrangement of co-axial circular arc-shaped graphene assemblies, reinforcing the concordance between observations and expectations (Fig.\\u00a03f, Supplementary Fig.\\u00a015b). The consistency of these phenomena with the results of in-plane deformation experiments highlights satisfactory controllability facilitated by the curvature gradient in self-shaping processes.Mechanism of self-shapingThe evaporate-casting enabled self-shaping relies on the hierarchical deformation of graphene walls. Water molecules serve as plasticizers, enabling relative sliding of graphene nanosheets within the walls. In this context, as water within surface wrinkles evaporates, capillary forces prompt each graphene nanosheet to crumple (Fig.\\u00a04a). Consequently, protrusions emerge on the dehydrated wall surfaces (Fig.\\u00a02e, f), causing shrinkage along the plane of the wall. It\\u2019s worth noting that due to robust \\u03c0-\\u03c0 interaction forces between graphene sheets, the crumpled walls retain their form even when in contact with water. On an assembly scale, capillary forces exert a tautening effect on the wall structures, diminishing gap sizes and hence yielding a compact arrangement (Fig.\\u00a04b). The emergence of protrusions and the constriction of wall structures collectively bring about macroscopic shape contraction in orthogonal directions. This behavior can be reflected on a cuboid sample comprising a centrosymmetric curvature gradient microstructure (Fig.\\u00a04c, Supplementary Figs.\\u00a016 and 17). The ratio of contraction along the wall plane (l\\u2019) compared to that perpendicular to the wall plane (w\\u2019) was measured at 1.4, indicating the anisotropic contraction behavior that could significantly bolster the efficacy of the curvature gradient induced deformation. This casting method demonstrates high stability. The ratio of l\\u2019/w\\u2019 is determined by the microstructure of cg-G (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a018), and remains unaffected by the surrounding environment during water evaporation (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a019).Fig. 4: Mechanism of evaporate-casting of cg-G.a Schematic of capillary force (Pc) of water in the groove of a monolayer graphene sheet, and the deformation of graphene groove after dehydration. The capillary force acts perpendicular to the water surface and can be divided into two force modes: one is normal to the graphene sheet (Fx) and the other is along the sheet (Fy). b Schematic of the dehydration process of graphene walls arrayed in parallel during evaporate-casting. c Photographs of cuboid-shaped cg-G comprising a centrosymmetric curvature gradient structure after dehydration of 0\\u2009h and 5\\u2009h, and the corresponding SEM image of dehydration for 5\\u2009h.

After being twisted, the direction towards the curvature center (blue arrow) shifts from in-plane to out-plane. h Digital photos and SEM images of three cg-G assemblies with a twisted angle of 0o (i), 10o (ii), and 30o (iii) before and after evaporate-casting.Full size imageThen we delve into how the self-tightening effect of cg-Gs during the evaporate-casting process is harnessed to programmatically transform simple profiles into intricate structures. According to the Kelvin curvature effect22, water molecules are more likely to escape from curved surfaces. This observation aligns with our experimental findings that water evaporates more rapidly from the side with larger curvature. With water evaporating, moisture near highly curved graphene sheets becomes depleted first, leading to more pronounced deformations compared to regions with lower curvature. Considering these mechanisms, we can postulate the following relationship between radial strain (\\u03b5r, strain towards the center of the curvature) and curvature radius (\\u03c1) of cg-G during evaporate-casting:$${\\\\varepsilon }_{r}={\\\\varepsilon }_{0}+{bf}(\\\\rho )({\\\\varepsilon }_{r}\\\\, < \\\\, 0)$$\\n                    (1)\\n                where \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{0}\\\\) (<0) represents the uniform shrinkage strain (the curvature radius equals zero). \\\\(b\\\\) (>0) is the curvature deformation coefficient, indicating the sensitivity of deformation to changes in curvature radius. f(\\u03c1) is a function of \\u03c1, signifying that as the curvature radius increases, the shrinkage deformation decreases. In this study, when analyzing cg-G slices consists of graphene walls positioned at co-axial curvature centers (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a020), we assumed a relationship between \\u03b5r and \\u03c1, i.e., \\u03b5r\\u2009=\\u2009\\u03b50\\u2009+\\u2009b\\u03c12 (see Supplementary text for details). Specifically, the curvature microstructures of cg-G slices can be described by their d and \\u03b8 values. Based on above relationship, we investigated the deformation of cg-G with different d and \\u03b8, and provided corresponding analytical expressions (see Supplementary text for details). Theoretical results not only effectively accord with the deformation states discussed in Fig.\\u00a03, but also accurately predict deformations of dumbbell-shaped cg-Gs (see Figs. 21\\u201323 for a detailed discussion). For example, the FEA results and SEM images reveal that the dumbbell architecture (Fig. 4d,\\u00a0with a \\u03b8 value of 45\\u00b0) presents twists around the long center axis after deformation (Fig.\\u00a04e, f), resulting in a stereo and centrosymmetric final geometry, and bilateral cuboids transformed to be approximate trapezoidal cube due to the in-plane deformation. These results validate the mechanism of curvature gradient-induced bending deformation.Apart from the self-shaping cg-G structures that can be predicted and understood through having defined the relevant \\u03b8 and d parameters, this behavior can be further programmed through external force which allows the assembly to exhibit self-plastic capability like metals. To demonstrate this point, we applied two forces of equal magnitude and opposite direction on both ends of an arc-shaped cg-G (Fig.\\u00a04g), resulting in the initial twist deformations with different bending angles, such as a small angle of 10\\u00b0 (Fig.\\u00a04g-ii) and a large angle of 30\\u00b0 (Fig.\\u00a04g-iii), respectively. After deformation, the direction towards the curvature center (blue arrow) shifts from in-plane to out-plane. The coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) calculation model show that the energy of the system initially increases and then decreases as raise of twist angles because of inter-adhered graphene walls driven by strong \\u03c0\\u2013\\u03c0 interactions (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a024). As the degree of deformation intensifies, the quantity of adhering walls escalates, causing a continual reduction in the system\\u2019s energy. When the energy drops below zero, the system achieves stability, and the structure displays plasticity, enabling it to preserve the shape shaped by external forces (Fig.\\u00a04g-ii, iii).The cg-G slices can be shaped due to their distinctive curvature gradient structures through evaporate-casting. As water evaporates, all arc-shaped cg-G architectures are expected to undergo alterations in their initial profiles (Fig.\\u00a04h). The one with symmetrical curvature center structure transformed into a closed-loop structure during the evaporate-casting process (Fig.\\u00a04h-i), aligning with the previously mentioned self-shaping principles. When subjected to additional forces with initial twist angles of 10\\u00b0 (Fig.\\u00a04h-ii) and 30\\u00b0 (Fig.\\u00a04h-iii), the direction pointing towards the center of curvature changed, signifying the existence of out-of-plane components of the asymmetry within the curvature structure. The changes directly resulted further structural deformations out of plane. In SEM images, two helix-shaped cg-G architectures with the same deformation mode but different pitches can be observed, and the twist angle is larger than it before deformation. These deformations resulted from the configurational forces generated by the combined effects of the initial curvature gradient and the additional twist angle during dehydration. These results confirm the previously established deformation mechanism.Enhanced mechanical strength through hierarchical self-tighteningWe constructed a gasket structure (Fig.\\u00a05a), aligning the curvature center axis with the geometric center axis, to investigate the self-tightening effect induced by evaporate-casting across a highly symmetric curvature gradient. Impressively, when five micro-fixators were placed between two thick stainless steel plates (Fig.\\u00a05b), the assembly could withstand nearly one ton of weight as exemplified by a car (weighing ~1200\\u2009kg) running over on the top (Fig.\\u00a05c). Throughout the compression process, the gasket structure remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a025), while distinct indentations appeared on the stainless steel plate (Fig.\\u00a05d), underscoring the superior strength of the gasket structure in comparison to stainless steel. By taking virtue from self-deformation behaviors induced by curvature gradient structures, we showed that various preset architectures could be accurately constructed, such as a blooming flower-like configuration (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a026a\\u2013c). Additionally, the macroscopic-scale self-tightening is demonstrated by the mortise and tenon structure. We employed asymmetric shrinkage to craft samples featuring mortise structures (Fig.\\u00a05e). For the tenon structure, we positioned the curvature center axis at the center of the mortise circle. This arrangement enabled the tenon structure to display an inward deformation tendency during the coupling process with evaporate-casting, ultimately achieving a macroscopic self-tightening effect. Upon examining the microscopic morphology of the joint, we observed slight deformation in the shoulder part of the mortise structure (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a026d), indicating the centripetal deformation inherent in the tenon structure. A tight juncture of the mortise and tenon structures revealed by the SEM investigation further confirmed the self-locking behavior (Fig.\\u00a05f, Supplementary Fig.\\u00a026e). Remarkably, a self-tightening mortise and tenon configuration, measuring merely 1 cubic millimeter in volume, demonstrated the capacity to lift a weight weighing 300,000 times its own mass (Fig.\\u00a05g, Supplementary Video\\u00a02). Its specific tensile strength reached up to 143\\u2009MPa\\u2009cm3\\u2009g\\u22121 (Fig.\\u00a05h, Supplementary Figs.\\u00a027 and 28), comparable to welded metals23,24, and far superior to various types of connectors including self-healing polymer25,26,27, and 3D printed structures28,29,30 (Supplementary Table\\u00a01). Energy utilization can also be calculated through the thermal transfer power during the material preparation process, and the mechanically interlocked structure exhibits values that are 1 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of the aforementioned contrast materials (the calculation of energy utilization is detailed in Supplementary Information). Concurrently, its substantial materials and size expandability, and adaptability serve to position it as a promising, innovative, and eco-friendly technology for structural connections (Supplementary Figs.\\u00a029 and 30).Fig. 5: Mechanical strength and demonstrations of cg-Gs after evaporate-casting.a Schematic and optical images of cuboid-shaped cg-G with circular void in the middle after evaporate-casting.

Source data are provided as a source data file.Full size imageThe evaporate-casting of curvature gradient graphene superstructures presented herein allow for the controllable fabrication of graphene micro-architectures with diverse designed functional shapes and high mechanical strength. With the controllable design of uniform arc-shaped assembly of graphene nanosheets positioned at co-axial curvature centers, configurational force pointed to the center of curvature generated during dehydration. As a result, the assembly is tightened during the dehydration-based evaporate-casting process via capillary force, inducing local bending. Through precisely tuning the axis-center distance and tilt angle, we realized accurate control over the shape of obtained evaporate-casting structure. In addition, mortise and tenon structure is induced to this work and the internal stress can be leveraged to reinforce the formation, leading to a high-strength connection (~200\\u2009MPa), surpassing that of multiple materials with connection structures, and even welded metals. Compared with traditional welding technology, the proposed evaporate-casting processing can occur spontaneously at room temperature, greatly reduced the threshold and energy consumption of the combination reaction. The entire process is characterized by its high level of controllability, feasibility, cost-effectiveness, versatility, and environmentally friendly attributes.MethodsPreparation of the GO dispersionGO was prepared via the modified Hummers method31. Firstly, 10\\u2009g of graphite powder (mesh number: 200) and sodium nitrate (3\\u2009g) were added into a beaker (3\\u2009L) containing 260\\u2009mL of concentrated sulfur acid (98%), and stirred at 0\\u2009\\u00b0C for 2\\u2009h. Then, 30\\u2009g of potassium permanganate was carefully added under stirring, keep for 2\\u2009h. After that, the beaker was transferred to a constant temperature water bath of 35\\u2009\\u00b0C and kept for stirring for 1\\u2009h. Thereafter, 460\\u2009mL of cold deionized water was dropwise added into the mixture and kept at 98\\u2009\\u00b0C for 30\\u2009min. Additional 1\\u2009L of cold deionized water and 20\\u2009mL of hydrogen peroxide were poured into the solution. Finally, the product was centrifuged and washed by deionized water repeatedly until the pH changed from acidity to neutral, then the GO dispersion was produced.Fabrication of random graphene assemblyWe prepared graphene hydrogel with random structure through hydrothermal process with GO as precursor. Specially, 60\\u2009ml GO aqueous (3.5\\u2009mg\\u2009mL\\u22121) dispersion was added into a 100\\u2009ml Teflon-lined autoclave, and treated by a hydrothermal process (180\\u2009\\u00b0C for 6\\u2009h) in air oven, resulting in a normal cylindrical graphene hydrogel with random microstructures.Fabrication of cg-G\\n60\\u2009ml GO aqueous dispersion (3.5\\u2009mg\\u2009mL\\u22121) was added into a 100\\u2009ml Teflon-lined autoclave and add certain amount of alkali (e.g., ammonium hydroxide (the volume ratio of GO aqueous dispersion to ammonium hydroxide (concentration: 32%) is 60:1), potassium hydroxide (0.15\\u2009mol\\u2009L\\u22121)) under stirring. Keep stirring for 5\\u2009min and then treated by a hydrothermal process (180\\u2009\\u00b0C for 6\\u2009h) in air oven, resulting in a cylindrical graphene hydrogel with ordered concentric circle microstructures. Subsequently, the prepared hydrogel was immersed in 1\\u2009M HCl solution for 6\\u20138\\u2009h. After thoroughly rinsing to eliminate any lingering acid, the pure cg-G was obtained.After adding alkali, GO sheets could transform from disorder state into long-range oriented lamellar phases. Benefiting from the reaction between alkali and carboxyl on GO sheets, the hydrogen bond interaction between GO sheets decreased distinctly and electrostatic repulsion increased (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a01). Under following stirring process, GO sheets tuned their direction vector in real time and maintained an overall trend of parallel to each other. The outline of fabricated hydrogel is determined by the inner surface of reaction still because of the surface anchoring effect, as well as the aligned arrangement of GO sheets. Changing the lining shape of Teflon-lined autoclave, graphene assemblies with different geometry were prepared because of the surface anchoring effect, as well as the aligned arrangement of GO sheets. By adjusting the concentration of GO aqueous dispersion (1.5\\u2009mg\\u2009mL\\u22121, 2.5\\u2009mg\\u2009mL\\u22121, 3.5\\u2009mg\\u2009mL\\u22121, 4\\u2009mg\\u2009mL\\u22121) and varying the quantity of alkali used, graphene hydrogels with different structures can be prepared (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a02).cg-Gs were fabricated via sculpturing graphene hydrogel with concentric circle microstructures by an ultraviolet laser cutting system (LAJAMIN 3D laser) conducted by computer operation system. By adjusting both the axis-center distance (d) and the tilt angle (\\\\(\\\\theta\\\\): angle between the center axis of initial cylinder profile and the normal axis of target profile, changing from 0\\u00b0 to 90\\u00b0), a diverse range of cg-G can be fabricated.Fabrication of complex cg-G\\nFirst, arc-shaped cg-G is fabricated via sculpturing graphene hydrogel with concentric circle microstructures (\\u03b8\\u2009=\\u20090\\u00b0) by laser cutting system. Then, through the manipulation of one end of the arc structure while twisting the opposite end, external forces of equal magnitude but opposing directions can be simultaneously exerted at precise points on the target structure. By adjusting the twisting angle of the target structure, various complex cg-Gs can be created.Fabrication of cg-G architectures via evaporating-casting processPut as-prepared cg-G slices on a Teflon substrate with glazed surface. The surface of Teflon is super-hydrophobic, which can decrease the influence from the detect between substrate and hydrogel furthest. Standing the hydrogel in ambient atmosphere or convection oven (35\\u2009\\u00b0C\\u221265\\u2009\\u00b0C) for a certain time, and cg-G architectures could be prepared via shrinking and deforming spontaneously.CharacterizationThe morphologies of the samples were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU-8010). HADDF-STEM images were obtained by FEI TecnaiTF20 transmission electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was conducted on ULVAC-PHI PHI Quantro SXM X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. X-ray diffraction pattern was conducted on SmartLab multiple crystal X-ray spectrometer. Mechanical tests were carried out using a Shimadzu AGS-X. Optical images were acquired on ZEISS Axio Scope. The graphene hydrogel assembly was sculptured by a 355\\u2009nm ultraviolet laser cutting system (Beijing Lagamin Laser Co., LM-UVY-5S-Y) under ambient conditions.Finite element analysis (FEA)Due to the varying distances from the center, the curvature and the degree of contraction of the material differ at different locations. Considering the known micro-mechanisms, we have set up the following strain field in FEA, \\\\(\\\\varepsilon (x,\\\\, {y},\\\\, {z})={\\\\varepsilon }_{0}+b({x}^{2}\\\\,+{y}^{2})={\\\\varepsilon }_{0}+{{br}}^{2}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\varepsilon=0\\\\) at the outermost region. Among them, \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{0} \\\\, < \\\\, 0\\\\) represents the strain at the center, and \\\\(b \\\\, > \\\\, 0\\\\) the curvature deformation coefficient. The contraction deformation is maximum at the center. As moving toward the outer regions, the degree of contraction gradually decreases. It is worth noting that graphene is distributed in a ring shape within the x-y plane in the specimen, while it is approximately uniformly distributed along the z-direction. Therefore, uniform loading in the z-direction is set to reflect this characteristic. It is also noted that the change in water evaporation rate during the deformation of graphene hydrogels. Thus, the set strain rate decreases as the deformation increases.All of the above-introduced deformation fields are achieved through an equivalent temperature field and implemented within the finite element solver ABAQUS by using the user subroutine to define incremental strains. The overall finite element model was meshed with 8-node brick (C3D8) elements.Coarse grain molecular dynamics (MD) simulationCoarse grain molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is performed to uncover the deformation mechanism during shrinking process. In all models, each graphene sheet or platelet is depicted by coarse grain particles, which compose a square or rectangle sheet. According to Ref. [Steven Cranford], the total energy of graphene sheets or platelets could be written as$${\\\\phi }_{{tot}}={\\\\phi }_{T}+{\\\\phi }_{\\\\varphi }+{\\\\phi }_{\\\\theta }+{\\\\phi }_{{ad},{gp}}+{\\\\phi }_{{ad},{wp}}$$\\n                    (2.1)\\n                where the first three terms are harmonic potentials given by$${\\\\phi }_{T}=\\\\frac{1}{2}{K}_{T}(r-{{r}_{0}}){\\\\,\\\\!}^{2},\\\\, {\\\\phi }_{\\\\varphi }=\\\\frac{1}{2}{K}_{\\\\varphi }{(\\\\varphi -{\\\\varphi }_{0})}^{2},\\\\, {\\\\phi }_{\\\\theta }=\\\\frac{1}{2}{K}_{\\\\theta }{(\\\\theta -{\\\\theta }_{0})}^{2}$$\\n                    (2.2)\\n                where \\\\({K}_{T}\\\\,=\\\\,1000\\\\), \\\\({K}_{\\\\varphi }\\\\,=\\\\,0.1\\\\) and \\\\({K}_{\\\\theta }\\\\,=\\\\,0.1\\\\). The equilibrium distance and angles are \\\\({r}_{0}\\\\,=\\\\,1\\\\), \\\\({\\\\varphi }_{0}={180}^{\\\\circ }\\\\) and \\\\({\\\\theta }_{0}={90}^{\\\\circ }\\\\). Note that here the Lennard-Jones unit system are applied. Lennard-Jones potential is used to describe the adhesion interaction between graphene particles,$${\\\\phi }_{{ad},{gp}}={4\\\\varepsilon }_{{ad},{gp}}\\\\left[{\\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{gp}}}{r}\\\\right)}^{12}-{\\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{gp}}}{r}\\\\right)}^{6}\\\\right]$$\\n                    (2.3)\\n                Where \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{{ad},{gp}}=1\\\\), and \\\\({\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{gp}}{{\\\\mbox{=}}}\\\\,0.89\\\\). The adhesion interaction between graphene particles and water particles,$${\\\\phi }_{{ad},{wp}}={4\\\\varepsilon }_{{ad},{wp}}\\\\left[{\\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{wp}}}{r}\\\\right)}^{12}-{\\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{wp}}}{r}\\\\right)}^{6}\\\\right]$$\\n                    (2.4)\\n                where \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{{ad},{wp}}=3\\\\), and \\\\({\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{wp}}{{\\\\mbox{=}}}0.89\\\\). Besides, LJ potential is also used to depict the interaction between water particles$${\\\\phi }_{{ad},{wp}}={4\\\\varepsilon }_{{wp}}\\\\left[{\\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\sigma }_{{wp}}}{r}\\\\right)}^{12}-{\\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\sigma }_{{wp}}}{r}\\\\right)}^{6}\\\\right]$$\\n                    (2.5)\\n                where \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{{wp}}=1\\\\), and \\\\({\\\\sigma }_{{wp}}=0.955\\\\). The periodic boundary condition is adopted. To simulate the shrink process, the simulation box size is gradually reduced with water particles decreasing accordingly.In some calculation models, parameters are changed due to the simulation scenario and scale difference. To be specific, the calculation model in Supplementary Fig.\\u00a024 does not include water particles, and the parameters \\\\({K}_{T}=100\\\\), \\\\({K}_{\\\\varphi }=\\\\,10\\\\), \\\\({\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{gp}}\\\\,{{\\\\mbox{=}}}0.4\\\\); in the calculation model (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a05), \\\\({K}_{T}=\\\\,100\\\\), \\\\({K}_{\\\\varphi }=100\\\\), and \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{{ad},{wp}}{{\\\\mbox{=}}}\\\\,0.2\\\\) to keep graphene sheets stay together32,33,34.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the\\u00a0Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\\n\\n\\nData availability\\nThe data generated in this study are provided in the Supplementary Information and Source Data file.\\u00a0Source data are provided with this paper.\\nCode availability\\nThe code supporting this study is available from the corresponding author upon request.\\nReferencesSchaedler, T.

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us?IF YOU'RE an advanced runner, you're probably no stranger to pushing limits. But have you considered taking your training to the next level? If so, it might be time to add a curved treadmill to your training repertoire. Imagine a cardio machine that challenges your physical limits and can also reduce your risk of injury. That's right\\u2014a curved treadmill offers a more natural gait that can result in shorter stride length.  According to research, a decreased stride length results in less impact, meaning your joints will take less of a beating. They're non-motorized and can be placed anywhere without requiring a power outlet, making curved treadmills an easy addition to virtually any home gym setup. You can walk, jog, or run on curved treadmills, just like you can on any standard machine. But because there's no motor, the user's movement powers the treadmill, resulting in up to 30% more calories burned compared to a motorized treadmill.Best Commercial Grade Curved TreadmillHammer Strength HD TreadRead moreBest Value Curved TreadmillAssault Fitness AssaultRunner ProRead moreBest Curved Treadmill for SprintingTrueForm Runner Curved TreadmillRead moreThese machines offer a dynamic, advanced way to do sprint and interval training indoors. \\\"The curved tread is ideal for anyone who wants to learn to build speed and acceleration without hitting the track,\\\" says our Fitness Director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S. \\\"You\\u2019ll also get much better hamstring engagement on a curved tread than on a standard tread.\\\"So if you're ready to take on a new challenge, it's time to give a curved treadmill a try. With a little practice, you\\u2019ll be running like a pro in no time.

It was originally built for commercial gyms, so you can trust it's made to last. The treadmill has an adjustable resistance level which allows you to customize the intensity of the workout, making it ideal for experienced athletes in need of an extra challenge. It also comes with a built-in, easy to use console that displays key workout metrics such as speed, distance, and calories burned.

We find the TrueForm to better simulate road running, but many actually prefer the Assault Air Runner. Having been used in the CrossFit Games multiple times, the Assault Air Runner is non-motorized with a thick rubber belt that feels very comfortable in comparison to the ones often seen on traditional treadmills.All in all, the Air Runner is one of the best values in the category currently available.What do buyers say? \\\"If you are seriously considering, stop waiting, and just buy it. I have had ... a couple of other treadmills, motorized of course, with screens and connected this or that, but nothing compares to this machine,\\\" said one Amazon reviewer.Read more: Most Cushioned Running ShoesDimensions (D x W x H)70 x 33 x 64 inchesItem weight280 lb.Weight capacity350 lb.Display7-inch Hi-Contrast, UV Resistant Console ScreenMax. speed20 MPHBest Curved Treadmill for SprintingTrueForm Runner Curved Treadmill$6,899 at trueformrunner.comProsNon-motorizedNo max. speed limitHefty weight capacityNearest simulation of genuine road runningCompact footprintConsExpensiveIncline/decline not adjustableThe TrueForm Runner is non-motorized, meaning the only thing powering it is you, and trust us, you\\u2019ll feel it. It features over 200 ABEC Bearings that the rubber track runs on to create a smooth, yet responsive feeling that is superior to standard treadmills. Although the TrueForm Runner is built to take a beating, it\\u2019s unique shape is actually incredibly well thought out. Rather than being flat, the curved design is there to help improve your running form by forcing you to go from heel striking to a mid-foot strike (which is a much better way to run.)And because it\\u2019s powered by you, you\\u2019ll get better hamstring and glute engagement\\u2014and you\\u2019ll be able to reach speeds that many conventional treadmills can\\u2019t, if you\\u2019re so inclined. If you want to sprint or interval-train with true intensity on a treadmill, this is the way to go, even if there is a bit of a learning, err, curve to this one.Read more: Best Workout HeadphonesDimensions (D x W x H)60 x 36 x 57 inchesItem weight325 lb.Weight capacity450 lb.Display7-inch digital screenMax. speedInfiniteAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowMost Affordable Curved TreadmillSB Fitness Equipment CT400 Self Generated Curved Commercial Treadmill$1,895 at Amazon$1,795 at sbfitnessequipment.com$2,378 at WalmartProsGreat priceHas adjustable resistanceSpeed changes adjust quicklyLighter than other optionsConsMay not be able to outlast higher end modelsIf you're looking to level up your training with a curved treadmill at home but don't want to break the bank, this one from SB Fitness Equipment is worth considering.

Rather than just being made for running, the SKILLMILL utilizes \\u201cMultidrive Technology\\u201d that creates resistance on the free-spinning tread belt to turn the treadmill into a simulated sled push. Several companies have tried to duplicate this, but TechnoGym is absolutely producing the best version\\u2014it only takes a few minutes on the SKILLMILL to realize it\\u2019s unlike any other treadmill you\\u2019ve ever used.You can go from walking to running to feeling like you\\u2019re pushing hundreds of pounds on a track.

So the answer is maybe. Curved treadmills are non-motorized. They rely instead on you walking or running, and the belt being pushed backward manually with every foot strike on the sloped surface. While this might not seem as \\u201cfancy\\u201d or high-tech as a powered treadmill, this design has its benefits.\\\"Curved treadmills tend to recruit more muscles due to the shape of the belt and the act of propelling against it,\\\" says Eric Sung, C.S.C.S., a strength and conditioning coach based in Queens, NY. \\\"It also eases the strain of your joints because of the curvature and is often better for users with varied joint pain.\\\"By some reports, exercising on a curved treadmill burns 30% more calories over a traditional powered treadmill.\\\"One drawback of a curved treadmill is that it is difficult to achieve higher speeds (sprints) with proper technique. This can impact front side mechanics with one's stride through by 'reaching',\\\" explains Sung. Another thing to consider: because curved treads are motorless, they also don't allow for incline or decline capabilities.Read more: Curved TreadmillsTraining on a Curved TreadmillCurved treadmills are ideal for time-based workouts, where you know exactly how long you\\u2019ll be working for and can concentrate on putting in the effort.Before you dive headfirst into training on a curved treadmill, it\\u2019s important to take things slow. Which starts with finding your feet. Measure out your early efforts before attempting harder workouts, as running on a curved belt requires different mechanics than a traditional treadmill. Toggle between accelerating and holding a steady pace to get a feel for both.One of the key things to remember when training on a curved treadmill is that you\\u2019re in control. Although it may feel challenging at first, your brain will soon figure out the motion and then your body will fall into motion. You\\u2019ll need to position yourself closer to the front of the treadmill than might seem natural, allowing your foot to pull the belt back on landing. Maintain good posture, stay tall with your core engaged, and drive your arms to maintain momentum.How to Select the Best Curved Treadmill (for You)When shopping for a curved treadmill, there are several factors to consider. These include:Size and space: Make sure you have enough space to accommodate a curved treadmill. Consider the dimensions of the machine and ensure that it fits comfortably in your workout space.Price: Curved treadmills can be expensive, so determine your budget before starting your search. Keep in mind that while cheaper options are available, they may not offer the same quality and durability as higher-end models.Weight capacity: Make sure the treadmill you choose can accommodate your weight and the weight of anyone else who will be using it.Durability: Look for a machine with a sturdy construction and durable materials, as well as a good warranty, to ensure it will last.Console and metrics: Consider the built-in console and what metrics it displays, such as speed, distance, calories burned, and heart rate. Look for a console that is easy to use and customizable to your fitness goals.Brand reputation: Do some research on the brand of the curved treadmill you are interested in, and read reviews from other users to ensure that you are making a wise investment in a quality machine.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowHow We SelectedWe consulted with Men's Health's fitness experts, editors and Director, Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., on the best curved treadmills on the market now.

If you want to see your music productions come together properly, to get a great overview of your mixes, and to tweak your tracks to the minutest of detail, a dedicated monitor is the way to go. You will never see your music in the same way ever again!Let\\u2019s be honest, one of the items in today's music production studio that deserves more attention is the humble computer monitor. With so many of us using PC and Mac DAWs to make music, the computer screen has become the key to seeing our music come together. It seems crazy, then, to use a tiny laptop screen or low-quality monitor to see these productions take shape. \\u00a0Thanks largely to the gaming world, the computer screen has come on in leaps and bounds in recent years, and these top quality 4k, curved or ultrawide screens make ideal visual companions to your DAW workflow.\\u00a0We've gathered the best of the current crop together for this guide, and present them to you here under specific categories so you can choose the perfect monitor depending on your studio space and workflow.\\u00a0Our top picks\\nBest overall\\n\\n\\n1.

BenQ PD2725U    Great all-rounder with enough features to justify the priceOur expert review:    SpecificationsSize: 27\\u201dResolution: 3,840 x 2,160Aspect ratio: 16:9Connectivity: Thunderbolt 3, HDMI, DisplayPort, USB-CToday's Best DealsCheck ThomannReasons to buy+Great colour accuracy+Good connectivity options+Sleek designReasons to avoid-Other 4K monitors are cheaper-Poor speakersThe BenQ PD2725U has a slim, sleek design and solid build, with a professional and modern appearance that will complement nearly any workspace. The 4K resolution and IPS panel provide clear, crisp images with excellent colour accuracy. The monitor has a wide colour palette and a relatively fast response time of 4ms to minimise ghosting, inaccuracies, and other artefacts.\\u00a0The PD2725U's biggest plus point is connectivity. As well as Thunderbolt and USB-C, you get DisplayPort and HDMI inputs, making it easy to connect to various devices. The inclusion of Thunderbolt 3 allows for fast data transfer and PD charging, and is a good option for use with laptops.Overall, the BenQ PD2725U is our top-performing monitor as it is well-suited to all sorts of creative professionals, not just DAW users. With excellent colour accuracy, a range of connectivity options, and a sleek design, it is a very a solid choice, and it easily has enough features to justify the extra outlay.Best budget(Image credit: HP)2.

The HP 27f does a superb job at providing everything a studio user would need, including a flat, bright 27\\u201d screen, a couple of HDMI inputs and a solid \\u2013 if a little conservative \\u2013 design.\\u00a0The 27f isn\\u2019t likely to set too many hearts racing, but it does provide a sensible option for anybody who wants to buy a monitor and doesn\\u2019t fancy obsessing over tiny details.Best curved 4k(Image credit: Dell)3. Dell S3221QSA    Fabulous curved monitor with unique features and a good price tagOur expert review:    Average Amazon review:\\u2606\\u2606\\u2606\\u2606\\u2606SpecificationsSize: 31.5\\u201dResolution: 3,840 x 2,160Aspect ratio: 16:9Connectivity: 1 x HDMI, 2 x DP, 1 x USB-C, 2 x USBToday's Best DealsCheck ThomannReasons to buy+Lovely design+Flexible multitasking features+Good priceReasons to avoid-Not true HDR-No USB-CThe Dell 4K S3221QS curved monitor not only looks good, but it matches its aesthetic with a great quality high-resolution panel and flexible multitasking features.\\u00a0While the lack of a USB-C port is a let down, the addition of decent speakers is a nice touch. Are they anywhere near audiophile quality or good enough to mix with? Of course not, but these speakers, tuned by Waves MaxxAudio, sound better than most other monitor speakers.\\u00a0As for the display, the 31.5\\u201d VA panel looks fantastic with as crisp and detailed an image as you would expect at that 4k resolution, and an accurate colour match to boot. Because of the curvature, even after hours of use, there\\u2019s no eye strain.\\u00a0The Dell 4K S3221QS\\u2019s multitasking features are also a plus point, including Picture-in-Picture and Picture-by-Picture to view visual information from two different sources. You also get EasyArrange mode to organise all your tabs and apps.The Dell 4K S3221QS is an excellent monitor that, despite some drawbacks, offers a lot of monitor for the price.Best pro monitor(Image credit: BenQ)4.

There's great connectivity, and you also get useful Picture-In-Picture and Picture-By-Picture modes.\\u00a0The only real factor that slightly lets the BenQ PD2705UA down is its price, but other than that this is a fantastic monitor, especially if your space is tight.Best ergonomic monitor(Image credit: LG)5. LG 32UN880    Versatile monitor that can be adjusted to work well in most studiosOur expert review:    SpecificationsSize: 32\\u201dResolution: 3,840 x 2,160Aspect ratio: 16:9Connectivity: 2 x HDMI, 1 x DP, 1 x USB-C, 2 x USBToday's Best DealsCheck ThomannReasons to buy+Adjusts in any direction+Amazing picture quality+Great connectivityReasons to avoid-Not bright enough for true HDR-Won't suit more compact spacesThis 32-inch monitor has incredible colour accuracy and a beautiful picture quality, and doesn't cost the earth, but as good as these qualities are, there is one that stands out even more: its ease of use.The LG 32UN880 avoids the usual bog standard mount and stand that all monitors seem to have, and uses a C-Clamp, One Click Mount instead. This allows it to extend, retract, move high or low, tilt and pivot like no other screen out there. This alone almost justifies the already very approachable price tag.\\u00a0Add in great connectivity and the LG 32UN880 UltraFine Display Ergo is a great option that will fit in most studios because of that stand, although if you have a more compact space, you might want to look at some of the smaller options here.\\u00a0Best compact curved(Image credit: MSI)6.

A lot of the advancements we see in computer technology are the result of PC gamers constantly demanding more, better and bigger boosts from their gear.\\u00a0The MSI Optix AG32C is a great example, packing in a huge 32\\u201d full HD screen which gives music producers a heck of a lot of space to work with.\\u00a0It\\u2019s another one with a curved screen, which makes sense when the panel is the size it is, while the 16:9 aspect ratio means session timelines will have plenty of room to breathe.Best compact(Image credit: ASUS)7. ASUS ProArt PA248QV    Smaller screen with vibrant colour reproductionOur expert review:    SpecificationsSize: 24.1\\u201dResolution: 1920x1200Aspect ratio: 16:10Connectivity: 1 x HDMI, 1 x DisplayPort, 1 x VGAToday's Best DealsCheck ThomannReasons to buy+Ideal as a second monitor+Plenty of adjustment optionsReasons to avoid-Not the most attractive design\\u2026While primarily marketed as a monitor for graphic designers, on account of it featuring pro-level colour calibration, the ASUS ProArt series actually represent decent value for other creative pursuits. If, for example, video forms part of your workflow then the ProArt monitors are a great option.We could see the ASUS ProArt PA248QV making an ideal second monitor, to supplement an existing setup. It\\u2019s fully adjustable in terms of its layout, so it could be placed vertically next to a main monitor and quite happily host your plugin interfaces, leaving a larger screen to handle DAW sessions.Best large monitor(Image credit: Samsung)8. Samsung CRG9    The best top-tier monitor for screen spaceOur expert review:    SpecificationsSize: 49\\u201dResolution: 5120x1440Aspect ratio: 16:9Connectivity: 2 x DisplayPort, 1 x HDMIToday's Best DealsCheck ThomannReasons to buy+Enormous!\\u00a0+QLED screen really popsReasons to avoid-Price tag to match the screen size-No USB-CIn the Samsung CRG9, there exists possibly the most crazy-looking monitor on the market today. While it\\u2019s nominally listed at 49\\u201d, it\\u2019s possibly better to picture two curved 27\\u201d monitors next to each other.\\u00a0The QLED screen ensures the sharpest images \\u2013 perfect for reading those tiny parameters in your DAW \\u2013 while there is a whole host of connectivity onboard, albeit no USB-C.\\u00a0It\\u2019s expensive, sure, but for the right studio the CRG9 would provide a commanding centrepiece.\\u00a0FAQsWhat size monitor do I need?MusicRadar's got your back \\n\\n\\nOur team of expert musicians and producers spends hours testing products to help you choose the best music-making gear for you. Find out more about how we test.When you\\u2019re shopping for a new monitor, there are likely two main factors that will come into your decision-making process; size and cost. For music-making, it\\u2019s not as important to have high-resolution images, or snappy refresh rates. Leave that to the gamers. For home studios, you\\u2019re looking for as much screen real estate as you can afford.\\u00a0That\\u2019s not to say you necessarily need to look towards the enormous TV-sized monitors; indeed, if it\\u2019s located on your desk mere inches from your eyes, we\\u2019d probably advise against anything larger than 32\\u201d. What you\\u2019re looking for is that balance. Large enough so you can fit everything on and it be at a decent enough size that you can read it, but not so large that your eyes start to ache after an hour\\u2019s use.\\u00a0Do I need a curved monitor?The jury is out on curved monitors. For some, a gentle curvature of the screen means less time turning your head. For others, they are more of a fad. Your mileage may vary, as the saying goes.What about Ultrawide monitors?What is interesting, particularly for DAW users, is the new breed of monitors which have grown in popularity in recent years. Ultrawide monitors, which offer a 21:9 ratio, are near-perfect for use with DAWs. The extra width offers the ability to fit more of your timeline in view, while also enabling you to place multiple applications next to each other and see them all at the same time.\\u00a0You could, for example, have your DAW fill three-quarters of the screen, and use the remaining quarter to display your plugins. Admittedly, this isn\\u2019t unique to ultrawide monitors, but that extra width makes it a lot more palatable than a regular screen.What else do I need to consider?If the monitors are being used in a home studio, then you can look past the built-in speakers as they will most likely be bypassed. Connectivity is important, however, and is dependent on your laptop or PC\\u2019s video output capabilities. HDMI is the most common, however desktop PCs may also offer DisplayPort outputs. Newer laptops \\u2013 particularly Apple models \\u2013 will also offer Thunderbolt as an output source for your monitor.How we choose productsHere at\\u00a0MusicRadar, we are experts in our field, with many years of playing, creating and product testing between us.

Hook your expensive Apple laptop into a quality display, and not only will you increase your screen real estate, many of the monitors below provide incredibly vibrant and color accurate pictures.\\u00a0We use a Klein K 10-A colorimeter and a battery of software tests, putting every MacBook Pro monitor through its paces when we review one. You can be sure we\\u2019d never recommend a subpar display to pair with your high-end laptop, even if it was a cheap panel.\\u00a0Save big with the very best Prime Day Deals nowMy current favorite pick as the best monitor for MacBook Pro I find most easy to recommend to most people is the remarkable Apple Studio display. This astounding 5K screen looks incredibly vivid, and its six-speaker sound system means the Studio serves up compelling audio. If you\\u2019re looking for something a lot more affordable, the Asus TUF VG28UQLIA is the best cheap MacBook Pro monitor, partly because it produces such pleasingly accurate colors.\\u00a0The list of the best MacBook Pro monitors I\\u2019ve curated below covers a number of budgets, so if money is an issue right now, you should still be able to buy a model that won\\u2019t do too much damage to your finances.

But it also has unique features that any Mac user can enjoy, like a killer (for a monitor) six-speaker sound system and a 12MP ultrawide camera that supports Apple's Center Stage feature, courtesy of an onboard A13 Bionic chip. \\u00a0With its ultrawide camera, fantastic speaker setup and gorgeous 27-inch 5K screen, this is easily one of the\\u00a0best monitors for MacBook Pro\\u00a0owners seeking an external display.\\u00a0Read our full Apple Studio Display review.The best budget MacBook Pro monitor(Image credit: Tom's Guide)2.

Yet in our book, a top-tier 4K monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate and two HDMI 2.1 ports is damn good value for money.Apart from its reasonable price, the VG28UQL1A is simply a gorgeous unit, with some of the richest and most accurate colors of any gaming display we've tested. The screen's HDR capabilities are almost unmatched, especially the way it handles reds, oranges and pinks. This panel even boasts good speakers, which not many gaming monitors can claim.Read our full Asus TUF VG28UQL1A review.The best 4K MacBook Pro monitor(Image credit: Dell)3. Dell UltraSharp U2720QBest 4K monitor for MacBook Pro overallSpecificationsDimensions: 24.1 x 7.3 x 20.7 inches (with stand)Screen Size: 27 inchesResolution: 3840 x 2160Refresh Rate: 60 HzInputs: DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-CToday's Best DealsView at NeweggView at Amazon(Black)View at Amazon(LED)Reasons to buy+Good color accuracy+Doubles as a USB hub+Thin bezelsReasons to avoid-Underwhelming brightness-Meager 60Hz refresh rateThe Dell UltraSharp U2720Q is a workhorse of a 4K monitor that does everything pretty well, making it our overall pick for the best MacBook Pro monitor. This 27-inch display offers great color reproduction, and its 3840 x 2160 resolution lets you work and play on your MacBook at 4K.\\u00a0We also appreciate this monitor's thin-bezelled InfinityEdge display design, as thin bezels tend to help whatever you're looking at pop off the screen. This UltraSharp offers plenty of ports, too, and it has both USB-A and USB-C downstream ports, meaning you can plug USB accessories directly into the monitor and (as long as your laptop is connected via USB) use it as an impromptu USB hub for your MacBook.With an MSRP of just over $500 it's reasonably priced, too \\u2014 the only big downside is that the UltraSharp is neither as bright (advertised as maxing out at 350 nits) nor as fast (60Hz refresh rate) as the Liquid Retina XDR display built into the 2021 MacBook Pros. But if you just need a spacious 4K display to expand your MacBook's screen real estate and get more done, Dell's 27-inch UltraSharp is a great pick.THe best gaming MacBook Pro monitor(Image credit: Razer)4. Razer Raptor 27    The best overall gaming monitor for MacBook ProOur expert review:    SpecificationsDimensions: 24.2 x 15.3 x 7.5 inchesScreen Size: 27 inchesResolution: 2560 x 1440Refresh Rate: 144 HzInputs: DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-CToday's Best DealsView at Amazon(HDR)Reasons to buy+Gorgeous display+Smart design+Straightforward menusReasons to avoid-Very expensive compared to others on this list-Requires USB-C for customizationThe Razer Raptor 27 is currently our pick for the best MacBook Pro gaming monitor. This 27-inch screen displays gorgeous colors with stunning accuracy, at crisp quad HD resolutions. You can run games at more than 120 frames per second and see every frame, thanks to the Raptor 27\\u2019s fast refresh rate.The model we reviewed has a 144Hz refresh rate, but you can get an even faster 164HZ model for about $100 more. And though the 2560 x 1440 resolution delivers fewer pixels per inch than your MacBook Pro's Liquid Retina XDR display, it still displays more than enough detail to make games look great and run well. In other words, it\\u2019s a nearly perfect midpoint of performance and accessibility.The only real downside to the Raptor 27 is that it\\u2019s expensive, especially compared to other gaming monitors with similar specs. But you\\u2019re also paying for the monitor\\u2019s excellent physical design, which makes the ports extremely easy to access, and the cables very simple to manage.Read our full Razer Raptor 27 review.The best portable MacBook Pro monitor(Image credit: Tom's Guide)5.

A 14-inch, 1080p portable monitor that offers 10-point touch, it\\u2019s a good-looking, well-performing, and easy-to-transport addition to your tech arsenal that lives up to Lenovo\\u2019s long-standing reputation for function-forward and frill-free design.But with an asking price of $500, you have to really want a great portable monitor with touch controls to invest in the M14t. Otherwise, a few of the other monitors on this list are cheaper, with higher resolutions and better refresh rates. But if you really need an excellent portable monitor for your MacBook, the Lenovo ThinkVision M14t is our top overall pick. If you want one without touch functionality, Lenovo sells a cheaper non-touch version for $249.Read our full Lenovo ThinkVision M14t review.The best professional MacBook Pro monitor(Image credit: Future)6. Apple Pro Display XDRThe best monitor for pro photo/video work on a MacBook ProAverage Amazon review:\\u2606\\u2606\\u2606\\u2606\\u2606SpecificationsDimensions: 28.3 x 16.2 x 9.3 inches (with stand) Screen Size: 32 inchesRefresh Rate: 60 HzResolution: 6016 x 3384 pixelsInputs: Thunderbolt 3/USB-CToday's Best DealsView at Amazon(8TB)View at Amazon(32-inch)View at Best Buy(Silver)Reasons to buy+Gorgeous display+Remarkably high resolution/brightness+Reference modes ideal for editors+Intuitive and easy to useReasons to avoid-Extremely high starting price makes this unreasonable for all but professionals and rich peopleIf you can afford it, Apple's Pro Display XDR is a top-tier monitor for MacBook Pro users looking to get some professional editing done.\\u00a0This 32-inch screen delivers remarkably accurate colors at brightness levels of up to 1,000 nits, or 1,600 with some HDR content. It's gorgeous to look at and easy to configure, and though it's not OLED the Pro Display XDR delivers sumptuous contrast that ensures blacks look infinitely inky next to blazing whites.\\u00a0You can even get a model with nano-textured glass that supposedly reduces glare without affecting contrast, but it will cost you an extra $1,000 on top of the already outrageous $4,999 starting price. It also doesn't come with a stand by default; you'll need to shell out another $999 to get one, though Apple's Pro Stand is at least a remarkably well-engineered stand.Of course, Apple can get away with charging these high prices because the equipment is high-quality and aimed at photo/video professionals working for big organizations. If you need the best monitor for photo/video editing on your MacBook Pro and don't mind paying an arm and a leg, the Pro Display XDR will serve you well.\\u00a0Read our full report on what it's like to use Apple's Pro Display XDR.How to choose the best MacBook Pro monitor for youHow to choose the best monitor for your MacBookFinding the best monitor for your MacBook can be a confusing experience, especially if you're unsure what you need. There are a few key details to pay attention to for any monitor, and some specific advice for certain specialized uses.Size: A larger monitor is generally better simply because it offers the most visual real estate, which is better for both full-screen media consumption and split-screen multitasking. Higher resolution is also better, since it allows you to see more detail and fit more information on the screen. The old phrase \\\"bigger is better\\\" applies to both here, and we recommend opting for larger screens and higher resolution whenever possible. However, keep in mind that you'll probably need to scale up the size of text (and macOS in general) on 4K monitors, as that resolution makes text hard to read on all but the largest monitors.Shape: Most monitors are simple rectangles you stand up on a desk, but nowadays you also have the option of buying monitors that are curved, or even portable. A simple flat monitor will serve most uses quite well, but you might want to try a curved monitor if you want a more immersive experience (especially when gaming) since the curve keeps all areas of the monitor within easy viewing distance. Likewise, you might like to invest in a portable monitor instead of a traditional one if you want an external display that's easy to use with your MacBook Pro on the go.\\u00a0Response time: If you care about playing the latest games under optimal conditions, you'll want to look for a monitor with low response time. This measures how long it takes for the display to respond to what you're doing, and it's typically expressed as a measurement (in milliseconds) of how long it takes a pixel on the display to go from one color to another and back again.\\u00a0Unless you're planning to play games on your MacBook that demand quick reflexes or pinpoint accuracy, you really don't need to worry about response time. In general, anything under 10ms is good, though 5ms or less is better for gaming. Many gaming monitors promise response times as low as 1ms, which is about as good as you can hope for.Refresh rate: Refresh rate measures how many times per second your monitor can draw a new image. It's measured in Hertz, and again if you're not planning on doing a lot of intense gaming you probably don't need to worry about this very much. Most monitor achieve refresh rates of 60Hz or less, and that's plenty for watching videos or getting work done. However, the new MacBook Pros have Liquid Retina XDR displays that can achieve variable refresh rates of up to 120Hz, so you'll need a monitor with at least a 120Hz refresh rate if you want it to be as good as your MacBook's display.If you want to play games at higher than 120 frames per second, or you're planning on working with video at framerates higher than 120 fps, you'll want a monitor with even higher refresh rates. 120Hz is as high as most monitors go, but some gaming monitors can achieve refresh rates of 360Hz or higher.\\u00a0How we tested these monitorsHow we test the best monitors for MacBook ProsWhen seeking out the best monitors, we test every display we review with our Klein K 10-A colorimeter, paired with testing software. We use this high-quality scope to measure the display's brightness levels, color gamut and color accuracy.Brightness is measured in nits, or candela per square metre (cd/m2). More nits means a higher brightness, which translates into clearer picture, brighter color and usually a more realistic looking image. For basic monitors, we expect a display backlight to produce between 2-300 nits of brightness, though HDR (high dynamic range) displays will often exceed that with a higher maximum brightness. However, brightness alone doesn't make for a great display, since some monitors will wash out colors or offer inconsistent backlight that varies in some portions of the display panel.HDR also presents its own testing challenges, as new capabilities and standards allow a monitor to offer higher peak luminance than our standard tests will register. When in doubt, read an individual review for a discussion of these issues, and how an individual product will handle each.Color is the other big concern for displays. Monitors that produce more colors have a larger color gamut, as measured under the sRGB or P3 color standards. This is presented as a percentage, with higher percentages indicating more colors.Color accuracy is the other aspect of color, which lets us measure how closely a monitor can reproduce a given shade. This is presented as a Delta-E rating, which indicates the level of deviation from perfect. Zero is a perfect score, while higher numbers indicate lower accuracy.We also test a display's response time, using a Leo Bodnar input lag tester. This device measures how long it takes a signal to travel from a source device to the monitor and show up on the display. Measured in milliseconds, this number is most useful for Mac gamers and anyone that needs immediate onscreen feedback from any input.Finally, every monitor we test is also used for web browsing, streaming video and gaming, as well as the writing of the review itself. Our anecdotal testing will often allow us to note the quirks of a display that lab testing might miss, whether it's difficulty in scaling content or issues with backlight or color reproduction.Round up of today's best dealsApple Studio Display $1,599.99 $1,499.99ViewSee all pricesAsus TUF Gaming VG28UQL1A $649 $580.62ViewSee all pricesDell U2720Q $719.99ViewSee all pricesRazer Raptor 27 $897ViewSee all pricesLenovo ThinkVision M14t $484ViewSee all pricesApple Pro Display XDR $5,999.99ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \\n\\nGet the top Amazon Prime Day deals right in your inbox: Sign up now!Receive the hottest deals and product recommendations alongside the biggest tech news from the Tom's Guide team straight to your inbox!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\\nDave MeiklehamSocial Links NavigationUK Computing EditorDave is a computing editor at Tom\\u2019s Guide and covers everything from cutting edge laptops to ultrawide monitors.

Some use OLED (organic LED) panels to give you the deepest blacks and striking contrast, others have incredibly fast response times that make both work and play a smooth, seamless experience. \\n\\nGranted, curved monitors can be more expensive than their flatter counterparts. But according to Shahbaz Khan, a systems administrator for a Canadian software company, with over 10 years of experience in the information technology (IT) industry, they are an investment that can pay off if you spend a majority of your time at your monitor. \\n\\nHe said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s about the experience, at the end of the day. You feel completely immersed in whatever you\\u2019re playing, watching or working on, and it feels easier on the eyes. It\\u2019s more engaging, especially for gamers and people who frequently work with graphics and content creation. It\\u2019s a more convenient way to work and play.\\u201d \\n\\nScroll below to read his advice on how curved monitors differ from flat displays, and what kind of monitor would work best for you (because not all curved monitors are the same). Buy yours with Amazon Prime, and get it as early as tomorrow. \\n\\n1. Best Overall: Alienware AW3423DWF QD-OLED\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPros \\n\\n\\n\\nCrisp, vibrant visuals  \\nFast refresh rate and low latency\\nExcellent connectivity options\\n\\n \\n\\nCons \\n\\n\\n\\nHeavy and bulky\\n\\n \\n\\nIf you\\u2019re looking for a high-quality monitor that checks all of the boxes, in terms of size, resolution, connectivity and design, Alienware\\u2019s QD-OLED curved monitor is the one to get. Its sleek 1800R curved display wraps around your field of view, and features Legend 2 AlienFX lighting on its rear, for added flair. The Quantum Dot OLED display, with a 165Hz refresh rate and 21:9 aspect ratio is impressive; it also offers six pre-set picture modes that are optimised for different gaming genres. AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and 0.1ms response time offer superb gaming performance, no matter how demanding the title you\\u2019re playing. However, do note the monitor is large and quite heavy at 9.3kg, with V-shaped legs that take up considerable space on a desk. Still, it offers excellent adjustability: the 35-inch screen can be raised or lowered by 4.3 inches, tilted backward by -5 degrees, or forward up to 21 degrees. A rare addition is its swivel feature \\u2013 it can swivel by 20 degrees, both left and right \\u2013 something most curved displays cannot manage. Reviewers love the include of an HDMI 2.1 port in this monitor, which was lacking in its predecessor. It also includes a pair of DisplayPorts, four USB-A ports, a headphone jack and a line-out port. \\n\\nBonus: Buy with 0% installments and pay Dh326.67 for 12 months with select banks. \\n\\nWarranty: Amazon offers one-year extended warranty by Salama Care for Dh227, and two-year extended warranty for Dh375. \\n\\n2. Best for Gaming: Asus TUF Gaming Monitor\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPros \\n\\n\\n\\nBright hi-res screen  \\nFast refresh rate \\nFreeSync Premium technology\\nGood connectivity options \\n\\n \\n\\nCons \\n\\n\\n\\nNo local dimming\\n\\n \\n\\nA device that has all the essentials for smooth, stutter-free gaming, Asus TUF is a 34-inch WQHD (wide quad high definition) monitor that curves at 1500R for immersive gameplay. Gaming feels incredibly responsive here, according to reviewers, thanks to a 165Hz refresh rate that purges lag and motion blur, and FreeSync Premium technology that eliminates screen tearing and choppy frame rates. The monitor\\u2019s bright HDR visuals peak at 400 nits, so it can combat glare in well-lit environments. Although it\\u2019s primarily a gaming monitor, you can use it for productivity tasks as well \\u2013 there\\u2019s plenty of screen space for multitasking. There\\u2019s also extensive connectivity, with two DisplayPorts 1.4, two HDMI 2.0 ports, and two USB Hub ports. On the downside, while it has an excellent contrast ratio that leads to deep blacks, it doesn\\u2019t include a local dimming feature for richly detailed visuals. \\n\\nBonus: Buy with 0% installments and pay Dh152.92 for 12 months with select banks. \\n\\nWarranty: Amazon offers one-year extended warranty by Salama Care for Dh108, and two-year extended warranty for Dh179. \\n\\n3. Best Ultrawide: Samsung Odyssey Neo G9\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPros \\n\\n\\n\\nLarge and bright hi-res screen  \\nExcellent reflection handling\\n240Hz refresh rate \\nIncludes height, tilt and swivel adjustments\\n\\n \\n\\nCons \\n\\n\\n\\nNarrow viewing angles\\n\\n \\n\\nSamsung makes some of the best curved monitors out there right now, according to Khan. The Odyssey Neo G9 is one with a massive wingspan, thanks to its 49-inch screen and 32:9 aspect ratio, which lets you lose yourself in gaming or content creation. The large, hi-res screen offers enough space for multitasking, gaming or media consumption, and reviewers say it\\u2019s bright enough to combat glare in well-lit spaces. Two HDMI 2.1 inputs, along with 240Hz refresh rate with FreeSync support and G-SYNC compatibility, all make it an excellent canvas for HDR (high dynamic range) content. Thanks to its QLED panel and local dimming capabilities, the blacks here are rich and deep, and it offers a large colour gamut. Some reviewers do note that it\\u2019s not the best screen to share with someone else, since its aggressive screen curve means narrower viewing angles. \\n\\nBonus: Buy with 0% installments and pay Dh333.33 for 12 months with select banks. \\n\\nWarranty: Amazon offers one-year extended warranty by Salama Care for Dh227, and two-year extended warranty for Dh375. \\n\\n4. Best Value: Gigabyte G27FC\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPros \\n\\n\\n\\n1080p Full HD display   \\nSturdy, adjustable design\\nExcellent gaming performance\\n\\n \\n\\nCons \\n\\n\\n\\nNo HDMI 2.1 port\\n\\n \\n\\nLooking for a curved screen on a budget? Gigbayte\\u2019s G27FC is a good place to start. This 27-inch gaming monitor offers 1080p Full HD resolution and 165Hz refresh rate \\u2013 perfect for playing PC games at higher framerates. The screen curves at 1500R for an immersive feel, even though the curve is not immediately obvious when you\\u2019re sitting right in front of the monitor. Adaptive-Sync (FreeSync Premium) puts an end to choppy gameplay and broken frames, and a speedy 1ms response time fully eliminates image lag and tearing. The device has a no-frills design, and can be mounted on a wall, a monitor arm or via its included stand. There is a decent array of ports: a DisplayPort, two HDMI 1.4 inputs, two USB 3.0 ports for charging devices, a USB-B port and a headphone jack. Reviewers wish, however, that it came with a HDMI 2.1 port to support the advanced display functions of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. \\n\\nBonus: Buy with 0% installments and pay Dh133.49 for 12 months with select banks. \\n\\n5. Best Budget: LG 34GP63A Curved Ultragear QHD\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPros \\n\\n\\n\\nUltrawide screen  \\nHandles dark scenes well \\nIncludes several useful features\\nGood connectivity options\\nBuilt-in speakers \\n\\n \\n\\nCons \\n\\n\\n\\nAudio quality is mediocre\\n\\n \\n\\nLG\\u2019s 34GP63A Ultragear is an affordable ultrawide monitor that offers plenty of bang for its buck. Its 34-inch quantum HD curved panel has an aspect ratio of 21:9 and a 160Hz native refresh rate with 1ms motion blur reduction that reduces blurring and ghosting. HDR10 support and the ability to cover the entire sRGB colour space helps it achieve vivid, accurate colours without over-saturation. The backlight of the monitor is flicker-free, and you can also select a low blue light pre-set to reduce eye strain. Reviewers are surprised to find additional features at this price point \\u2013 from a Black Stabiliser that dynamically brightens dark scenes, to Dynamic Action Sync that helps reduce input lag. There are plenty of connectivity options, including two HDMI 2.0 ports, a DisplayPort 1.4, and a headphone jack. On the downside, several users complain that despite the built-in speakers, the audio is not as loud or dynamic as they would like. Overall, if you\\u2019re on a tight budget, this is a monitor you won\\u2019t regret buying. \\n\\nBonus: Buy with 0% installments and pay Dh104.92 for 12 months with select banks. \\n\\nWarranty: Amazon offers one-year extended warranty by Salama Care for Dh74, and two-year extended warranty for Dh122. \\n\\nHow do curved monitors differ from flat monitors? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Business professionals and those in creative fields will also find curved monitors useful for productivity tasks.\\n            Image Credit: Shutterstock\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most obvious difference, of course, is in their shape and design. \\n\\nCurved displays are considered to be more immersive, since they lend a feeling of dimensionality that you don\\u2019t usually find in a flat panel. You get a wider than usual field of view, with minimal distortion at the edges. \\n\\nAccording to Khan, because of their large screen real estate, graphic designers, photographers and other creative professionals would find that these monitors offer more natural viewing angles than a flat screen. Those who like to multitask would appreciate that they can open several documents and windows at a time, with minimal eyestrain. And gamers, of course, would enjoy the three-dimensional, immersive view that\\u2019s well-suited to gameplay with a lot of action, like racing games and flight simulators. \\n\\nHowever, it\\u2019s worth noting that not all curved displays are the same. Those used for general purposes offer a gentle curvature, while gaming and ultrawide productivity monitors have a more noticeable, pronounced curve. \\n\\nYou can actually measure the curve to understand what kind of monitor you\\u2019re looking at. Many have a 1800R curvature, which means if you lined up enough of these monitors side by side to form a circle, the radius would be 1,800mm or 1.8m. Monitors with sharper curves in this situation, would have a smaller radius, as low as 800R. \\n\\nWhat kind of curved monitor should I get? \\n\\nFor consumers\\u2019 purposes, it\\u2019s important to determine what you\\u2019re using the monitor for, in the first place. Based on your priorities, there are some factors worth considering, according to our expert: \\n\\nSize: In terms of screen size, Khan said: \\u201cThe bigger the better, but you should still maintain a safe viewing distance from the monitor so that it\\u2019s easy on the eyes.\\u201d From 24 inches to 49 inches, curved monitors come in a range of sizes. Most users would find a size of about 35 inches to be optimal for immersive gaming, watching videos, or tiling multiple windows. These monitors would also fit easily on most desks. \\n\\nResolution: Since curved monitors tend to use ultrawide panels, they usually have 21:9 or 32:9 aspect ratios (the latter is considered \\u2018super ultrawide\\u2019), instead of the usual 16:9 horizontal-to-vertical ratio of most monitors. The wider these panels, the more space you get for multitasking and e-sports. But note that if you\\u2019re watching a movie, it likely would not fit the entire screen. \\n\\nConnectivity: Most ports on curved monitors tend to face downward on the rear of the panel, so it\\u2019s a good idea to check all the ports to make sure you have what you need. Also, set up any cables during initial installation, since these monitors can be bulky and unwieldy to fiddle around with. \\n\\nErgonomics: Other key factors to consider are adjustments you can make to the monitor\\u2019s height and tilt function. \\n\\nOur recommendations are independently chosen by Gulf News editors.

Thirty years after the first Audi A4, the sharpened design language of the latest generation, now called the Audi A5, captivates with premium proportions. Both body styles, Sedan and Avant, perfectly embody the sporty essence of the Audi design philosophy. A new interior design language creates a feeling of space and sets the displays on a digital stage. The new operating concept increases interaction with the vehicle. Efficient partially electrified combustion engines and exciting S models round off the range.Since 2024, AUDI AG has restructured the naming of its vehicles with the expansion of its model portfolio. The numbers for electric models and combustion engines will be differentiated - even numbers will stand for electrically powered models and odd numbers for vehicles with combustion engines. With the introduction of the latest generation, the Audi A4, a longstanding bestseller, will be called the Audi A5 and will be produced in Neckarsulm. It is offered in four new variants: the A5 Sedan and S5 Sedan and the A5 Avant and S5 Avant. These variants are the first models to be launched on the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC).Audi CEO Gernot D\\u00f6llner on the new model family: \\\"In addition to expanding our all-electric portfolio, we are launching a new generation of models with efficient combustion engines. The Audi A5 family with its sporty design, completely new interior and future-proof electronics architecture will be the first. The advanced MHEV plus technology enables partially electric driving and therefore even more efficient driving.\\\"\\n2025 Audi A5 SedanIn terms of vehicle length, the Sedan and Avant are identical to the nearest millimeter. With an overall length of 4,829 millimeters, they have clearly grown to the dimensions of the upper midsize segment. The increase in length compared to the predecessor model is 67 millimeters. The long wheelbase of 2,900 millimeters with short overhangs reflects the premium proportions and contributes to both the long-distance qualities of driving comfort and the generous interior space.At the same time, Audi is increasing the value of the new A5. Many of our customers' favorite features are now standard equipment - such as navigation, an electrically opening and closing trunk lid, or the telephone tray with inductive charging. Optional extras allow the vehicle to be tailored to individual preferences.These include, for example, the 10.9-inch passenger display, the Bang & Olufsen Premium sound system with 3D sound and headrest speakers, the panoramic glass roof with segmented switchable transparency that almost completely spans the passenger compartment, or the electric steering column adjustment with memory function. Customers can also purchase special equipment bundles that build on each other.Dynamic and muscular exterior designEven at first glance, the totally redesigned A5 family has a powerful and clean design. The modified proportions with a long wheelbase, large wheels, and flat, sporty body embody progressive dynamism and premium standards. This is particularly evident in the side view thanks to the stretched hood, whose length gives it a prestigious appearance. The power of the optional quattro drivetrain, distributed to both axles, is visually manifested in the powerfully modeled and three-dimensionally flared blisters, which flow smoothly into the body of the new A5.In the Sedan, the sporty, compact-looking greenhouse (the roof structure) runs to the rear with a sweeping curve, flows seamlessly into the flat rear window like a coup\\u00e9, and ends at the visually short tailgate with a striking spoiler lip. The tailgate is a strong symbiosis of design and functionality, which is new in this vehicle segment. It opens with the rear window, and its size makes access to the luggage compartment considerably easier. This results in a completely new Sedan concept for Audi.In the Avant, the dynamically taut roofline merges into a form-fitting integrated roof spoiler that spans the sporty, shallow rear window. The correspondingly raked D-pillars, which sit firmly on the powerful rear quattro blisters, emphasize the dynamic side view of the A5 Avant.The front is dominated by the wide and significantly flatter proportioned Singleframe with a three-dimensional honeycomb structure - in the S5 with larger honeycombs and L-shaped inserts. Together with the slim and precisely drawn headlights, it shapes the face of the vehicle and gives it a striking and focused expression. The strong sweep of the front section creates the appearance of very short overhangs.Three-dimensionally modeled inlets for the air curtains are positioned under the headlights and give the bumper a powerful and sporty appearance. On the S5 and the S line exterior, they are accentuated even further by a wide intake duct painted in a contrasting color.Distinctive grooves in the hood called \\\"spooncuts\\\" emphasize the sporty character. Thanks to the soft nose integrated into the bumper, the hood is flush with the front end. This allows a greater distance between the hood and the Singleframe and, therefore, a visually lower, more dynamic face.The sculptural geometry under the rear window in the transition to the light strip visually emphasizes the width of the new Audi A5 with light and shadow effects, giving the new Audi A5 Avant a more resolute, dynamic character.On both body shapes, the side window graphics reinforce the sporty, elongated effect of the silhouette. The blisters protruding powerfully from the shoulder area at the front and rear wheels are reminiscent of the Audi Urquattro and a core element of the Audi design DNA. \\\"Making technology visible\\\" is a central design principle of the Four Rings.The new flush-mounted door handles, which enable the doors to be unlocked electrically via an inductive sensor, fit logically into the clear design. The exterior mirrors are positioned on the door waistline in a sports-car-like manner, thus completing the dynamic overall impression of the new Audi A5 from the side view in addition to the aerodynamic advantages. The sill area has a decidedly sporty design - a light edge under the doors structures the volume and lends the vehicle body visual lightness and agility. On the S line exterior and the S model, the sportiness is further enhanced by a color-contrasting sill trim.The striking, unmistakably styled rear combines sporty, emotional design and intelligent technology. The combination of the sculptural geometry in the rear end with the continuous, three-dimensionally offset light strip gives the rear of the new Audi A5 presence and visual dynamism. In the new S5 Sedan, a lip spoiler provides additional downforce.Further highlights visible from the rear are the clear, modern design of the bumper with a dark diffuser - even sportier on the S line exterior - and the high-quality, rectangular exhaust tips. On the TFSI, the exhaust tips are integrated into the diffuser on both sides; on the TDI variants, they appear as a rectangular twin tailpipe on the left-hand side of the vehicle. The S model has the iconic round twin tailpipes on the right and left in a new, sharpened design.Three exterior versions and eleven colorsThe range structure is divided into three exterior versions: basic, advanced, and S line exterior. The S model also has its own exterior. On the S line exterior and the S model, the front air intakes are larger, and the diffuser at the rear is significantly sportier. The sill trims for the S line exterior and S model also contribute to the dynamic character. The trims around the side windows are finished in anodized aluminum as standard. The S line exterior stands out with details in anodized matt anthracite aluminum, while the S model features design elements in anodized matt silver aluminum.The black exterior package is also available for the S line exterior and the S model. With this, the Audi rings at the front and rear are finished in anthracite gray. The radiator grille and the grill inserts, the sill trims, the door handles, the Singleframe and the diffuser at the rear, the window well trims, and the mirror housings are colored in black, as are the aluminum trim strips around the side windows. The exhaust system also features blacked-out tailpipe trims.There are eleven colors to choose from for the new Audi A5, including the Arkona White solid paint finish. Glacier White, Mythos Black, Chronos Gray, and new colors Grenadine Red and Horizon Blue are available as metallic paint finishes. Firmament Blue, Florett Silver, and Daytona Gray pearl effect, the latter of which is exclusively available for the S models or vehicles with S line exterior, complete the range.Audi Sport also offers Ascari Blue metallic for the S line exterior and S model. The new color Magnetic Grey is reserved exclusively for the \\\"Edition One\\\" with S line exterior and \\\"Edition One\\\" S models. The \\\"Edition One\\\" is a sporty special model for the Sedan and Avant, offered for two years, with exclusive design elements such as trim in a matte magnesium gray chrome look.Three equipment packages with tech optionsDepending on customers' choices, the new Audi A5 models can be ordered with different equipment packages that bundle a wide range of optional extras. The \\\"Tech\\\", \\\"Tech plus\\\" and \\\"Tech pro\\\" packages build on each other: In addition to exclusive options, the top-of-the-line \\\"Tech pro\\\" package also includes all the optional extras from the other packages.Highlights of the respective packages include:Tech: full LED headlights, 3-zone air conditioning, Audi MMI plusTech plus: Matrix LED headlights, passenger display, comfort package plusTech pro: Digital OLED rear lights, heated steering wheel, heated front and rear seats, adaptive damper controlThe wheel rangeThe new Audi A5 models on the German market roll on 17 and 18-inch light-alloy wheels as standard, depending on the exterior variant and engine specification. For the S line exterior and the S model, 19-inch wheels are standard. There is a choice of 17-inch wheels, also available with aero trims in Scandium Gray, three 18-inch wheels, five 19-inch wheels, and four 20-inch wheels. Audi Sport is responsible for two 19-inch and all 20-inch wheels, including an all-black 19-inch wheel. One highlight is the new forged Audi Sport wheel in 20-inch size. It is the only wheel in the portfolio with a tri-color design.The new interior design: technology meets comfortThe design of the new Audi A5 interior is based on four characteristic features. Firstly, the interior is designed to be human-centric, i.e., consistently geared toward the needs of its users. The second special feature is the Digital Stage, a digital stage clearly aligned in front of the driver and front passenger in the form of the Audi MMI displays. With its Material Driven Design, the new Audi A5 meets the demand for a generous sense of space with a high level of comfort. The interior's clear structure and logical operation also provide an overview in all situations and form the fourth feature: Visual Clarity.Human CentricThe clear structure of the new interior balances technology, aesthetics, and sustainability. The deliberate placement of elements in the foreground or background creates a three-dimensional spatial architecture individually tailored to the occupants in terms of design and ergonomics and conveys a generous sense of space.Digital StageThe digital stage with the Audi MMI panoramic display and the optional MMI passenger display shape the interior. The clearly positioned displays are perfectly integrated into the interior. The slim, free-standing Audi MMI panoramic display features a curved design and OLED technology. While the curved shape of the display ensures optimum accessibility of the touch area, the design of the outer contour creates a strong allusion to the typical Audi single frame.The panoramic display emphasizes the driver orientation of the dashboard and provides a sharpened cockpit feeling, giving the driver a perfect overview. Special ambient lighting sets the digital stage for the driver and makes the curved display appear to float.Below, the black panel architecture extends from the driver's side to the passenger side, creating space for the optional MMI passenger display. Active Privacy Mode allows the infotainment to be used while driving without visually distracting the driver. At the same time, it offers the option of supporting the driver with navigation tasks, for example. In the base version, a black high-gloss panel is installed here.Material Driven DesignAs a contrast and to balance the digital and technical areas, the new Audi A5 interior features the Softwrap. It runs from door to door across the entire dashboard width and visually stretches the interior horizontally. Together with the fabric panels in the door and the armrests, this creates a homely ambiance. The philosophy of Material Driven Design offers the potential to customize the interior according to your own ideas. The colors and high-quality materials of the interior can also be found in the seats in addition to the Softwrap.The materials were also selected from a functional point of view while ensuring a clear design differentiation of the various vehicle areas in the interior. Comfort-oriented areas are emphasized with generous surfaces and soft materials. In contrast, the precisely designed control areas are consistently finished in high-quality, high-gloss black to ensure the necessary clarity when interacting with the vehicle.The Smart Door Panel is an excellent example of this philosophy of materials. The black-panellook control element is integrated into the handle of the driver's door and blends seamlessly into the modern interior. It contains the most important functions, such as mirror settings, seat, and door functions, as well as light and visibility settings.Visual ClarityFunctionality and aesthetics can be found in the interior down to the smallest detail. This design approach is evident in the door opener and air vents. These are connected via a clasp that continues visually from the dashboard to the door trim. The contour light and the exit warning are also integrated into this finely crafted element.If optioned, the Bang & Olufsen lettering here is also illuminated. Low-lying, slim, horizontally aligned air vents harmoniously complete the overall picture. This highly premium area impressively demonstrates how the clever integration of functions leads to clarity in design.Interior light designThe clearly designed A5 interior is also showcased in the dark. The contour light in the dashboard and doors emphasizes the width of the interior. The indirect light below the MMI panoramic display and in the center console creates a visual floating effect. The premium materials in the doors are illuminated to great effect.In addition, there is the dynamic interaction light (IAL) with various functions to support the car's interaction with the occupants. It spans the entire interior width by means of a generous strip. LEDs are installed in the light strip, which means it fulfills three central functions. Firstly, it sets the scene for the interior. Secondly, the welcome function indicates when the vehicle is locked and unlocked. The IAL also provides support when it comes to safety. For example, the dynamic indicator light is visualized, but the IAL remains an additional display and does not replace a turn signal in the Virtual Cockpit. The dynamic interaction light is part of the ambient lighting package plus.New standards in digital lightWith the new A5, Audi is accentuating its leading role in lighting design and technology. The headlights and rear lights have a three-dimensional design and offer optional digital light signatures, bringing the physical and digital worlds together. At the front, the Audi A5 family optionally offers digital daytime running lights with LED technology and second-generation digital OLED rear lights at the rear.With around 60 segments per digital OLED panel, the A5 is increasingly acting as a display in the vehicle's rear. This enables car-to-x communication and increases road safety. A domain computer controls the communication light and the active digital light signature.In the case of the second-generation digital OLED rear lights, six OLED panels generate a new image several times per second through 364 segments using a specially developed algorithm. At the rear, all digital OLED segments are used for the active digital light signature. The luminous intensity within the combination rear light does not vary.With the second-generation digital OLED combination rear light, the Audi A5 family is taking lighting design, functionality, and, therefore, road safety in its class to a new level. The new digital OLED technology characterizes the appearance while also increasing the range of functions.The technology sets new standards in terms of personalization: With a total of eight digital light signatures included in the Matrix LED headlights combined with the digital OLED taillights, customers can personalize the appearance of their A5/S5 Sedan or A5/S5 Avant like never before. The selection is possible via the MMI touch display (Multi Media Interface) and the signatures can also be displayed via the myAudi app. The digital OLED tail lights of the new A5 can communicate with the immediate surroundings (Car-to-X).Audi has also taken the safety functions to a new level. The proximity detection known from the first generation of digital OLED rear lights has been extended in the A5 - the second generation of digital OLEDs - to include the communication light. For example, it warns other road users in advance of accidents and breakdowns.In addition to the regular taillight graphics, the communication light in the digital OLED rear light displays a specific static tail light signature with integrated warning symbols in critical driving or traffic situations. In the Audi A5, the brake lights are located behind the individual digital OLED panels - a unique arrangement for an Audi model. This creates a striking threedimensional shape with the LED tail light and the typically segmented digital light signature, which extends across the vehicle's full width, including the LED light strip.Audi MMI panoramic display and head-up displayThe slim, free-standing Audi MMI panoramic display has a curved design and OLED technology and consists of the Audi virtual cockpit with a 11.9-inch visible screen diagonal and the 14.5-inch MMI touch display.The display gives the interior a generous and airy feeling of space. With its curved shape, it is oriented towards the driver so that all functions can be operated easily without taking the eyes off the road for long. Special ambient lighting makes the Curved Display seem to float at night.Audi complements the digital stage for the front passengers with the optional 10.9-inch MMI front passenger display, which is also perfectly integrated into the dashboard design. This allows the front passenger to browse websites, stream video content, assist with navigation, or, for example, search for a gas station. The dynamic privacy mode prevents the driver from viewing distracting content, such as videos, while driving.The new Audi A5 can be optionally equipped with a new, advanced configurable head-up display (HUD). Audi is thus taking a major step forward in this display technology. The HUD can display a wide range of information, such as speed, active assistance systems, navigation instructions, or media data. For the first time, drivers have the option of controlling vehicle and infotainment functions via the Head-Up Display. The controls also allow scrolling through lists with direct selection using the steering wheel buttons. Thanks to the maximum utilization of the installation space and the adapted projection technology, the perceived image is more than 85 percent larger than before, and the projection is even more precise.The Audi assistant will also have access to additional online content in future, such as weather and general knowledge. The connection to ChatGPT (provided via Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service) brings knowledge from the Internet into the vehicle in natural language. The Audi assistant automatically recognizes whether a vehicle function is to be executed, a destination is to be searched for, or, for example, a weather forecast is to be called up. Only when the Audi system cannot answer general knowledge questions, for example, are they forwarded to ChatGPT. This is seamless for drivers, as all functions are integrated into the Audi assistant.E\\u00b3 enables high-performance networking of the vehicleWith the new electronic architecture E3 1.2 for the A5, customers experience digitalization in the vehicle more directly than ever before. The name E\\u00b3 stands for End-to-End Electronic Architecture. Its core elements are five high-performance computers, which Audi calls \\\"High Computing Performance\\\" (HCP). These computers cover all vehicle functions-from the powertrain and the assistance systems to the infotainment and comfort systems to the safety systems and back-end networking.The E\\u00b3 architecture is a scalable electronic architecture used throughout the Volkswagen Group. One development focus was on high-performance and secure networking of domain computers, control units, sensors, and actuators to manage more complex systems and maintain modularity. Another goal is a high-performance, seamless backend connection for car-to-x swarm data applications and computationally intensive offboard functions. Audi is gradually implementing the electronic architecture in all future vehicle models.Extensive range of driver assistance systemsAudi provides a wide range of driver assistance systems in the new A5, the functions of which significantly improve everyday life and road safety for all road users. A rear parking aid with distance display, cruise control and speed limiter, lane departure warning, efficiency assistant, and attention and drowsiness assistant are standard features from market launch.Additional assistance packages can be configured as an option. These include Adaptive cruise assist plus, which uses high-resolution map data and swarm data from other vehicles calculated in the cloud to optimize traffic sign recognition and assist with acceleration, maintaining speed and distance, and lane guidance. Active front assist combines four assistance functions: front emergency brake assist, evasion assist, turn assist, and front cross traffic assist. Other assistance systems available include traffic sign-based cruise control, park assist plus, and rear turn assist.Platform with efficient combustion engines and hybridizationThe new A5 series is based on the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC), a platform for conventionally powered vehicles with longitudinally mounted engines. This platform works with the E\\u00b3 architecture. At the same time, the PPC allows gradual electrification - initially in the form of mild hybrids. The PPC combines great variability and state-of-the-art technology with high economic viability.Lower consumption, more agility, and comfort with MHEV plusThe new MHEV plus system, based on a 48-volt onboard electrical system, simultaneously supports the combustion engine, reduces CO2 emissions, and increases performance. The new powertrain generator (PTG) enables partially electric driving, which reduces fuel consumption. The new MHEV plus system enables the A5 model series to achieve significant advantages in CO2 emissions and fuel consumption over an MHEV system. They total up to 10 g/km or 0.38 l/100 km for the 2.0 TDI (150 kW front-wheel drive/quattro) and up to 17 g/km or 0.74 l/100km for the V6 3.0 TFSI (270 kW quattro). The PTG can contribute up to 18 kW (24 PS) of electric power to the drive. When decelerating, the PTG recovers energy back into the battery through regenerative braking (recuperation) at up to 25 kW. On slight inclines and when maneuvering slowly, the car can be moved solely by the PTG.The electric powertrain can be partially used when driving slowly in the city, in slow-moving traffic, for example, on country roads, and when coasting towards a city limit. The PTG is attached directly to the transmission output shaft.Compared to the previous model, the recuperation power of up to 25 kW, made possible by the PTG, allows the battery to be recharged more quickly. This, in turn, can be used to propel the vehicle, power the electrical system, and sustain the air conditioning for a short time if required. This significantly reduces fuel consumption and, at the same time, increases comfort and performance.The response time when setting off is reduced, and the car is noticeably more agile. Another advantage of the system is the option of using an electric air conditioning compressor. This means that even when the combustion engine is switched off - for example, when costing or at a red light - the air conditioning can continue to operate at full power and keep the interior at a comfortable temperature.The integrated and blending-capable brake control system is used in all drivetrain variants. With this technology, the brake pedal and brake hydraulics are completely decoupled. On models with the MHEV plus system, it allows pressureless braking and achieves the necessary deceleration via recuperation alone - without using the friction brakes. The friction brake only kicks in when the brake pedal is pressed harder. The braking feel remains unaffected by this.The sophisticated operating strategy of the advanced hybrid system focuses not on electric range but on draining and filling the battery in fast cycles to always provide and recuperate enough electrical power. To ensure high charging and discharging performance of the 48-volt lithium iron phosphate battery, it is integrated into a low-temperature water cooling circuit that maintains the optimum operating temperature range of 25 to 45 degrees Celsius.Engine portfolio at market launchThe efficient engines in the Audi A5 family cover a wide range, from the conventional entry-level model to the comfortable long-distance runner and the dynamic sports car. The engine, transmission, degree of electrification, and drive type packages are geared towards our customers' expectations.The entry-level engine is a 2.0 TFSI with 110 kW (150 PS). This engine is optionally also available with 150 kW (204 PS). These TFSI engines are equipped with a turbocharger with variable turbine geometry (VTG) and work with a modified combustion process that is particularly fuel efficient under partial load. VTG technology enables a harmonious and agile torque build-up even at low engine speeds in gasoline engines. The turbo four-cylinder is available with a dual-clutch gearbox. The 110-kW variant is available as a purely front-wheel drive model, and the 150-kW variant with front-wheel or quattro ultra.The 2.0 TDI with 150 kW (204 PS) sets new standards in the A5 with its MHEV plus technology. This two-liter engine from the EA288 evo generation inherits the optimized combustion thanks to a cylinder pressure sensor, TwinDosing for exhaust emission control, and two balance shafts for smooth engine operation from its predecessor. It develops 400 Nm of torque between 1,750 and 3,250 rpm. The 2.0 TDI is available with a dual-clutch gearbox as a front-wheel or quattro ultra drive.The engine is partially electrified using the new 48-volt MHEV plus system to increase efficiency and comfort. The electric driving parts reduce CO2 emissions through high recuperation performance. In addition, the comfort of the TDI is further enhanced by a smooth engine start thanks to the 48-volt starter generator. The reaction time when setting off is reduced, and the car is noticeably more agile.The S5 as a sports car is based on a 3.0 V6 TFSI engine with 270 kW (367 PS) and an optimized combustion process, for the first time equipped with a turbocharger with variable turbine geometry (VTG) and MHEV plus technology. A strengthened S tronic dual-clutch transmission in the Audi S5 also lowers the weight on the front axle and makes the vehicle more agile.Partial electrification using the new 48-volt MHEV plus system reduces CO2 emissions thanks to its electrified drivetrain and high recuperation performance. Its fast, dynamic torque build-up underlines the sportiness of the S5. The standard use of a quattro sport differential with torque vectoring in combination with a variable all-wheel drive clutch is tuned for lateral dynamics at the highest level.More dynamic chassis and steering designThe handling characteristics typical of the Audi brand have also been further developed in the new A5. As a result of extensive detail work on the suspension and steering, the Audi A5 offers precise, effortless, and largely neutral handling, which can be differentiated significantly more between comfort and sportiness if the optional suspension with adaptive dampers is selected. From now on, only Audi progressive steering is used in the new A5.Stiffer steering and suspension mounts on the front axle ensure controlled and precise handling. In addition to the standard steel spring suspension, a sports suspension and the S sports suspension with adaptive damper control are available as options. The sports suspension is standard on the Audi A5 models with S line exterior and on the S models. Both variants of the sports suspension lower the trim level by 20 millimeters.The brake torque vectoring vehicle function developed by Audi, used for the first time in the Audi Q8 e-tron, noticeably improves driving. The system becomes active upon turning into a bend. As a result of the targeted braking intervention, the vehicle can turn in even more spontaneously and nimbly, counteracting understeer.In the entry-level version, the new Audi A5 is offered with 110 kW and purely front-wheel drive, while quattro ultra is available as an option on all other performance levels of the base models. This quattro technology distributes the drive torque flexibly to drive as efficiently as possible while fully utilizing all the advantages of all-wheel drive for maximum driving safety and dynamics.A multi-plate clutch can distribute torque between the front and rear axle in a wide range of ways- just as the respective driving situation requires. If the driving situation permits, the rear axle is automatically disengaged completely under partial load for maximum fuel efficiency. The quattro sport differential with torque vectoring, in combination with an adjustable all-wheel drive clutch, is fitted as standard in the S5 models. This gives the Audi S5 excellent lateral dynamics.Market launch and priceWith the new A5 family, Audi is beginning the next chapter of its successful history in the midsize segment. The new Audi A5 and Audi S5 will be launched in November 2024 in Germany and numerous other European countries.The Audi A5 family will be available to order in Germany from July 2024. The Audi A5 Sedan TFSI 110 kW will be offered in Germany at an entry price starting at EUR 45,200 and will include navigation, an electric trunk lid, and a telephone tray with inductive charging as standard.READ MORE\\nLatest cars (16-07-2024) 2025 Audi A5 Avant (16-07-2024) 2025 Audi A5 Sedan (16-07-2024) 2025 Audi S5 Avant (16-07-2024) 2025 Audi S5 Sedan (16-07-2024) 2025 Dacia Spring (12-07-2024) 2025 Toyota GR86 Hakone Edition (12-07-2024) 2025 Ford Raptor T1 Dakar Rally (11-07-2024) 2025 Fiat Grande Panda (11-07-2024) 2025 Mercedes-Benz AMG GT63 PRO (11-07-2024) 2023 Audi Auto Union Type 52 (11-07-2024) 2024 MG Cyber GTS Concept (11-07-2024) 2025 MG HSshow more...[ Terms of Use | Privacy Policy ]\\u00a9 2005-2024\\n\\n\\n\",\n        \"type\": \"Document\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"lc\": 1,\n      \"type\": \"constructor\",\n      \"id\": [\n        \"langchain\",\n        \"schema\",\n        \"document\",\n        \"Document\"\n      ],\n      \"kwargs\": {\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"source\": \"https://uk.pcmag.com/monitors/9527/the-best-computer-monitors\",\n          \"title\": \"The Best Monitors for 2024\",\n          \"description\": \"Make the most of your work, games, or movies with the right monitor.

It can charge a laptop over its USB-C display connection, and it even provides Ethernet connectivity should you be in an office with spotty Wi-Fi. What\\u2019s more, it has a 27-inch 4K (UHD) screen with a high pixel density and wide color gamut. All that, plus it\\u2019s one of the first two monitors to incorporate IPS Black, LG\\u2019s latest flavor of in-plane switching (IPS) technology. It provides far better contrast than standard IPS displays. About the only common business feature it is missing is a webcam, but only a select few desktop displays have one.Who It's ForThe U2723QE sells at a high enough price that you\\u2019re not likely to outfit a whole office with them. It would be a good choice for meeting-heavy managers (or other critical workers), especially ones involved in dealing with creative content as one aspect of their job. It\\u2019s not a full-on graphic-arts monitor, but it is fine for photo and video work in a pinch, and it's an easy attach/detach for a frequently toted laptop.ProsIPS Black technology deepens black levels, improves contrast4K resolution with sharp high-pixel-density imageExtensive ergonomic featuresDual DisplayPort connectors let you daisy-chain monitorsMini-joystick controller for OSDConsPricey for a 27-inch monitorNo webcamGet It NowSee ItLearn MoreDell UltraSharp 27 4K USB-C Hub Monitor (U2723QE) Review\\nHP E27m G4 QHD USB-C Conferencing MonitorBest Business Monitor for Teleconferencing4.5 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItThe HP E27m G4 is built for the age of Zoom and Google Meet. Its hi-res webcam, powerful speakers, and dual microphones provide a better teleconferencing experience than what you'll get from most laptops. In addition, it has the ability to power or charge a laptop over a USB-C connection. It adds Ethernet connectivity, multiple video ports, and a quartet of USB-A downstream ports to which you can connect a keyboard, mouse, and other peripherals. In short, it has all the connection choices you\\u2019d expect from a laptop\\u2019s docking station, and that's before you even get to the screen.The E27m G4\\u2019s 27-inch QHD screen effectively covers the full sRGB color space, and its contrast was slightly better than its rating would indicate. It has all the essential ergonomic features as well. Its main downside is the small and inconveniently placed buttons for navigating the onscreen display (OSD).Who It's ForThe E27m G4 is a great choice for anyone involved in videoconferencing\\u2014and who isn't, these days? It's especially good if you have problems being heard or seen in teleconferences. (Personally, my next monitor is likely to be a conferencing model such as this one to ensure that I am well seen and heard, and that my colleagues are, too.) It's a fine general-purpose office monitor as well. If you're cramped for space, HP has the 1080p HP E24m G4 FHD USB-C Conferencing Monitor, which has all the teleconferencing features of its larger sibling.Pros27-inch QHD panel with good sRGB color coverage5-megapixel tilt-adjustable webcamDual 5-watt speakers and echo-canceling microphonesUSB-C port with power delivery and DisplayPort, plus four-port USB-A hubEthernet connectivityErgonomically friendly standConsSmall buttons inconveniently placedGet It NowSee ItLearn MoreHP E27m G4 QHD USB-C Conferencing Monitor Review\\nHP 24mh 23.8-inch 1080p FHD MonitorBest Budget Home-Office Monitor4.0 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItYou'll find plenty of under-$200 business and general-purpose monitors with screens in the 24-inch range. As a rule, they have very basic features and limited port selections. The HP 24mh offers more than most, adding a DisplayPort connector to the usual HDMI and VGA ports found on similar machines. While most budget monitors offer tilt adjustment, the 24mh adds both height and pivot control. Like most of its ilk, the 24mh has a 1080p IPS panel, not a 4K UHD one, but it makes up for that with impressive sRGB coverage and a contrast ratio well above its rating. It has a pair of built-in 2-watt speakers\\u2014not exactly high-fidelity, but many budget monitors don't include speakers at all.Who It\\u2019s ForThe HP 24mh is for cash-strapped individuals looking for a monitor that's a good value and will fit on a small desk. It's a good option for households, home offices, and dorms. Its sRGB color coverage is great, so it's good for photo viewing or basic editing. Users who can afford one should opt for a more full-featured monitor, but the HP 24mh offers more than you'd typically get for its bargain-basement price.ProsExcellent sRGB color coverageHigh contrast ratio for an IPS monitorDisplayPort, HDMI, and VGA connectorsStand supports height, pivot, and tilt adjustmentBuilt-in 2-watt speakersConsWarranty limited to one yearBrightness fell short of its ratingGet It NowSee ItLearn MoreHP 24mh 23.8-inch 1080p FHD Monitor Review\\nAlienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLEDBest Gaming Monitor4.5 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItOLED has proven itself to be an impressive screen technology on TVs and desktop displays alike, and Alienware\\u2019s 32-inch QD-OLED panel is our favorite of the moment among gaming models. A stunning 4K OLED screen made mightier by a high refresh rate (240Hz), it's well positioned between the huge 40-plus-inchers and the 27-inch baseline for gaming displays. No, it's not cheap, but its excellent color-gamut coverage, low input lag, and great HDR support seal the deal. More great OLEDs are due to hit throughout 2024, but this one earned our Editors' Choice award and a 4.5-star score in the early going. The game is on.Who It's ForDeep-pocketed gamers looking for a high-refresh, stunning-looking monitor for the ages with a conventional aspect ratio are the target for this exceptional eye-candy panel.ProsExcellent color accuracy and color gamutLow input lagHigh HDR brightnessDistinctive aestheticsConsExpensiveGet It NowSee ItLearn MoreAlienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED Review\\nDell 27 Curved Gaming Monitor (S2721HGF)Best Budget Gaming Monitor4.0 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItThe Dell 27 S2721HGF may have just a middle-range screen size (27 inches on the diagonal) for a gaming-oriented panel, but it includes many of the other elements that gamers seek, including a graceful curve, at a great price. A VA panel with 1080p resolution and a 144Hz refresh rate, it is both AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync compatible. It serves up very good gaming performance for the money, and showed very little ghosting or screen tearing during our testing.Who It\\u2019s ForThis Dell is laser-focused on the cash-strapped gaming set. Its contrast ratio is only so-so, and the cabinet and stand lack frills, but those are standard issues with monitors in this price range. Colors are balanced and natural, motion playback is smooth, and measured input lag is extremely low. It ticks all the boxes for a satisfying and very affordable gaming monitor.ProsInexpensive for a 27-inch high-refresh gaming panelVery low input lagExcellent Nvidia G-Sync performanceConsMediocre contrastGet It NowSee ItLearn MoreDell 27 Curved Gaming Monitor (S2721HGF) Review\\nHP E45c G5 DQHD Curved MonitorBest Ultrawide Monitor4.5 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItThe HP E45c G5 DQHD Curved Monitor, a 45-inch business-centric ultrawide monitor, is a good substitute for two individual QHD monitors while retaining some of the benefits of multiple monitors via unique virtual dual-display and KVM features. Its super-ultrawide 32:9 panel renders a bright image, with good contrast and full sRGB color coverage. The E45c has excellent ergonomics for an ultrawide, with its stand providing as much ergonomic flexibility as you can expect from such a wide monitor. Plus, you'll find a range of connection choices that you'd expect from a separate laptop docking station. The E45c's screen isn't quite as wide as the more common 49-inch displays we have reviewed, but its size is more manageable, particularly for home offices or other tight spaces.Who It\\u2019s ForThe HP E45c G5 fits in either a traditional office setting or a home office, and can perform many operations that usually require dual monitors thanks to its split-screen modes.ProsBrightFull sRGB color coverageTwo USB-C ports provide up to 100W USB power deliveryUSB-A hub165Hz refresh rateUnique software, including KVM functionalityIntuitive mini joystick controllerConsNo webcamLearn MoreHP E45c G5 DQHD Curved Monitor Review\\nLenovo ThinkVision M14dBest Portable Monitor4.0 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItThe Lenovo ThinkVision M14d doesn't have the range of controls of some other portable displays, and its 14-inch screen isn't the largest among portable monitors. But it's bright, features high color fidelity, can be tilted to a wide range of angles, and is very light and easy to transport. Its color accuracy (96% of sRGB) is much better than that of most portable panels we have reviewed. The screen cabinet rests on a hinged base on which the ports and controls reside, and you can tilt the screen away from you at any angle you desire, down to flat. Connectors include two USB-C ports, including one that supports USB Power Delivery as well as DisplayPort over USB-C. And it has a 16:10 aspect ratio to match the squarer screens of late-model laptops. (Lenovo's ThinkVision m14, without the \\\"d,\\\" adheres to a wider 16:9 format.) Who It\\u2019s ForThe Lenovo M14d is a good pick for anyone looking for a secondary monitor for home or travel use. (For the latter, Lenovo includes a soft traveling sleeve.) It is particularly good if you want reasonably good color fidelity for photo viewing and editing or movie watching. It's also aimed at people who want simplicity, since the attached, hinged stand is much easier to use than the folding, \\\"origami-style\\\" stands commonly found on portable monitors.ProsHigh (2.2K) resolution for a portable monitorBright with high contrastSturdy hinged stand with great tilt rangeSupports USB power delivery and DisplayPort over USBConsPriceyLimited to USB-C connectivityGet It NowSee ItLearn MoreLenovo ThinkVision M14d Review\\nApple Pro Display XDRBest Professional Graphics Monitor4.0 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItApple's Pro Display XDR provides exceptional color accuracy and build quality at a price that's competitive compared with reference-grade pro monitors, though beyond the budget of typical users. (The stand alone costs an extra grand!) It has no buttons, and ports are limited to USB-C and Thunderbolt. Don't even bother to connect a non-Mac computer to it. So why buy it? It covers nearly the full DCI-P3 color space, designed for digital video. In HDR testing, we recorded a peak burst brightness of 1,561 nits, while its peak SDR brightness was a \\\"mere\\\" 499 nits. Color accuracy was amazing; its Delta E result in each of the three color modes we test\\u2014sRGB, Adobe RGB, and DCI-P3\\u2014was less than 1.0. Its LED-backlit screen makes use of a technology called full-array local dimming (FALD), which allows the monitor to dim individual screen areas as needed instead of doing it globally.Who It\\u2019s ForWith its stratospheric price tag, 6K resolution, and standout color accuracy, the Pro Display XDR has a very specific target market: professional Mac-based content creators. In fact, it only officially works with Apple devices. If you're a Mac creator and don't have the small fortune needed for the XDR, look to the Apple Studio Display, which is still pricey but a pittance compared with the XDR. Windows-based creators should look to the likes of the Asus ProArt PA34VC Professional Curved Monitor instead.

Its IPS panel is bright, with excellent contrast and full sRGB color coverage. The P2424HT\\u2019s cleverly designed stand folds, so you can in effect switch it from a desktop monitor into a tablet-like mode. Connections include an Ethernet jack, two USB-C ports (the upstream one supplying up to 90 watts of USB power delivery), an HDMI port, a DisplayPort connector, three USB-A ports, and a headphone jack.Who It\\u2019s ForThe Dell 24 Touch P2424HT is an affordable touch-screen desktop monitor for general-purpose business or personal use. It has a bright IPS screen with excellent contrast and full coverage of the sRGB color space, but its relatively low (FHD, aka 1080p) resolution limits its artistic use to casual photo or video editing, and if you want a stylus, you\\u2019ll have to supply your own.

It employs a 27-inch (diagonal) panel with 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) resolution at a 16:9 aspect ratio and 120Hz refresh rate. In testing, it was reasonably bright at 344 nits and covered the full Adobe RGB and sRGB color spaces and 97.4% of the DCI-P3 digital video space. The Pro 27 includes the Wacom Pro Pen 3 stylus, which has 8,192 pressure levels and requires no charging, using the company\\u2019s Electromagnetic Resonance (EMR) technology to work with the screen. The Pro 27 is unparalleled amongst pen-based interactive displays geared to serious, stylus-centric graphics work.\\u00a0Who It's ForWith a $3,500 price ($4,000 if you include the stand, which you\\u2019ll definitely want to get unless you mount the display on a VESA arm), this monitor is targeted toward professional graphic artists and video editors, for whom it should prove an invaluable tool. That said, it should delight any graphic arts aficionado or student who can pony up the Cintiq Pro 27\\u2019s hefty fee and find a place to fit this behemoth, which measures 15 by 25 inches (HW) and weighs 35 pounds (including the stand).ProsFantastic resolution and colorHighly accurate stylus and screen interactionUseful customizable controls on both display and stylusStylus ships with custom grips, replacement nibsWell-designed appConsExpensive, even without the standHuge and heavyLearn MoreWacom Cintiq Pro 27 Review\\nBuying Guide: The Best Monitors for 2024\\n\\n\\nReady to get started shopping? Regardless of the type of monitor you're eyeing, some general factors are worth considering. Here's a rundown of key areas to keep in mind.What Are the Price Ranges for Different Monitor Types?Monitor prices depend on the target audience, screen size, and the features of the display. You can pick up a no-frills 22-inch or 23-inch display for $100 or less, but don't expect such a monitor to provide niceties such as a wide variety of ports\\u00a0and a height-adjustable stand. Even so, such panels today do feature LED backlighting, draw little power, and are often bright enough for everyday applications. Performance is adequate for most entertainment or basic business and productivity purposes, but not well suited to tasks where color accuracy is key.(Credit: Zlata Ivleva)At the other end of the spectrum are high-end monitors geared toward graphic design professionals and photographers. Most of these are 27-inch to 38-inch panels that support 4K resolution (usually 3,840 by 2,160 pixels), capable of displaying four times the resolution of a typical full HD or 1080p (1,920-by-1,080-pixel) monitor. Moreover, they offer such features as highly adjustable stands, a range of ports including HDMI, DisplayPort, Thunderbolt, and USB (often including USB-C), and a wealth of advanced image settings, sometimes including color calibration hardware and software. (Credit: Molly Flores)You can expect to pay at least $500 or more for a fully loaded, high-performance 4K or ultra-high-definition (UHD) monitor. Top-of-the-line professional monitors, some packing up to 6K resolution (around 6,000 horizontal pixels), generally cost between $2,000 and $6,000. If you're serious about PC or console gaming, you can find gaming monitors at just about every price point you can imagine. A few budget models go as low as $99, while ultra-premium offerings come closer than ever to merging the worlds of \\\"gaming monitor\\\" and \\\"HDTV.\\\" Of all the display categories, gaming monitors encompass the broadest spectrum of prices and feature sets, all serving slightly different markets.Bottom line? Be prepared to pay for extras, but don't overspend on features you'll never use.What Size Monitor Do I Need?Desktop computer monitors generally fall between 19 and 43 inches measured diagonally, although users with extra-large desks can choose among ultrawide displays in sizes up to 57 inches. Some displays are smaller than 19 inches; they're either specialty panels (such as those intended for use with a Raspberry Pi)\\u00a0or USB-connected portable displays\\u00a0meant to be carried alongside laptops.While it's always nice to have as large a viewing area as possible, a jumbo monitor may not be practical given your desktop-space constraints. Besides, the bigger the screen, the more you can expect to pay. A 22- or 24-inch monitor is a good choice if you wish to view multipage documents or watch streaming video but have limited desk space and a tight budget. But there's nothing like watching a movie or playing a game on a big screen, so if you have room on your desk, a 27-inch or 32-inch display delivers a superior viewing experience for a reasonable price. If space is not an issue, consider a massive curved monitor to bring a true movie-theater experience to your desktop.(Credit: Molly Flores)If you're looking to replace a dual-monitor setup with a single display, check out one of the ultrawide models. These are available in panel sizes ranging from 29 to 57 inches, in both curved and flat varieties, feature aspect ratios of 21:9 or 32:9 instead of the familiar 16:9, and come in a variety of resolutions including 4K/UHD and Wide Quad High-Definition (WQHD, or 2,560 by 1,440 pixels). Some of these are built for productivity apps, while others are gaming-oriented. (More on the latter later.)Do I Need a Low Pixel Response Rate?Measured in milliseconds (ms), pixel response rate is the time it takes for a display pixel to change from black to white (black-to-white response time) or to transition from one shade of gray to another (gray-to-gray response time). The faster the pixel response rate, the better the monitor will be at displaying video without showing artifacts such as ghosting or blurring of moving images. Monitors with a fast 1ms gray-to-gray response are ideal for gaming, but even monitors rated at a 6ms gray-to-gray pixel response can show games without much blurring or ghosting.Most users won't notice input lag, which is the time it takes for the display to react to a command, but hardcore gamers consider it a key factor and typically seek out the fastest models (lowest lag time) available. The fastest monitor we've seen has an input lag of less than a millisecond, but for everyday apps, you can get by with 20ms to 25ms before lag becomes a noticeable problem.Which Monitor Resolution and Aspect Ratio Is Best for What I Do? These two factors are always intertwined but carry different considerations.ResolutionA monitor's native resolution is the maximum number of pixels it can display, both horizontally and vertically. For example, a monitor with a 1,920-by-1,080-pixel native resolution shows 1,920 pixels across the width of the screen and 1,080 from top to bottom. The higher the resolution, the more information can be displayed on the screen.These days, many monitors in the 22-to-27-inch range have a native resolution of 1,920 by 1,080 pixels and are referred to as full HD or 1080p displays. You'll also see plenty of displays from 24 to 32 inches that offer WQHD (2,560-by-1,440-pixel or 1440p) native resolution. Stepping up to a UHD or 4K (3,840-by-2,160-pixel) monitor usually means a 27-inch or larger screen, although we've seen a few 24-inch models. UHD monitors are ideal for viewing highly detailed images or looking at multiple pages in a tiled or side-by-side format.(Credit: Molly Flores)Aspect RatioThe best aspect ratio for your monitor depends on how you intend to use it most. For digital content creators, a 16:10 ratio might be preferable (offering a bit extra vertical space for toolbars and such). But the 16:9 aspect ratio of 1080p and 4K screens is by far the most common among desktop monitors, though that dominance has been chipped away in recent years by the ultrawide formats.(Credit: Zlata Ivleva)As ultrawide panels with 21:9 aspect ratios have reached the top of the wish lists of both gamers (especially simulation gamers) and productivity users, monitor manufacturers have responded in kind, and what used to be a fringe aspect ratio is becoming increasingly popular, Ultrawide monitors are impressive in their own right, but for people who want the ultimate productivity panel or an immersive gaming experience unlike any other, a 32:9  monitor might be the way to go. Still, these super-wide panels are causing even old-school enthusiasts to ask themselves, \\\"How wide is too wide?\\\"Which Major Features Should I Look for in a Monitor?If you have to share a display with a coworker or family member, consider a model with an ergonomic stand that lets you position the screen for your most comfortable viewing angle. A fully adjustable stand offers tilt, swivel, and height adjustments, and lets you pivot or rotate the screen between landscape and portrait (horizontal and vertical) orientation. If you tend to attach and detach USB devices often, look for a monitor with built-in USB ports. Ideally, at least two of these ports will be mounted on the side of the cabinet, making it easy to plug in flash drives and other USB peripherals.(Credit: Molly Flores)Many monitors come with built-in speakers that are adequate for everyday use but lack the volume and bass response to satisfy music aficionados and gamers. If audio output is important, look for speakers with a minimum rating of 2 watts per speaker. As a general rule, the higher the power rating, the more volume you can expect, so if you want a monitor with a little extra audio pop, check the specs. Some monitors lack speakers altogether, but you can add external speakers that may give you better sound than typical monitor speakers. Finally, glossy-surfaced screens can provide very bright, crisp colors, but they may also be too reflective for some users. If possible, compare a glossy screen to a matte screen before you buy to decide which works best for you.Do I Need High Dynamic Range (HDR)?Many monitors come with a feature known as high dynamic range or HDR, which can drastically boost the vividness and contrast of a display depending on the rating. Here's how the rating system (established by VESA) breaks out :HDR has been creeping into more and more PC gaming and content creation monitors over the past few years. While we've found that many of them would be better off not including it at all, the HDR adoption rate in monitors resembles that of HDR televisions starting in 2017. Theoretically, once similar panel-scale economics kick in, monitors with higher HDR ratings could also come down in price. Until then, if HDR matters to you, we recommend buying monitors only with an HDR 600 rating or above to give you an experience comparable to that of a modern HDR-rated TV. An HDR certification will always add to a monitor's MSRP, so unless you really want the feature and are ready to pay for a proper rating, that money could be better saved for upgrades to your PC or added features such as a higher refresh rate for a gaming display. What Are the Different Kinds of Monitor Panels?With cathode-ray tubes (CRTs) long since replaced by flat panels, the key panel types used in desktop displays are twisted nematic (TN), in-plane switching (IPS) and iterations such as Fast IPS, vertical alignment (VA), and organic light-emitting diode (OLED) plus variations such as QD-OLED.(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)Until not long ago, most desktop displays used TN technology. It's the least expensive panel type to manufacture and it offers superior motion-handling performance. But affordable IPS monitors are out in force; today's 27-inch IPS displays start at under $150 and offer very good color quality and wide viewing angles. VA monitors also offer robust colors, but their viewing angles, though wider than those of a typical TN panel, aren't quite as broad as IPS technology offers.Most recently, we've seen a growing trend of what's colloquially called Fast IPS (or Rapid IPS or Nano IPS). These displays combine the vivid colors of IPS tech with the fast pixel response times and low input lag of TN and VA displays. They offer the best of both worlds. Another IPS variant, IPS Black, is notable for its ability to render deep black hues, offering a native 2,000:1 contrast ratio, twice that of standard IPS. We are seeing IPS Black mostly on high-end productivity and graphic arts monitors. And speaking of high contrast, OLED monitors have the ability to turn individual pixels on and off, offering a theoretically infinite contrast ratio. OLED panels do a magnificent job at rendering detail in darker scenes.Today, you'd be hard-pressed to find a desktop monitor that doesn't deliver at least full HD resolution (1,920 by 1,080 pixels in a 16:9 aspect ratio). Graphic design pros who demand a high degree of image detail should be looking further up the resolution stack for a WQHD or UHD/4K display, except in the case of small-screen or portable monitors. As important as the sheer number of pixels is the pixel density, or how closely the pixels are packed together. For professional monitors, we recommend a pixel density of greater than 100 pixels per inch (ppi).(Credit: Zlata Ivleva)We're now seeing monitors that make use of quantum dot technology to offer superior color accuracy, an increased color gamut, and higher peak brightness than you can get with current panel technologies. Another newer technology, Mini LED, uses thousands of tiny light-emitting diodes arranged in a matrix, brightened and dimmed in small groups as the video signal changes. In addition, desktop (and a few portable) monitor vendors are following a growing number of laptop makers in adopting organic light-emitting diode (OLED) technology, which offers ultra-high contrast, super-fast pixel response, and true blacks. (Black OLED pixels are literally turned off, with no backlight bleeding through behind them.) (Credit: Molly Flores)As mentioned, for laptop users who require dual-screen capabilities a portable monitor might be a better fit than a full-size desktop panel. These lightweight devices use your PC's USB port (most recent models employ USB-C) as their source for power and in some cases the video signal as well. (Others support HDMI input.) They're ideal for small-office presentations and for extending your laptop's screen real estate, and their slim profiles make them easy to travel with. For less than $200, you can get a 15-inch model that will let you double your viewing area while on the road. (See how we test monitors.)Monitor Ports and Cables: Picking the Right InterfaceNext up: how you'll actually connect your new monitor to your computer or other device. This equation is anything but simple, and often leads to confused buyers spending more than they need on marketing mumbo-jumbo. For most monitors released in the last five years or so, HDMI is the dominant interface that is used to connect a desktop or laptop PC, streaming device, or gaming console. While both monitors and devices compatible with the rival DisplayPort spec are plentiful, HDMI is the cable and port type that you can depend on to most likely get you hooked up, even if you don't know what the available ports look like on the back of, say, an Xbox. Monitor and device manufacturers have moved away from the antique VGA and DVI standards, which are still seen on the occasional budget business panel or projector but can't display the higher resolutions and refresh rates we've grown accustomed to. Let's pause for more about refresh rate. It means the number of times per second the screen is redrawn, measured in hertz or cycles per second, and is a key factor in interface choice. Until recently, most monitors topped out at 60Hz, and their default bundled cables were up to the task. But with gaming monitors now routinely pushing 144Hz or even 360Hz and above, and many non-gaming panels able to go above 60Hz, paying attention to the different flavors of HDMI and DisplayPort is more important than ever.In brief, HDMI 1.4a, 1.4b, 2.0a, and 2.0b will get you at least a 1080p signal at 30Hz. Cables and inputs that work with these standards are not hard to find; you'd have better luck digging a pre-1.4a HDMI cable out of a bin at your local computer salvage shop than from the shelves of any electronics store. This in-depth guide to HDMI flavors by our TV-reviewing colleague Will Greenwald should help to clear things up on cable compatibility, while those interested in using a version of DisplayPort should keep reading here. (Credit: Molly Flores)DisplayPort 1.4a and 1.4b are commonly used in DisplayPort monitors, and they're supported by the largest number of graphics cards and streaming devices. PC gamers and discriminating users who appreciate high refresh rates rely on them for their high bandwidth, as the more bandwidth a cable supports the more pixels it can deliver at a higher refresh rate. DisplayPort 1.4a and 1.4b are capable of transmitting today's popular video resolutions (1080p, 1440p, and 4K), at up to 165Hz for 4K and a whopping 390Hz for 1080p. By contrast, HDMI 2.0b maxes out at 60Hz for 4K. HDMI 2.1, a standard frequently found in newer graphics cards, gaming consoles, monitors, and TVs, supports 4K at 120Hz.Some newer monitors have DisplayPort 2.0 ports, which support 8K resolution at a staggering 240Hz,16K with HDR at 60Hz, and 10K without HDR at 80Hz. The recently introduced DisplayPort 2.1 is largely the same as DisplayPort 2.0 but with the addition of USB4 compatibility.Finally, there's something called DisplayPort over USB Alternate Mode, most commonly seen in laptops that lack DisplayPort or HDMI connectors. This video-transfer method is most commonly found in a configuration of a USB-C cable that connects a computer to a USB-compatible monitor. This method currently maxes out at 60Hz/8K, though as with the other cable standards we've mentioned, we expect those numbers to climb in the future.(Credit: Molly Flores)Before we close out this section, a quick note on Display Stream Compression (DSC). We won't bore you with the cable-by-cable mathematics of it all, but just know that DSC allows for higher refresh rates without losing visual quality. The main thing is just to keep an eye out for DSC on your next monitor, as it's always better to have the feature than not (and it doesn't add much cost). It's primarily a feature of gaming monitors for now, but you can expect to see it added to creative and productivity displays when 8K resolution becomes more common.In short (or long, depending on the cable): Cable length, version, output source, input port, and your monitor's refresh rate can all affect the interface that's right for your needs. Check the specs on any panel you're looking at for support for the resolution, refresh rate, and interface you intend to use, make sure the cable you need is bundled, and if you'll be working or playing at high resolutions and refresh rates on HDMI, hit up the HDMI guide referenced above.The Main Monitor Categories, ExplainedYou can classify most monitors into five categories, all of which target different audiences: Budget, Business/Professional, Touch Screen, General Use/Multimedia, and Gaming. Prices vary within each category, depending on the screen size, the panel technology used, and extra features.What Is the Best Budget Monitor? If you're looking for a basic monitor for viewing emails, surfing the web, and displaying office applications, there's no reason to overspend on a screen with features you'll never use. Budget displays are usually no-frills models that lack niceties such as USB ports, card readers, and built-in webcams. Some cheaper models use TN panel technology and are not known for their performance, particularly when it comes to motion handling and grayscale accuracy. That said, IPS panels have become common in the budget zone at each screen size.Don't expect much in the way of flexibility. Most budget displays are supported by a rigid stand that may provide tilt but probably won't offer height and pivot adjustments. As with nearly all displays, costs will rise along with panel size. You can buy a simple 24-inch panel for $100 or less, while budget 27-inch screens are available for less than $150.What Is the Best Monitor for Work? This category includes a wide variety of monitor types. They can be small-screen, energy-conscious \\\"green\\\" models for everyday office use. Or they can be high-end, high-priced, 32-inch and larger professional-grade displays that use indium gallium zinc oxide (IGZO) or advanced high-performance in-plane switching (AH-IPS) panel technology and cater to graphics professionals who require a high degree of color and grayscale accuracy. (Credit: Zlata Ivleva)Business monitors usually offer ergonomic stands that can be adjusted for maximum comfort. Often, they'll offer pivot adjustability, which lets you rotate the screen 90 degrees for viewing in portrait mode. Look for a monitor with an auto-rotate feature that flips the image for you when you change the orientation. Other business-centric features include a generous (three- or four-year) warranty with an overnight exchange service, built-in USB ports, and an aggressive recycling program.A fully loaded model with a high-end panel is going to cost plenty, but for photographers and other graphics pros, it's money well spent. At the other end of the price spectrum are no-frills, energy-efficient monitors; they don't offer much in the way of features, but their low power draw can help businesses save money through reduced energy costs. (For more, check out our guide to the best business monitors.)What Is the Best Monitor for Home Working?Many of the same considerations come into play for a display you'll use for telecommuting. Unlike a panel for use strictly in the office, you might want to emphasize the video-calling aspect in a monitor you'll use for working from home. (That might mean a built-in camera, if you don't have an aftermarket one you like.)You might also want to look for thin bezels around the panel if you are considering a multi-monitor setup. The best computer monitors for dual setup have thin bezels to keep a distracting bar from bisecting your line of site. Since this is at home, that same monitor may be used for after-hours fun or productivity work, too, so be sure to look for other features as detailed in those relevant sections. A gaming monitor can serve well as a work-from-home monitor, but likely less so vice-versa.   What Is the Best Touch-Screen Monitor? Touch-screen desktop displays have gained some traction, but mostly in vertical markets. You'll pay a bit more for touch technology, but it's worth it if you care about the Windows touch experience. Look for a model equipped with a stand that lets you position the panel so it's almost parallel with your desktop if you need that kind of interaction. (Some touch models are designed\\u00a0without\\u00a0a stand, meant to be integrated into a specific environment with a custom stand or mounting arm.) (Credit: Zlata Ivleva)More common than true desktop touch screens, though, are portable touch-screen monitors, both for general-purpose use and for graphic artists. (See our guide to portable monitors.)What Is the Best Monitor for Multimedia? Multimedia displays typically offer a nice selection of features to help you create and view home photo and video projects. A good panel of this kind will usually provide a variety of connectivity options, primary among them HDMI and DisplayPort. Robust entertainment models will also include audio connections. At least two USB ports should be available, preferably mounted on the side of the cabinet for easy access; a USB Type-C port that lets you, say, charge a laptop from your monitor while permitting two-way data transfer is another big plus.(Credit: Molly Flores)The monitor may also have built-in speakers. On a good multimedia panel, they should be a cut above the typical low-powered versions found on most monitors. As mentioned earlier, if audio output is a deciding factor, look for displays with speakers rated at 2 watts or better. Less common multimedia bells and whistles to look out for include a built-in memory card reader, which makes it easy to view photos and video directly from your digital camera, or a built-in webcam for video chats and for taking quick stills and videos that are easy to email. These are uncommon, however. (If you're a serious photographer, check out our picks in the lists above and below this article for photography-friendly displays.)What Is the Best Monitor for Gaming?Displays for gaming require fast response times in order to display moving images without producing motion errors or artifacts. Panels with slower response times may produce blurring of fast-moving images, which can be distracting during gameplay. The flaw may not be so noticeable on smaller displays, but when you're gaming on a 27-inch or larger screen, you'll want to keep blurring to a minimum. Look for a panel with a response time of no more than 5ms (black-to-white) or 2ms (gray-to-gray).(Credit: Molly Flores)High-end gaming monitors may offer support for Nvidia's G-Sync or AMD's FreeSync and FreeSync 2 technologies that synchronize your monitor and graphics card to reduce screen-tearing artifacts and provide an ultra-smooth gaming experience, but your computer will need a compatible dedicated GPU to take advantage of that functionality.Most gaming monitor vendors now offer displays that feature refresh rates above the 60Hz norm. (Indeed, some recent general-purpose, non-gaming monitors offer 75Hz or higher.) They're geared toward esports aficionados or serious competitive gamers who demand the highest number of frames per second available. (Depending on the games you play, you may need a high-end graphics card to see the benefits of a high-refresh display; see\\u00a0our guide to the best graphics cards.) These high-refresh monitors are offered in various refresh intervals ranging from 75Hz to more than 500Hz, with 144Hz and 165Hz being the most common flavors for gaming panels. These monitors usually support AMD FreeSync (more common) or Nvidia G-Sync (less common and more expensive), as well. A subclass of G-Sync monitor, called G-Sync Compatible, doesn't have the full Nvidia G-Sync circuitry inside but is validated for solid variable refresh rate performance to deal with fluctuating frame rates smoothly. (Their appeal? They are generally cheaper than full G-Sync equivalents.)(Credit: Molly Flores)Because audio is a big part of the immersive gaming experience, if you don't have a desktop speaker set already, consider a display with a decent speaker system, though most in-monitor speakers are middling at best. Alternately, a jack mounted on the side or front of the cabinet for plugging in a gaming headset is practical if you tend to go the contained-sound route. A monitor with a USB hub to plug in several controllers is also desirable. (For much more, check out our guide to the best gaming monitors.)Should I Get a 4K Monitor?4K or UHD monitors aren't just for gamers. In fact, many prospective owners of 4K monitors are video editors or users who like to have multiple application windows open side by side without adding a second monitor. If that's you, you don't need to look for a panel with lightning-quick response times, but you should pay attention to color gamut, contrast ratios, and size.(Credit: Molly Flores)A 27-inch 4K monitor (starting around $300) will generally let you fit three full-size browser or program windows side by side. Any smaller than that, and the monitor won't be as useful for multitasking. Gamers, on the other hand, who are 4K-minded will want to look for a larger display compatible with fast response times and FreeSync or G-Sync if their PC uses a graphics card that supports one or the other, since a higher resolution makes screen tearing even more distracting. Gaming at 4K takes a very powerful video card, however. (See our guide to the best graphics cards for 4K gaming.) 4K gaming displays also start around $350, but they can range well north of $1,000 for 32-inch or larger models with GPU adaptive sync and IPS technology. Given the high prices and scarcity of 4K-appropriate gaming cards these days, 1080p or 1440p is a much more realistic gaming resolution for most folks.

The company's latest addition to its portfolio, the Anamorphic-XR (AR/VR), is promoting wider adoption of AR/VR by addressing some of the most notable issues in contemporary devices, such as their display brightness, field of view, and color fidelity.In an interview with DIGITIMES Asia, CEO Robert Ramsey and Head of Sales and Marketing Paul Treichler shared insights into Rain's journey from 3D cinema displays to consumer applications, including partnerships with major tech companies such as Lenovo for e-privacy solutions. The company is now in talks with industry leaders such as Magic Leap, Apple, and Meta to integrate its technologies into their AR/VR devices.Rain Technology's roots trace back to RealD, where the team developed display technologies for 3D cinema. In 2017, they spun off as RealD ME, focusing on consumer applications and advanced directional displays. The company rebranded as Rain Technology in 2021 and now operates globally with offices in Taiwan, Colorado, and the UK.Pioneering e-privacy through display technologyOne of the first consumer applications of Rain technology is its e-privacy solution, achieved through its displays. They developed a technology that goes inside the backlight system of LCDs capable of directing very small light beams precisely to a user's eye.In practice, it allows users to activate a privacy mode if they don't wish the content on their displays to be seen by bystanders. \\\"\\u2026 you drive it at a particular voltage, and it blocks all the higher angles and axis angles where people cannot see it, so only the head-on user can see it,\\\" said Ramsey. It can also turn back to a standard LCD once privacy mode is turned off, which Rain calls \\\"share mode\\\". This technology and its subsequent iterations were licensed to Lenovo and HP and utilized in their laptops.Entering the AR/VR marketThe transition to AR and VR was a natural progression for Rain Technology. Drawing from their experience in auto-stereoscopic 3D displays, which allows users to see 3D without glasses by controlling a light field display to toggle images to the user's left and right eyes, the team recognized that this technology can be utilized in AR/VR applications. \\\"We started noticing in the market that there were a couple of things that really bogged down the AR sector, such as brightness, color fidelity, and field of view,\\\" Ramsey noted.As consumers of AR/VR, both Ramsey and Treichler mentioned that their experience is often hindered by comfort and the content not being compelling enough. Ramsey believed that a major part of the issue was the display drop-off. \\\"Companies like Apple have made displays so good, and then you put on an AR headset and see this 8-bit dinosaur walking across you \\u2026 it's a step backward,\\\" he explained.Rain Technology has already spent several years working on a technology that could lend itself to AR/VR applications. After identifying the market, they went into development mode for about three and a half years and published their Anamorphic-XR technology about a year ago. Ramsey believes that their technology can help address current issues with AR/VR and even achieve the \\\"holy grail\\\" of the AR landscape, where a displayed image can be seamlessly placed into the real world.Technological Innovations for AR/VRThe advantages of Rain's Anamorphic-XR technology are twofold. On one hand, the imaging system doesn't magnify the image, which means there's no image distortion, and brightness is conserved. On the other hand, it doesn't compress the image due to the way the technology extracts the image, similarly avoiding distortion.They also mentioned that Anamorphic-XR fits particularly well with the same form factor of glasses, thus making it perfect for devices such as AR glasses. A standard pair of glasses has lens frames and side frames that go over the wearer's ears. Typically, a projector is tucked into the side frame to inject imagery into the lenses, by which the image is extracted to the user's eyes. However, because the image source is directed from a single point (the frame), it has to be expanded in both x and y dimensions, leading to distorted images.Rain's solution involves filling the entire top side of the frame with a display and injecting it down into the lenses. By doing so, the display only has to extend the imagery in one (downward) direction rather than downwards and sideways.While the major improvements in brightness and color aren't yet causing waves, the display impressively avoids the need to magnify light and alter the fundamental physics. Furthermore, the downward dimension is highly related to the field of view. By having a horizontal display across the entire frame, it is in a perfect position to offer users a much wider field of view compared to existing devices.Treichler highlighted that for consumers, the increased brightness and reduced need to refocus (since there's only one dimension to consider) will improve AR/VR comfort, enhance highlight visibility, and achieve a broader dynamic range, resulting in a better overall experience. On the manufacturing side, this solution \\\"doesn't use any exotic materials or processes,\\\" thus simplifying production.Future directionsBesides AR/VR, Rain Technology is also excited to explore several new sectors. In particular, Rain is developing its technology to work on micro LED and even nano LED displays, in line with its vision to add to the displays from major display manufacturers such as BOE and AUO.Treichler added that he is particularly excited about bringing their e-privacy solutions to OLED and consequently, smartphones. Smartphone privacy is currently achieved by adding a piece of glass or plastic on top of the display, even on $1,500 \\\"premium\\\" models. Moreover, once the piece is added on, the device is permanently stuck in privacy mode.Rain Technology's solution allows users to be able to freely switch between private or share mode, without having to stick an extra piece of material on their phone's display. Last but not least, automotive displays are also a field of interest, with applications such as preventing driver distractions.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated storiesNASA uses AR to improve spacecraft assembly efficiencyGiantplus starts production of flexible OTFTs, marking a breakthrough in the fieldThree reasons behind SDC and LGD's decision to slow down their Micro LED businessHow VR and AR technologies are transforming gaming experienceApple's Vision Pro delay casts doubt on OLEDoS futureTargeting AR device market, Samsung Display unveils LEDoS development processShow moreCategoriesDisplays + photonics Display system IT + CE IT components, peripherals Tags3D AR/VR display LCD technology \\n\\nShare this article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther links\\n\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBIZ FOCUSJul 15, 10:35How cryptocurrency technology can enhance financial servicesMonday 15 July 2024Crypto Quantique partners with silicon IP distributors across Asia to deliver quantum-driven chip securityThursday 11 July 2024TechInsights: Americas' chip suppliers continue to dominate R&D spendingFriday 28 June 2024Why should busy professionals use AI for their passport size photo editing?TOP STORIES7 DAYS NEWSChinese brands dominate smartphone and TV markets via dual circulation strategyTaiwan fab toolmakers grab major orders from TSMC and ChinaIndian startup and semiconductor titans team up to bridge skill gapMediaTek to surpass Qualcomm Snapdragon in 5G smartphone marketAI server shipments to surge in 2H24 as GPU shortage easesSamsung latest LPDDR5 DRAM validated for use with Dimensity 9400China's counter-intuitive semiconductor exports surge goes unnoticedHuawei reveals operational hardship from US sanctions, expresses confidence in recoveryNvidia plans new China-specific AI and gaming GPUsTSMC joins HBM4 arena with 5nm base chip production for memory giantsFull list\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin our mailing list\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDIGITIMES\\n\\nAbout\\nAdvertising\\nMembership\\nTerms & conditions\\nPrivacy policy\\nCopyright policy\\nContact us\\nNotes & corrections\\nSite map\\n\\u4e2d\\u6587\\u7db2\\u7e41\\u9ad4\\n\\u4e2d\\u6587\\u7f51\\u7b80\\u4f53\\n\\n\\n\\nTOOLS & SERVICES\\n\\nTomorrow's Headlines\\n7 days news\\nWeb news elsewhere\\nTopics\\nRSS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a9\\u00a02024 DIGITIMES Inc.

It\\u2019s moving into a third-floor, 10,700 square-foot space at Lincoln Square South as part of the Bellevue Collection development.\\n\\u201cOur venue takes the party game concept to new heights,\\u201d Mirra founder Sam Wang said in a press release. \\u201cWe\\u2019re merging VR technology with a vibrant social scene to create unforgettable events.\\u201d\\nWang founded Mirra in 2020 in Bellevue. His previous positions include a stint as a general manager at the visual effects studio Phenom Films and co-founding the VR startup Skylimit Entertainment Group, both located in Beijing.\\nAt Mirra, attendees can play multiple VR games that the company has developed in-house, with a focus on party games for a variety of skill levels. The games are intended for adults, but can be played by families with children.\\nAn individual player at Mirra uses a VR headset to participate in any given game. As they play, their actions are broadcast via a holographic avatar to a nearby giant 8K LED screen wall.\\nThe idea is that each game is immersive for its participants, while also being fun to watch on the big screen for attendees who are still in actual reality. Mirra\\u2019s launch lineup includes dancing, treasure hunts, hockey, and a variety of other activities presented in a game show format.\\nIn addition to its VR games, Mirra features a full kitchen and bar, interactive technologies for attendees, and 8K LED screens throughout the venue that display multiple different environments.\\nThe current plan is that Mirra will be an all-ages venue until 6 p.m. After that, it shifts to become a 21-and-over nightclub until it closes at midnight.\\nGeekWire has reached out to Mirra to get more details about the venue, and we\\u2019ll update when we hear back.\\n\\n\\nThomas Wilde has been working as a journalist and editor in the gaming press since 2002, most notoriously as the editor for DoubleJump Books.

It\\u2019s very well refined for a first device, owing to the company\\u2019s close partnership with Vrgineers, the Czech hardware manufacturer behind a series of high-resolution, high FOV enterprise XR headsets.\\nImage courtesy Somnium Space\\nProviding premium features whilst being manufactured in Europe and boasting intensive QA testing though comes with a steep price point over its main competitors, Pimax Cystal ($1,600 USD) and the new Crystal Light ($900 USD), making price the biggest sticking point overall. Somnium\\u2019s cheapest \\u2018Classic Edition\\u2019 comes in at \\u20ac1,900 (~$2,060 USD),\\u00a0which only includes VR and not passthrough mixed reality, eye-tracking or hand-tracking. Spring for the Ultimate Edition, which is the focus of the hands-on, and you\\u2019re looking at somewhere north of \\u20ac3,500 (~$3,820 USD).\\u00a0This notably doesn\\u2019t include shipping or local taxes, or the required SteamVR base stations or optional controllers.\\nMy accumulative 30 minutes across three simulator-focused demos suggest VR1 definitely delivers the bulk of what\\u2019s promised, albeit with a few caveats (and features) that will probably push many towards the lower-priced alternative\\u2026 but not everyone. Read more to find out why.\\nOptics & Display\\nVR optics always require a balancing act. Do you trade weight for clarity? A slim profile for better light transmission? Conventional lenses for a wider FOV? Many of these trade-offs are on display with VR1\\u2019s dual-element aspheric lenses, which have a lot going for them, but a few notable drawbacks.\\nVR1\\u2019s lenses provide remarkable clarity and excellent light transmission, notably featuring a very large \\u2018sweet spot\\u2019 in the process, which is the optimal\\u00a0area within which the viewer\\u2019s eyes can move while maintaining a clear and consistent view. VR1 also accommodates a wide range of interpupillary distances (IPDs) of\\u00a058 mm \\u2013 76 mm thanks to manual IPD adjustment.\\nSuch a large FOV requires significant attention to distortion-correction\\u2014a battle that isn\\u2019t entirely won just yet.\\u00a0During my demo, I noticed some wobbliness in the optic\\u2019s periphery, although it\\u2019s definitely on the acceptable end of the spectrum since it didn\\u2019t cause me any discomfort. Chromatic aberration was thankfully a non-issue, the result of the production version\\u2019s latest update.\\nThe headlining feature undoubtedly though is its large FOV\\u2014130\\u00b0 horizontal and 105\\u00b0 vertical\\u2014which was perfect for the fully-kitted flight simulator I played, which is basically the only thing missing in my life right now. Coupled with the display\\u2019s brightness (more on that below), the large FOV is something I hope\\u00a0all headsets, standalone included, should aim to achieve one day.\\nImage captured by Tyriel Wood\\nOkay, I also want the driving simulator I saw there too, but the flight sim really shows of the full-fat experience of what VR1 has to offer, showcasing its mixed reality passthrough masked perfectly so I could see the flight stick and instrument cluster while having the virtual world of DCS\\u00a0whizzing past me. This is done through dual 12MP 4,056\\u00a0\\u00d7 3,040 RGB passthrough cameras that worked very well in the flight simulator, which notably was illuminated with an overhead light to offset the demo area\\u2019s dark, moody lighting.\\nSomnium Connect was technically a public event open to anyone who bought a ticket.\\u00a0A few of the people I spoke to while waiting in line were local and looking to try out the headset for fun, while some hardcore simmers were looking for conclusive proof that it was worth buying. While some likely walked away with a clear decision either way, VR1 is also targeting companies like flight schools, which spend significantly more on motion platforms and real-world flight expenses related to maintenance and gads of costly fuel. Because PC VR lacks mixed reality content, it\\u2019s probably only going to be used for these sorts of passthrough cases, which is easily togglable by hitting a button on the top of the device.\\nWhile I didn\\u2019t get to see the full field of view of the passthrough, it seems it\\u2019s calibrated to make objects appear only slightly farther away than they really were, however distortion of near-field objects was minimal, and sharp enough to see individual text on the instrument cluster. I imagine it will be good enough for more simple tasks like looking at your phone, or enabling passthrough for when someone needs your attention.\\nImage captured by Road to VR\\nAnother clear win is VR1\\u2019s display, which is very bright\\u2014a reported 210 nits and the highest I\\u2019ve seen in a production headset. It\\u2019s also notably the exact same QLED mini-LED fast LCD with local dimming you\\u2019ll find in Pimax Crystal and Pimax Crystal Light, providing 35PPD via its dual 8.3MP (2,880 \\u00d7 2,880) per-eye displays, clocked at 90Hz, but with 120Hz and 144Hz modes planned to arrive at some point. Here, the screen door effect feels essentially non-existent.\\nI\\u2019m not particularly sensitive to mura, however I noticed no appreciable irregularities or non-uniformities in the brightness or color of the display. Some of this, I was told, is owed to the company\\u2019s rigorous quality assurance (QA), which seems to be one of the headset\\u2019s biggest selling points. Somnium invested in what is surely a very expensive display inspection system which can detect dead pixels, mura, and other defects, leading to what company CEO Artur Sychov called a regrettable pile of trashed displays that didn\\u2019t make the grade.\\nSEE ALSOOfficial Vision Pro Schematics Will Accelerate Development of Headstraps & Third-party Accessories\\nAudio & Material Quality\\nAt this price, you\\u2019d expect built-in audio, but that\\u2019s simply not the case here, as you\\u2019ll need to either jack into a 3.5mm headphone port on either side, or go the wireless route with a USB-C dongle, like you might find on the Razer\\u00a0Hammerhead HyperSpeed earbuds.\\nMaybe no audio is better than bad\\u00a0audio, but it still feels like you\\u00a0should\\u00a0get something on par with Valve Index\\u2019s off-ear speakers for the price. Like with all hard straps, using your favorite cans may be problematic since the hinge sits so close to your ear.\\nImage courtesy Somnium Space\\nAnother thing you\\u2019d expect is exceptional build quality, which is thankfully mostly here. I suspect a thinner plastic was used in effort to lighten the overall weight of the headset, lending it a creaky feeling when specifically squeezed.\\nThis is likely due to the company offering eight different variants based on the same platform that mix and match faceplates integrating UltraLeap hand-tracking (which I didn\\u2019t try, but is recognized as class-leading) and passthrough cameras. It\\u2019s possible a tighter fit where the faceplate meets the shell of the headset would have solved this, or possibly more robust (and heavy) plastic\\u2014but it\\u2019s far from cheap-feeling or delicate.\\nErgonomics\\nSomnium VR1 is decidedly front-heavy, but not nearly as bulky as some photos may suggest. I didn\\u2019t get a chance to try the barebones Classic Edition without all of the bells and whistles to compare, however much of the platform\\u2019s front-heaviness is undoubtedly owed to its optical stack; the Classic Edition (with headstrap) comes in only 100 g lighter than its Ultimate Edition big brother.\\nImage courtesy Somnium Space\\nMy accumulative 30 minutes in the headset wasn\\u2019t particularly telling of long-term comfort for the average user, but knowing my limits, I can imagine an hour is around the most I can do before needing a break. I don\\u2019t hold it against the headstrap either, which places the hinge farther from the temple and closer to your ear allowing for a good fit that cups the back of your head.\\nAdditionally\\u2014and this may seem fairly obvious\\u2014but because of the added bulk, you\\u2019ll\\u00a0 need to crank it down so the inertia of moving your head doesn\\u2019t noticeably shift the displays around, which can cause added discomfort. At first, I thought there was tracking and/or rendering latency in the flight simulator simply because I didn\\u2019t properly clamp it to my head.\\nThat said, my daily driver is Meta Quest 3 with the optional Battery Strap (don\\u2019t @ me, bro), so moving back to an 850 g PC VR headset tethered with not one, but two cables felt like a bit like stepping back in time to the days of the original HTC Vive.\\n\\u2013 \\u2013 \\u2014 \\u2013 \\u2013\\nBy now, it\\u2019s pretty clear: Somnium VR1 is basically only for users who are already in the SteamVR tracking ecosystem, or don\\u2019t mind shelling out the thousands for all of the required kit. That includes SteamVR 2.0 base stations direct from Valve or HTC, various controllers, and a PC capable of running these high-resolution displays.\\nThe flight sim rig in particular was sporting a RTX 4070Ti and some\\u00a0flavor of Intel Core i7, however it was making use of foveated rendering thanks to the Ultimate Edition\\u2019s eye-tracking, meaning only businesses and the most enthused of enthusiasts with enough PC horsepower should apply.\\nBeing based in Europe is a blessing and a curse. Startup money there is more sparse, as Lynx CEO Stan Larroque recently attested, leaving few with the resources to produce quality devices at competitive prices. And Somnium VR1 is a solid offering, but I\\u2019m afraid it\\u2019s simply too expensive for the average Valve Index user to consider a \\u2018no-brainer\\u2019 upgrade relative to Pimax\\u2019s upcoming Crystal Light headset, which is notably less half the price of the base Classic Edition.\\n\\nDisclosure: Somnium Space covered travel and lodging expenses for one Road to VR writer to attend Somnium Connect 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\u00a0Thank you for Signing Up\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlease correct the marked field(s) below.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1,true,6,Contact Email,2\\n\\n\\n\\nRoad to VR - Daily Roundup\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis article may contain affiliate links.

He has been professionally reporting on the space for nearly a decade as Editor at Road to VR, authoring more than 4,000 articles on the topic. Scott brings that seasoned insight to his reporting from major industry events across the globe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nViRGiN\\n\\n\\n\\nI already said sponsorship is coming from somnium.\\nstopped reading at \\\"got a chance to go hands-on at the company\\u2019s Somnium Connect event held in Prague\\\". No, you didn't get a chance, you got paid to do so, just like tons of other shill people in vr space.\\nyou do say that at the bottom of article, but as per rule of thumb, you don't even say that somnium space which you claim they are best known for has been completly dead for years.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBen Lang\\n\\n\\n\\nWe make these disclosures voluntarily because we think transparency is important\\u2014not everyone does the same. So while you may see it as us being a \\\"shills,\\\" we're very happy that 99.9% of our articles don't need disclosures like this, because we actively avoid conflicts of interest as often as possible.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nViRGiN\\n\\n\\n\\nNot mentioning how dead their metaverse is strains a bit from being \\u201ctransparent\\u201d. Like, how can you mention this is what they are known for, without mentioning how irrelevant somnium space has been since inception.\\nI saw the event on a different YouTube channel, and Arthur still comes off as crypto scammer.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBen Lang\\n\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately any single article or headline can never be 100% comprehensive. Stay tuned for more coverage.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nViRGiN\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\u2019ve been pointing it out multiple times, I think under every mention of \\u201cSomnium VR1\\u201d this year.\\nNoone ever wants to say that, because this is business opportunity. If not outright website advertisment, then at least you get to travel for free. \\nIf you were to say Somnium Space has been averaging 0.5 people the last 36 months, that would be seen negatively by Arthur, and you would never be invited again.\\nJust like YouTuber and tech analyst Brad \\u201cSadlyItsBradley\\u201d Lynch, who only nodded to everything Arthur was telling him, never questioning him about anything. Since he got his AVP, that was 100% of his focus, and he didn\\u2019t even get invited again, when it was promised he will get to test updated headsets as they come closer to production lmao.\\n\\u201cNever attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by neglect\\u201d, but in this case, it\\u2019s 100% malice, not neglect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArno van Wingerde\\n\\n\\n\\nCome on, ViRGiN! Since these things are not sold yet, the only other way ben could have gotten hold of one would be breaking and entering. Also, buying a fairly niche product for the sake of reviewing that is pushing things a bit and as Ben wrote he fully disclosed his visit.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nViRGiN\\n\\n\\n\\nThere is no need to purchase it, cause there is nothing significant about it, and naturally it doesn\\u2019t have place in the market, like the pimax headsets which struggled to capture 1% of steamvr market. \\nAs you might have noticed, the event was open to public. Buying a plane ticket and hotel for a night or two sounds doable don\\u2019t you think? In controlled environment there is not much to test, but only pressure to say \\u201cyes it looks clear\\u201d. \\nIf we have to rely on sponsorships, then what\\u2019s the point of journalism? Independence is gone at that moment, and so is trust. \\nArthur is a very shady character.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTonyVT SkarredGhost\\n\\n\\n\\nNice review, Scott!

To help guide you to the right VR experience for you, we've gathered our top picks below based on our own hands-on testing and reviews. Seeing as Prime Day 2024 deals are in full swing, now may be the perfect time to buy. These are the Best VR Headsets for 2024:Meta Quest 3 - Best OverallMeta Quest 2 - Best Budget OptionApple Vision Pro - Best Augmented RealityPlayStation VR2 - Best for PS5HTC Vive XR Elite - Best Wireless OptionValve Index - Best High-End OptionHTC Vive Pro 2 - Best ResolutionThe best VR headsets offer advanced tracking, six degrees of freedom (6DoF), and high resolutions. Apple has even thrown its hat in the ring with the Vision Pro, an astronomically priced, innovative option. To help you navigate the complicated market, we've found seven solid options available now \\u2013 and click here to find them in the UK.1. Meta Quest 3Best VR HeadsetMeta Quest 37Outstanding standalone VR headset running on a powerful Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip that is comfortable on head with excellent optical performance and well-tracked controllers. See it at AmazonSee it on TargetPlatform: Standalone, PC | Resolution (per-eye): 2,064 x 2,208 | Refresh rate: 120Hz | Field of view: 110-degrees | Tracking: 6DoF | Weight: 1.13 poundsPros: Crisp, smooth visuals from the dual 2,064 x 2,208, 120Hz LCDsFull-color pass-through mode for mixed-reality gaming Cons:Significantly more expensive than the Meta Quest 2 at launch The Meta Quest 3 has everything you need in an entry-level. Starting at $499, it got a big price hike from its predecessor, but with all the impressive upgrades, the cost is justified. This headset is slimmer with better ergonomics than the Quest 2, making it more comfortable to wear. Dual 2,064 x 2,208 LCDs with a 120Hz refresh rate ensure crisp, smooth visuals, while pancake lenses, a wider 110-degree field of view, and other optical improvements make for a better viewing experience. The VR headset is paired with lightweight, well-tracked controllers. What makes the Quest a standout from other VR headsets is it\\u2019s a standalone device that doesn\\u2019t require a PC or console to run\\u2014you can always grab the link cable if you\\u2019re looking to play PC VR offerings. Meta has a massive library of immersive VR games, but at the moment, there aren\\u2019t many that showcase the true potential of this headset\\u2019s wildly capable Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip. This headset even has a sharp, full-color passthrough mode for those looking to get into mixed-reality gaming.  The Meta Quest 2's lenses2. Meta Quest 2Best Budget VR Headset Meta Quest 2 - 128GB163An excellent standalone VR headset offering crisp visuals and large controllers with haptic feedback that runs without cables. See it at AmazonSee it on Best BuySee it on TargetPlatform: Standalone, PC | Resolution (per-eye): 1,832 x 1,920 | Refresh Rate: 90-120Hz | Field of View: 89-degrees | Tracking: 6DoF | Weight: 1.1 poundsPros: Standalone deviceBudget-friendly and great for beginners Cons:Controllers too large for some handsIf you like the sound of the Meta Quest 3 but want to save a few bucks, the $250 Meta Quest 2 is the way to go. You still get a robust library of immersive VR games, streaming apps, and educational content to learn in an enrapturing, fresh format. It does all of this as a standalone device that doesn't require a phone or PC, though similar to the Quest 3, you can connect it with a link cable and open up a world of PC VR experiences.The Meta Quest 2 offers crisp visuals and minimal screen door effect while warding off motion sickness thanks to its high resolution and 90-120Hz refresh rate. Since it runs without cables, you can use it anywhere, and its built-in camera warns you when you\\u2019re getting close to any obstacles in your environment. The controllers have decent haptic feedback with extra thumb space\\u2014only people with smaller hands may find them harder to hold. Sure, everything on the Meta Quest 3 is a little bit better, but the Quest 2 is hands down the best budget VR headset and perfect for those just beginning to test the waters of VR. The innovative Apple Vision Pro3. Apple Vision ProBest Augmented Reality HeadsetApple Vision Pro1Revolutionary \\u201cspatial computing\\u201d headset with stunning displays, gesture control, and immersive experiences for work and play. See it at ApplePlatform: Standalone, Apple | Resolution (per-eye): 4K | Refresh Rate: 90, 96, 100Hz | Field of View: 120-degrees | Tracking: 6DoF | Weight: 1.4 poundsPros: Innovative performance and hand/eye tracking Impressive 4K displays with pass-through Cons:Lackluster battery and uncomfortable designThe Apple Vision Pro lets us glimpse into what the future of \\u201cspatial computing\\u201d can be, and it\\u2019s pretty wild. It delivers a sort of augmented reality, thanks to the stunning almost 4K displays that use 12 cameras to track the world around you and put it right into your eyes. Interacting with the headset involves mostly gestures using not only your fingers but your eyes; it\\u2019s not always consistent though still something to marvel at.  Now, the Apple Vision Pro doesn\\u2019t offer VR games at the moment, but there are a few Apple Arcade games designed for the Vision Pro that use augmented reality, interacting with the space around you. If you\\u2019re looking to watch movies or take advantage of Apple TV\\u2019s immersive video, be prepared for wildly realistic, reality-bending experiences. When you want to work, you can place your MacBook screen on the Vision Pro, as well as messages and other windows all about the space around you for easy access. Admittedly, this headset isn\\u2019t perfect, from its exorbitant price tag to the less-than-comfortable design and lackluster battery. But the Apple Vision Pro demonstrates the exciting possibilities of how we will be interacting with this technology down the road. Headset and sense controllers of the PlayStation VR24. PlayStation VR2Best VR Headset for PS5PlayStation VR230Built-in tracking cameras, eye tracking, 4K OLED panels, and two tactile Sense controllers with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback come with this VR headset designed for the PS5. See it at PlayStationSee it on AmazonSee it on TargetPlatform: PS5 | Resolution (per-eye): 2,000 x 2,040 | Refresh rate: 120Hz | Field of view: 110-degrees | Tracking: 6DoF | Weight: 1.24 poundsPros: 4K OLED displays with HDR and a 120Hz refresh rate Tactile Sense controllers and eye trackingCons:Can\\u2019t play PC VR or original PSVR gamesConsole gamers rejoice as the PlayStation VR2 is here, and it\\u2019s great and ready to take your PS5 gaming experience to the next level. Coming in at $550, this VR headset costs more than the console itself, but all the features on offer, from the built-in tracking cameras and eye tracking to the two tactile Sense controllers with adaptive triggers and haptic feedback, make it worth the splurge. And unlike the original, the setup is simple, as you just plug in a single USB-C, do a bit of calibration, and you\\u2019re ready to go. After you\\u2019ve got everything configured and the PlayStation VR2 resting comfortably on your head, you\\u2019ll enjoy 4K OLED panels offering HDR, a 120Hz refresh rate, and 110-degree FOV for some super smooth, gorgeous images to keep you immersed in the action. You\\u2019re truly getting PC-level VR in a headset with more features and better specs than many pricier PC VR headsets, like the Valve Index and HP Reverb G2. However, you, unfortunately, can\\u2019t play any of the expansive library of PC VR games or even a majority of the original PSVR games on this new headset, so you\\u2019re limited in what you can play currently.See more PS5 headsets.5. HTC Vive XR EliteBest Wireless PC VRHTC Vive XR Elite9Play PC VR games wirelessly via a WiFi 6/6E connection or wired using a USB-C on this headset with full motion tracking, a depth sensor, and two motion controllers.See it at VivePlatform: Standalone, PC | Resolution (per-eye): 1,920 x 1,920 | Refresh rate: 90Hz | Field of view: 110-degrees | Tracking: 6DoFPros: Can play wirelessly via a WiFi 6/6E connectionFull motion tracking and two motion controllersCons:Expensive for a similar performance to the Meta Quest 2 HTC was arguably the first to create a true standout VR headset, and their latest venture brings a standalone VR experience, similar to the Meta Quest 3, along with PC VR into one headset, the Vive XR Elite. If you want to play some of your PC VR games, this headset lets you do so wirelessly via a WiFi 6/6E connection. You can also hook it up directly to your gaming PC via USB-C, which means you can lose the swappable battery pack on the back of the device, making the headset lighter with more of a glasses-type vibe. The Vive XR Elite operates at a smooth 90Hz, and with a 1,920 x 1,920 pixels per eye resolution, it almost eliminates any screen door effect. Headphones on the headset deliver spatial audio for greater immersion in the action. Of course, you also get full motion tracking with four cameras and a depth sensor, and it comes with two motion controllers. However, the high cost is somewhat hard to justify, given many of its feature match the Meta Quest 2, which is less than half the price. 6. Valve IndexBest High-End VR HeadsetValve Index38A smooth 120Hz refresh rate, 1,440 x 1,600 per-eye resolution, expanded base stations for larger map areas to play, and controllers with full finger tracking make this high-end headset worth the splurge.See it at SteamSee it on AmazonPlatform: PC | Resolution (per-eye): 1,440 \\u00d7 1,600 | Refresh rate: 120Hz (144Hz experimental mode) | Field of view: 130-degrees | Tracking: 6DoF | Weight: 1.79 poundsPros: Controllers have full finger trackingComfortableCons:Requires base stationsHopefully you scored a solid gaming PC deal, so you can splurge on one of the best VR headsets for PC. The Valve Index has 1,440 x 1,600 per-eye resolution at a buttery smooth 120Hz. Expanded base stations enable you to map larger areas to play in, and the controllers have full finger tracking. All that great functionality puts it ahead of the competition, but it\\u2019s also lot more expensive. Although you can mitigate some of that cost by using original Vive parts. Do this and you\\u2019ll be able to customize your setup, based on what you value most, or buy the full Valve Index to have the best visual VR experience available. It's perfect for titles like Half-Life: Alyx. Unfortunately, the Steam Deck is not currently optimized for VR experiences, so you won't be able to use it very effectively with the Valve Index.7. HTC Vive Pro 2Best High-Resolution VR HeadsetHTC Vive Pro 222With a resolution of 2,448 x 2,448 per eye, you\\u2019ll forget about the screen door effect, while a 120-degree FOV and a buttery 120fps ensure an enjoyable viewing experience. See it at AmazonPlatform: PC | Resolution (per-eye): 2,448 \\u00d7 2,448 | Refresh rate: 120Hz | Field of view: 120-degrees | Tracking: 6DoF | Weight: 1.9 poundsPros: Sharp 2,448 x 2,448 resolution per eye with 120\\u00b0 FOVImmersive audio Cons:Requires a powerful PC to runIf \\u2018resolution\\u2019 is your buzzword of choice, the Vive Pro 2 is the one for you. With a resolution of 2,448 x 2,448 per eye, the HTC Vive Pro 2 will let you forget all about the screen-door effect, but you\\u2019ll need a powerful PC to run it.It also has a 120-degree FOV and runs at 120Hz, meaning not only will your VR experiences LOOK good, but they\\u2019ll feel really good, too. The included Hi-Res Certified headphones mount to the headset to give you immersive audio, too.Adjustable HP Reverb G2 headset with built-in headphonesWhere to Get the Best VR Headset in the UKBest VR Headset Meta Quest 23\\u00a3399.00 at AmazonHow to Choose a VR Headset, According to Our ExpertsOur above list is comprised of all of our favorite headsets, but this isn\\u2019t an exhaustive list, and more headsets are coming. To determine which VR headset is right for you, keep these key things in mind:PlatformThe best VR headset is the one you can (and will) actually use. If you already have a beefy gaming PC, or are willing to spend serious cash to buy or build one, and you have space in a room large enough for room-scale VR, grab a SteamVR headset, which will give you the best experience, overall.If you want the ability to play on a standalone system without a PC or you want a flexible setup where that is an option \\u2013 get the Meta Quest 3.GamesIf there are any exclusive games you want to play, that is another huge factor. Buying the excellent PSVR2 will get you access to a bunch of great exclusive PSVR2 games, but that doesn\\u2019t do you any good if you want to play Half-Life: Alyx. Moreover, buying into the PSVR2 means you will be dependant on Sony to release more games and support it, while the PC-centric nature of the other platforms gives you more flexibility in how the headsets can be used.SteamVR works on basically all of the PC-based headsets, which is great. Meta also has some exclusives, and although they may be playable on SteamVR devices with Revive, there is no guarantee. The Apple Vision Pro doesn't even offer VR gaming at the moment, while only a select few Apple Arcade games let you take advatage of augmented reality on the headset. Resolution & Refresh RatePerformance is always incredibly important in gaming, but this can actually impact your health, too. While low resolutions can result in the \\u201cscreen door effect,\\u201d which makes things look worse, poor frame rates and resolution can also cause eye strain and even motion sickness. While these normally occur at refresh rates lower than 90Hz, your mileage may vary. Stationary vs Room-ScaleThe most immersive VR experience is the room-scale one. Being able to move about freely (called \\u201csix-degrees of freedom\\u201d), jump, crouch, and move around lets you truly experience the wonder of VR. Realistically, not everyone has room, or the ability, to participate in that.If you have limited mobility, or don\\u2019t have room in your home, options that only track head movement instead of body movement is the way to go. This is perfectly suited towards watching movies, and similar activities.Tracking SystemMuch like the difference between Station VS Room-Scale, the tracking system is also really important and it will influence how your headset feels to use. The Meta Quest 3 and more use inside-out tracking, which means the headset tracks your movement using cameras and sensors built into the headset. This means you don\\u2019t have to set up external cameras around your room, but it also means it\\u2019s less accurate.If you are operating in a smaller space, or are a more casual user, inside-out tracking might be for you. If you want the best experience and have access to extra room, pick a headset with external tracking.Wired vs WirelessThis originally wasn\\u2019t a choice at all. The first VR headsets had cables, but lately more and more wireless options are becoming available. Like many of the other choices on this list, this basically comes down to \\u201cfreedom\\u201d vs \\u201cperformance.\\u201d While wireless sets mean you won\\u2019t trip over a cable, and you can wander more freely in a larger space, wires aren\\u2019t that obtrusive once you get used to them, and they will give your headset higher bandwidth, which generally means the best resolution and image quality. Having a wire also means you don\\u2019t have to worry about headset batteries running out.If that is important to you, picked a wired set, although there are several very high quality sets that can be used both wired and wirelessly, which is a great way to go if you aren\\u2019t sure what you want.VR has tons of promise, and not just in the gaming space. As the years go on, you may be able to attend concerts for all of your favorite bands, visit other planets in our solar system, and more, all from the comfort of your own home. Follow our guidelines, and we hope you\\u2019ll discover a whole new frontier of entertainment, education, and more.VR Headset FAQWhat's the Difference Between VR and AR?Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) are terms often thrown around in the gaming world but have some distinct differences. AR is a much more accessible technology, as almost anyone with a smartphone can use it. With AR, you get virtual features in the real world, often through your phone or headset\\u2019s camera. One of the best examples of an AR game is Pokemon Go, where you use your phone's camera to navigate through the real world, and virtual elements, such as Pokemon or PokeStops, appear. You can even interact with these elements through your device. But, of course, they are not actually physically in front of you. Augmented reality is just adding to your current surroundings. Apple's Vision Pro uses AR in extremely fun and innovative way. VR uses some aspects of AR but takes things to another level by eliminating the real-world setting. Instead, your entire world is computer generated, so it doesn\\u2019t matter where you\\u2019re actually physically located. All of your surroundings are replaced, and what you see is controlled by a computer system. Therefore, headsets block out the real world, blindfolding you for a fully immersive experience. Some great VR game examples are Half-Life: Alyx, which places you in a dystopian sci-fi universe, or the PSVR 2 version of Gran Turismo 7, where you\\u2019ll be residing in the cockpit of a car. What's a Good Meta Quest 3 Alternative?The Meta Quest 3 appears to be in a league of its own with its standalone functionality, impressive motion tracking, and budget-friendly price. That means finding a suitable alternative is a challenge. Of course, you could go with the Meta\\u2019s Quest Pro, but it\\u2019s pricey and not even meant to play games. The  HTC Vive XR Elite offers similar specs to the Quest 3 and even lets you play PC VR games wirelessly over a WiFi 6/6E. However, the astronomical $1,000 price is hard to justify when you get very few extras and can snag the Quest 3 for $500.  That leads us to our best Meta Quest 3 alternative: the Pico 4. The Pico 4 and Quest 2 have a lot in common, as they\\u2019re both standalone wireless headsets, run on a similar processor, and support PC VR. A longer battery life, lighter design, more clarity, and a wider field of view even give the Pico 4 a slight edge over the Quest 3. But as great as the Pico 4 sounds, it has limited availability in the US, sometimes making the reasonably priced headset more expensive stateside. If you decide to grab the Pico 4, be sure to do research and shop around before purchasing. What VR Doesn't Need a PC?The majority of VR requires a PC to function, which can be difficult if you don\\u2019t have a powerful computer ready to run these often graphically intensive games or want freedom in where you play. Luckily, there are a few standalone VR headsets and options that run on other devices. You can use Meta Quest 3 and the whole lineup of Meta headsets without being connected to a PC thanks to powerful processors. But if you\\u2019re looking to play some PC VR offerings, you can always link Meta Quest to your PC. The Pico 4 is another great standalone option similar to the Quest 3. The HTC XR Elite is also ready to run VR apps and games sans a connection. Those with a PlayStation 5 can grab PlayStation VR2 for a truly spectacular VR experience, though you can\\u2019t use the headset with PCs. There are also a few smartphone VR options, like the Atlasonix VR Headset, but don\\u2019t expect too much from these budget VR headsets that use your phone\\u2019s screen. Of course, Apple's Vision Pro is an extremely powerful standalone device. But it'll easy integrate into the Apple Ecosystem and connect to MacBooks for an innovative way to work on your devices. Does the Nintendo Switch have VR?Yes, the Nintendo Switch has VR and a handful of VR games, but it's relatively simple and lackluster compared to what the VR headsets are capable of on this guide. For the Switch, you\\u2019ll usually rely on the device's own screen and slot it into a headset. One of the most popular options is the Nintendo Labo VR Kit, which features fun-shaped cardboard designs that you create yourself. Otherwise, you\\u2019ll find slightly more robust options with straps. There is a convoluted process to using the Switch with a more high-tech VR headset. However, it\\u2019s quite complicated and requires additional hardware. So, if you\\u2019re looking for a more immersive experience when playing the gaming handheld, you\\u2019re better off grabbing one of the best Nintendo Switch headsets than seeking out VR. What\\u2019s Happening to Windows Mixed Reality? Microsoft has announced it will be forgoing support of Windows Mixed Reality, its virtual and augmented reality platform, in a future Windows software release expected in late 2024. This will include both the Portal app and SteamVR driver, which are necessary for the Windows Mixed Reality headsets to function. The VR headsets should continue to work with Steam until late 2026. After that, there will be no updates or technical support.When Do VR Headsets Go on Sale?Although some of the best VR headsets never actually get discounted, there are generally a few times a year when you can find discounts on popular models. One of the overall best shopping events for VR discounts is Amazon Prime Day, which takes place in July every year. After that, Black Friday and Cyber Monday tend to have the best overall deals consistently. Both events tend to primarily offer Meta Quest deals, but sometimes other headsets are avaialable at a discount.Brian Barnett writes reviews, wiki guides, deals posts, features, and more for IGN.

For Amazon Prime Day the company is offering 30% off the glasses and discounts on key accessories:\\u00a0Viture One Glasses: $299 (more than 30% off)Viture One Dock Pack: $379 (more than 30% off)Viture One Duo Pack: $689 (more than 30% off)Viture Mobile Dock: $89 (more than 30% off)Viture One Cloud Pack: $499 (nearly 20% off)Viture One iPhone 15 Pack, $380 (more than 20% off)Viture One Lightning iPhone Pack, $388 (more than 20% off)Also:\\u00a0The best Prime Day deals: Live updatesAlthough I've tried multiple VR devices in the past (Google's Daydream and Samsung's phone-based VR products) I hadn't been fully convinced of the usefulness of VR for my own purposes. It wasn't until I saw the reviews of the Apple Vision Pro that I decided to further explore the AR/VR/XR options that could optimize my work and play environments. It took testing three different products and a handful of software updates until I was finally convinced that there is indeed a product that could improve my productivity while also helping me enjoy some down time.My work commute includes almost 45 minutes of train riding each way with limited tablespace to get work done. I also travel at least once monthly for work with a laptop as my primary computer. Work in my home and business offices is optimized by two external displays, so commuting with just a single small laptop display is a challenge for me to work on.Review:\\u00a0Apple Vision Pro: Fascinating, flawed, and needs to fix 5 thingsI also like to watch movies and YouTube videos while traveling, something I have done (like most people) for decades on my mobile devices.  But today there are better options out there that simulate the big screen experience, so I figured it was time to try out some new technology. Unfortunately, it wasn't to be. Why I returned the Apple Vision ProI previously detailed my productivity experiences with the Apple Vision Pro before ultimately returning the headset to Apple. I would have kept it to test future software updates, but I value my marriage of more than 30 years and wasn't willing to lose my spouse for $4,300. The major productivity concern was the limit of one MacOS display shown virtually. For someone used to working with multiple screens, this was unfortunately a dealbreaker.  For now, at least.\\u00a0      Matthew Miller/ZDNETWhy I returned the Meta Quest 3Even though ZDNET awarded the Meta Quest 3 its  best product of 2023 award, up to this point I hadn't tried it. But  after learning that the Quest 3 supported multiple virtual desktop  displays, I went ahead and ordered a Quest 3 in an attempt to expand my  laptop work experience.Frankly, I was blown away by the Meta  Quest 3 and couldn't believe how close of an experience it was to  Apple's Vision Pro, despite the Vision Pro being seven times more  expensive. Gaming is clearly a focus of the Quest 3 and in this area it  far exceeds what Apple is currently offering, but ultimately, that  wasn't why I wanted to try it out.What I really wanted to see was how it handled the workplace. So, I  installed Immersed, Remote Desktop, and Meta Horizons Workroom on the  headset and on my MacBook Pro. Immersed and Meta Horizons Workroom both  provide three, or more, virtual displays via a wireless connection to  the headset and I was banking on this working well for my commuting and  business travel.However, just as I was confident that the Meta  Quest 3 was the headset for me,  the folks at Viture dropped SpaceWalker  for MacOS. I tried this out for an hour and was so impressed, I had to  fill out the return for for the Quest 3. Who knows, I may still keep it  around for home use since it still is fun to enter the VR space and  escape from reality from time-to-time.     Matthew Miller/ZDNETWhy I'm sticking with the Viture One XR glassesXR glasses are designed to provide you with a large virtual display, but in a lightweight sunglasses form factor. I first tried the XReal Air 2 Pro, but returned them after a few days because the visual clarity was disappointing, and I didn't find the Nebula software useful at all as it provided limited apps in a flashy VR form.\\u00a0With a 15-hour flight from LA to Brisbane coming up, however, I ordered the new Viture One XR glasses and Mobile Dock accessory and decided to give them a try. These are similar to the XReal Air 2 Pro, but I found them more comfortable and the optics worked better for me. The diopter dial above each eye was a game changer as it allowed me to use the glasses with and without my contact lenses on. They work with iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, and gaming platforms like the Nintendo Switch.Also: 3 likely reasons why Quest 3 is more popular with users than other Meta VR headsetsMy long flights to and from Australia flew by with content I downloaded from Apple TV, Netflix, Amazon, and more, along with several games on my Nintendo Switch. The glasses are comfortable, lightweight, and powered by the devices providing the content. In terms of productivity, a single extended display was supported natively from my MacBook Pro and Surface Pro.\\u00a0This single extended display that requires periodic peeking under the glasses to see what's on the laptop offers little enhancement to me, since the high resolution display on the MacBook Pro is top-tier on its own, and better for when I need to get some serious work done. Thus, the Viture One XR glasses are best used for simulating a big screen entertainment from a phone or gaming console.     Matthew Miller/ZDNETBut the Viture One XR glasses still had some tricks up its sleeve. This week, SpaceWalker was publicly released for MacOS and it is a game changer for the Viture One XR glasses.  SpaceWalker is a companion software application that was first available for iOS with fairly limited functionality that was more of a VR technology demonstration rather than a practical application. It is also available now for Android phones, but you should also know that the Viture glasses support Samsung DeX for most Samsung phones.Also:\\u00a0Meta Quest 3 vs. Apple Vision Pro: How accurate was Zuckerberg's review?With SpaceWalker, I now have up to three virtual displays of my computer with settings present to optimize the experience. This function alone propelled the Viture One XR glasses to the top of my list for productivity, and combined with the media and connected gaming support, I am completely satisfied. In my opinion, the Viture One XR glasses ultimately beat out Apple's Vision Pro and the Meta Quest 3 in terms of usefulness across both productivity, gaming, and media applications. There is currently no version of SpaceWalker for Windows, but the ARMoni application looks promising and is next on my list of things to try out.

This article has covered observations made by analysts at IDC and Omdia on the recent developments in the XR industry.\\nDespite a projected stagnation in near-eye display shipments for 2024, the long-term outlook for the market remains positive, Kimi Lin said in a recent Omdia report.\\n\\u201cWith advancements in display, optical, and other component technologies, Omdia is optimistic about the long-term outlook. Near-eye display shipments are projected to grow rapidly from 2027, reaching 92.9 million units by 2030,\\u201d stated Kimi Lin, Senior Research Analyst at Omdia.\\nThe global display industry is set to convene at the Omdia Display Conference from September 12-13, 2024, in Shanghai, China. During the event, Kimi Lin and a team of Omdia analysts will present their research on the latest innovations within the display sector.\\nXR market\\nThe XR market, which includes AR, VR, and MR, is currently facing a downturn, causing significant layoffs at leading companies and prompting several smartphone brands to halt or scale back their XR projects. Despite these setbacks, industry leaders are determined to rejuvenate the market and drive growth in the coming years, Omdia said.\\nFor instance, Microsoft announced layoffs primarily targeting its mixed reality (MR unit, responsible for the HoloLens 2 AR headset.\\nTechnology major Google is cutting hundreds of jobs in its AR (Augmented Reality) hardware and voice assistant businesses, according to reports.\\nAnother tech giant Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs in 2023.\\nChina-based ByteDance-owned virtual reality (VR) headset maker Pico is conducting a new round of\\u00a0job cuts\\u00a0in line with a restructuring.\\nThe latest IDC report said global shipments of augmented reality and virtual reality (AR VR) headsets fell 67.4 percent in the first quarter of 2024 as the market is transitioning to include new categories such as Mixed Reality (MR) and Extended Reality (ER).\\n\\nThe average selling price (ASP) of AR and VR headsets rose to over $1000 as Apple entered the market and incumbents such as Meta focused on premium headsets such as the Quest 3.\\nVirtual Reality headsets are forecast to reach 24.7 million units by the end of 2028, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.2 percent as the consumer base slowly grows beyond core gaming use cases and as businesses adopt more headsets for training, design, and more.\\nAugmented Reality headsets will grow from a smaller base of less than a million units in 2024 to 10.9 million in 2028, representing an 87.1 percent CAGR over the same period, Jitesh Ubrani, research manager,\\u00a0Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers\\u00a0at IDC, said.\\nGrowth plans\\nMeta and PICO plan to launch the Quest 3S and PICO 4S in the second half of 2024, both at lower prices than their predecessors to stimulate sales. Meanwhile, Sony\\u2019s PlayStation VR2 (PS VR2) will now support PC VR games, expanding beyond its previous PS5 exclusivity, which is anticipated to boost PS VR2 sales, Omdia said.\\nIDC report on share of AR VR vendors Q1 2024\\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms has announced the initial release of its XR operating systems to third-party OEMs, including ASUS, Lenovo, and Microsoft Xbox. Meta will also focus on enhancing the quality and quantity of its platform and application software to improve hardware terminal sales.\\nIn 2024, the XR market\\u2019s primary focus will be on the Apple Vision Pro. Its high price is expected to limit its sales, preventing it from significantly boosting overall market growth.\\nOmdia predicts that total XR set shipments in 2024 will remain steady compared to 2023, with near-eye display shipments also flat at 17.2 million units.

It's All About the GPU\\u00a0Laptops that rely on their processors' integrated graphics are useless for VR apps. Check the specs: If your laptop uses Intel HD Graphics, UHD Graphics, Iris Graphics, Iris Xe Graphics, or Intel Arc Graphics (without a model number), it's integrated. Just as when shopping for a gaming laptop or a mobile workstation, your priority must be a discrete or dedicated GPU, and a powerful one. Even avid gamers are often satisfied with a GPU capable of showing 60 frames per second (fps) on a laptop screen or desktop monitor, but on a headset that frame rate can at best look choppy and at worst cause nausea\\u2014a sustained 90fps is more comfortable.\\u00a0(Credit: Molly Flores)The two major pioneering (and now discontinued) VR headsets, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, recommended at least an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or an AMD Radeon RX 480 for tolerable performance in VR. Officially, things haven't changed much\\u2014the advanced, pricey Valve Index specifies the GeForce GTX 1070, and the HTC Vive Pro 2 still only requires a GTX 1060. HP's Reverb G2 headset merely lists any DirectX 12-capable GPU, and a wide range of Quadro and Radeon Pro lines for workstations.You may be familiar with Meta's (formerly Facebook's) Meta Quest headsets, which are referred to as \\\"standalone\\\" since they don't need to be connected to a PC to operate, given their internal hardware guts. They do have an optional cable to use them with your PC for gaming, though, and any GeForce GTX 16-series, or RTX 20-, 30-, or 40-series GPU is supported. (See Meta's list of supported GPUs here.)You won't find those exact chips in modern gaming laptops, though; they have been surpassed. Nevertheless, our advice is to aim higher, at the very least to the neighborhood of the mobile GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (if you can still find one) on the Nvidia side and the Radeon RX 5500M for AMD-based laptops\\u2014or, better yet, a newer GeForce RTX or a Radeon RX series solution.\\u00a0Those GPUs may be the minimum needed to run the headsets, but more demanding games will need better GPUs to run well, just like they would outside of VR.(Credit: Zlata Ivleva)This probably means you won't get away with spending much less than $1,000 on a gaming laptop. In the sub-$1,000 ballpark, you'll likely be torn among options like an RTX 3050, an RTX 3050 Ti, or an RTX 4050, with a relative smattering of Radeon RX 6000-series machines tempting those on Team Red. Of course, if you can spend more, you can get a truly powerful GPU. Among Nvidia's offerings, stepping up to a GeForce RTX 4070, RTX 4080, or RTX 4090 will help you run games at much higher frame rates, even at maximum settings, which may make the difference between a dizzying experience and avoiding motion sickness altogether. For games that are particularly demanding outside of VR, an upper-tier RTX 40-series GPU is recommended.What Processor and Memory Do I Need for VR?\\u00a0Outside of the graphics card, component hardware requirements for VR are easier to hit. As far as the CPU goes, the Vive Pro 2 lists an Intel Core i5-4590 or equivalent. That's a quad-core desktop processor that Intel introduced in 2014, which, needless to say, you won't find in any new desktops or laptops today.The same goes for that Meta Quest Link cable that connects a Quest headset to a PC to play games like Half-Life: Alyx. The minimum for AMD CPUs is equally light\\u2014the Ryzen 5 1500X, a desktop quad-core that dates back to 2017.\\u00a0The HP Reverb G2 lists a minimum requirement of any Core i5, i7, or Ryzen 5, while the Valve Index requires a dual-core CPU as a bare minimum, but recommends four cores or more. This is all to say anything CPU-wise sold in a modern gaming laptop is going to do the job just fine.(Credit: Molly Flores)What to know when looking at CPUs: While four processing cores are a necessity (and six or eight cores naturally better still), any modern (from 10th Generation on) Intel Core i5 laptop chips, or AMD Ryzen 5 4000 or 5000 series ones, will be fine for even the latest VR apps. A Core i7 or a Ryzen 7 will give you ample headroom for future software, and the latest generations of these chips will run games smoothly when paired with the right GPU.\\u00a0What's nice: You'd be hard-pressed to find a current- or previous-generation gaming laptop that won't meet any of those CPU minimums across these headsets. Gaming laptops almost universally use one of Intel's or AMD's H-series CPUs, which are higher-powered processors than the U-series silicon in most thin non-gaming laptops, and a minimum of four cores. Any late-model Core i5, i7, or i9, or a Ryzen 5 or 7 H-series chip, should do the job nicely for VR. (For a much deeper dive, see our guide to understanding laptop CPUs.)As for system memory, the Vive Pro 2 asks for 8GB, as do Meta headsets and HP's Reverb. Since every current gaming laptop comes with at least 8GB of RAM and plenty include 16GB, you won't have to go out of your way for sufficient memory or processing power, unless you're shopping for a used laptop.Which Ports Does My Laptop Need for VR?\\u00a0Being able to plug in all of your headset's required connectors is the main concern here, and realistically more of a limiting factor than the CPU or GPU in your gaming laptop, given the modest spec requirements. Modern VR headsets don't hog three USB ports as the original Oculus Rift did (it required cables for the headset, as well as two wired sensors), but you'll still need to be careful about your new laptop's selection of ports. Knowing which ports you'll need requires checking the fine print.\\u00a0One laptop may be a good fit for one VR headset, but not have what you need for another, so make sure to check the laptop against the specific cabling needs of the VR headset you're using.(Credit: Molly Flores)The Meta Quest 2 and Quest 3's optional Oculus Link is a fancy USB Type-C 3.2 cable, but other headsets like the Vive Pro 2 and the Valve Index require both a USB 3.0 port and a DisplayPort video connector to work with a PC. The HP Reverb G2 asks for a DisplayPort 1.3 and a USB Type-C port.The DisplayPort is critical because many laptops, as mentioned, have an HDMI output but no DisplayPort. An adapter that links a full-size DisplayPort to a mini DisplayPort will work (and is sometimes included with the headset), but an HDMI-to-DisplayPort adapter\\u2014and this is very important to note when shopping\\u2014will not. (We haven't tried a Thunderbolt-to-DisplayPort adapter, but we wouldn't count on it. You want the \\\"real deal\\\" ports to match.) Note that many laptops, gaming and otherwise, now implement the DisplayPort output as a protocol (as opposed to a physical connector) over one or more of the USB-C ports; this can work, but make sure you get the right cables to match.Fortunately, several gaming laptops and some content-creation laptops do have DisplayPort connectors, but triple-checking the necessary mix of ports before you buy a laptop for VR is essential. If you have ports left over beyond what's required, you can chalk that up as a win, since it will allow you to keep other peripherals plugged in alongside the headset without swapping cables.\\u00a0Other VR Laptop Concerns: Screen, Storage, and Battery\\u00a0After meeting the VR hardware requirements, other factors come down to your personal preferences and needs. You'll find 14-inch, 15.6-inch, 16-inch, and 17.3-inch laptops compatible with popular headsets (with some goliath 18-inch models emerging), but of course, you'll wear your headset while playing, not looking at the screen. The display size you pick should depend on how you use your laptop when you're not using VR.\\u00a0(Credit: Molly Flores)Our laptop buying guide will walk you through the pros and cons of different screen sizes. If your work is mostly confined to your desk, a 17.3-inch or even 18-inch notebook is a plus, though some can weigh a barely luggable 8 pounds or more. (Also see our guide to the best 17- and 18-inch laptops, VR-ready and not.) If you'll often take your laptop on the go, a lighter 15.6-inch system makes sense. (Again, check that it has the ports you need; the more compact the machine, the fewer ports it's likely to have.) In addition to the screen size, you'll want to assess the display characteristics, notably the peak refresh rate; modern gaming laptops use panels with faster refresh rates than most older models. (See our guide to whether you need a high-refresh screen.) All laptops have their distinct visual styles as well, ranging from businesslike bland to gamer garish. The difference is subjective, but you don't want to be stuck looking at something you don't like. For example, Alienware machines tend toward flashy; most Gigabyte machines look much more conservative.(Credit: Zlata Ivleva)VR games and apps take up a lot of storage space, so you'll want a machine that can at least hold your favorite titles while letting you rotate others out. Teaming up a speedy solid-state drive (at least 512GB, preferably 1TB) with a larger hard drive is a popular solution. If the laptop of your dreams has room for only one SSD without a supplemental hard drive, buy the highest-capacity SSD you can afford.\\u00a0Battery life is generally less of an issue for gaming and VR laptops than for ultraportables and convertibles because gaming laptops are usually plugged in. Playing on battery rather than AC power usually diminishes performance, and VR is so power-hungry that you'll rely on a wall outlet for all but the shortest explorations.\\u00a0Ready to Buy the Right Laptop for VR?\\u00a0The systems outlined here represent the best VR-ready laptops we've reviewed. Also check out our roundups of the best gaming laptops (VR abilities aside)\\u2014or, if you decide to keep things wholly at home, the best gaming desktops, most of which can easily handle VR duties, so long as they're equipped with at least the minimum recommended graphics card for the VR headset you have.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompare SpecsThe Best Laptops for VR in 2024Our Pick\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLenovo Legion Pro 7i Gen 9 16\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMSI Cyborg 15 (2023)\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAlienware m18 R2\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 (2024)\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLenovo Legion 7i Gen 9\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMSI Titan 18 HX\\n\\nSee It\\n\\nEditor's RatingEditors' Choice 4.5 ExcellentReview 4.0 ExcellentReview 4.0 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.5 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.0 ExcellentReview 4.0 ExcellentReviewClassGamingGamingGamingGamingGamingGaming, Desktop ReplacementProcessorIntel Core i9-14900HXIntel Core i7-13620HIntel Core i9-14900HXAMD Ryzen 9 8945HSIntel Core i9-14900HXIntel Core i9-14900HXProcessor Speed2.2RAM (as Tested)3216323232128Boot Drive TypeSSDSSDSSDSSDSSDSSDBoot Drive Capacity (as Tested)15122114Secondary Drive TypeHard DriveSecondary Drive Capacity (as Tested)1Optical DriveScreen Size1615.618141618Native Display Resolution2560 by 16001920 by 10802560 by 16002,880 by 1,8002560 x 16003840 by 2400Touch ScreenPanel TechnologyIPSIPSIPSOLEDIPSMini LEDVariable Refresh SupportG-SyncNoneG-SyncG-SyncNoneNoneScreen Refresh Rate240144165120240120Graphics ProcessorNvidia GeForce RTX 4080 Laptop GPUNvidia GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPUNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPUNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPUNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Laptop GPUNvidia GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPUGraphics Memory126168816Wireless NetworkingWi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth802.11ax, Bluetooth 5.1Wi-Fi 7, BluetoothWi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth802.11ax, Bluetooth 5.3Wi-Fi 7, BluetoothDimensions (HWD)1.01 by 14.3 by 10.3 inches0.9 by 14.1 by 9.85 inches1.05 by 16.2 by 12.6 inches0.64 by 12.2 by 8.7 inches0.78 by 14.1 by 10.3 inches1.25 by 15.9 by 12 inchesWeight6.174.58.93.34.97.93Operating SystemWindows 11 HomeWindows 11 HomeWindows 11Windows 11 HomeWindows 11 HomeWindows 11Tested Battery Life (Hours:Minutes)8:047:166:4511:526:232:53\\nMore Inside PCMag.com\\nThe Best Graphics Cards for VR in 2024\\nThe Best Gaming PCs for 2024\\nThe Best Gaming Laptops for 2024\\nThe Best VR Headsets for 2024\\n\\n\\nAbout Eric Grevstad\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI was picked to write the \\\"20 Most Influential PCs\\\" feature for PCMag's 40th Anniversary coverage because I remember them all\\u2014I started on a TRS-80 magazine in 1982 and served as editor of Computer Shopper when it was a 700-page monthly.

While some frames cater to open-ear audio or AI assistance, AR smart glasses like the VITURE (pronounced \\u201cvihh-chure\\u201d) Pro XR act like portable monitors \\u2014 capable of projecting a large virtual display perfect for gaming or watching TV and movies.There\\u2019s plenty of AR glasses competition from brands like Rokid, XREAL, and RayNeo. However, VITURE\\u2019s combination of quality hardware and easy-to-use software has typically seen the brand labeled as the most well-rounded offering on the market \\u2014 although that does come hand-in-hand with being one of the more expensive options available. Do the company's latest Pro XR smart glasses continue to impress? Let\\u2019s find out.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: DesignWhile smart glasses can come in a range of designs, with the Solos AirGo 3 particularly excelling when it comes to frame diversity, most AR/XR smart glasses attempt to style themselves on the classic Wayfarer style \\u2014 though this look is only authentically available with the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.However, VITURE has captured the essence of Ray-Ban\\u2019s iconic frames pretty well while making obvious adjustments to house the tech within. These glasses very much feel like they might be the Wayfarers of tomorrow. Chunkier temples feature open-ear stereo speakers and an action button and volume rocker on the underside of the left arm.VITURE's Pro XR Glasses are styled like a gently futuristic redesign of Ray-Ban's iconic Wayfarer sunglasses. They're a little chunky in places, and fall victim to the same \\\"floating off your face\\\" look that other AR glasses do, however, they remain comfortable even over long spans and don't look half bad when worn. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)A similar increase in bulk is found across the top of the frames, which is needed to make room for each eye\\u2019s bottom-firing micro-OLED display projections \\u2013 and sadly maintains the quirky \\u201clifting off the face\\u201d look that many AR glasses suffer from. These projections land on secondary, prism-like lenses found behind the main electrochromic film lenses, which can be activated with a single press of the action button to block out up to 99.5% of external light and enhance immersion while in use.The prism-like secondary lenses may take some getting used to at first, and while there\\u2019s a clear visual definition between the two, it can be jarring. Eventually, your eyes tune out their presence \\u2014 though their surface is much more reflective than the main lenses. This can manifest some distracting mirroring in brighter environments while the glasses aren\\u2019t in use or the display is anchored to the corner of your sight.Unlike other AR glasses that require sometimes costly lens inserts for vision adjustment, VITURE's Pro XR glasses include twin myopia adjustment dials to ensure you can see the virtual displays with crystal clarity without your regular prescription lenses. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)Two myopia adjustment dials, also present on the chunkier front frames, aid those with nearsightedness. These dials allow you to fine-tune the focus for each eye (0.0D to -5.0D) and ensure you\\u2019re getting the most crisp results possible from the virtual displays.Finally, these lightweight (77 grams) frames feature a proprietary magnetic pin connection at the end of the right temple tip, which allows hassle-free connection to the glasses\\u2019 USB Type-C data cable, which connects to your device of choice.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: SetupIf you want to use VITURE Pro XR glasses with home or handheld consoles like the PS5, Nintendo Switch, Asus ROG Ally, or Steam Deck, you\\u2019ll need to invest in the VITURE Pro Mobile Dock.Using the glasses themselves is simple. Connecting the aforementioned USB Type-C cable to the right temple tip and any compatible device (Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, featuring a USB-C DisplayPort/DP Alt Mode-supporting port) instantly activates screen mirroring as the glasses\\u2019 micro-OLED projectors kick in.You don\\u2019t need to worry about drivers or software with this use case. The VITURE Pro XR smart glasses essentially act as a plug-and-play monitor. However, this will only result in a static virtual display with little to no customization available for positioning the screen or engaging in 3DoF (Three Degrees of Freedom), AR-like interactions.The VITURE Mobile Dock allows you to unleash the true potential of your handheld console/gaming PC by presenting the same large-picture virtual displays and providing 13,000 mAh of additional charge to your device. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)If you want to use VITURE Pro XR glasses with home or handheld consoles like the PS5, Nintendo Switch, Asus ROG Ally, or Steam Deck, you\\u2019ll need to invest in the VITURE Pro Mobile Dock ($129). This accessory unlocks 3D content support and acts as a docking station (that allows two VITURE smart glasses to be connected simultaneously and HDMI connections) and a portable power bank with a 13,000 mAh battery.\\u00a0VITURE Pro XR Glasses: SoftwareTo use those more advanced visual features, you\\u2019ll need to download and install the SpaceWalker app. SpaceWalker is available for iOS/iPadOS, Android, and now Windows, giving users a spatial sandbox that includes a web browser and media player. While that doesn\\u2019t sound like much, it is enough to be able to make use of web versions of apps like YouTube, Netflix, and Prime Video.The benefit of doing this through SpaceWalker is that VITURE\\u2019s app also allows for 3DoF tracking, allowing you to turn away from your virtual screen or more comfortably view content. SpaceWalker also allows media or web pages to be clipped to the corners of your view and scaled in size to suit your needs.This can let you prepare and cook a meal while following along with a video tutorial that doesn\\u2019t impede your full vision, or catch up on some YouTube videos while getting around town without worrying about bowling over the locals because your entire field of vision was being taken up with \\u201cMemes for the Boys part 62.\\u201dSpaceWalker for Windows and macOS unlocks a more familiar spatial computing experience, where the Pro XR's headtracking is put to use to add an extra dimension to your virtual displays with full 3DoF rendering. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)SpaceWalker for macOS is a whole other ballgame. Here, you\\u2019ll be able to engage in a much truer spatial computing experience. Connecting the VITURE smart glasses to a MacBook running SpaceWalker unlocks a multitude of virtual display options, including stunning ultrawide 21:9 floating displays and the ability to shrink and grow the scale of displays with ease.The Windows version of SpaceWalker has only recently been released and can be a little buggy at times. However, it\\u2019s safe to expect that VITURE will bring the app up to speed in the coming months.There\\u2019s no current rival to VITURE\\u2019s offerings on the software front, at least not from smart glasses manufacturers themselves (though there are some excellent pieces of third-party software available online). While XREAL has the most similar offering in terms of design, style, picture, and audio, VITURE is one of the only AR smart glasses companies to deliver such compelling, widely-supported, easy-to-use, and impactful software.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: DisplayAR glasses like VITURE\\u2019s use an interesting projection method to present virtual screens before your eyes. Rather than the image appearing directly on the lens, two Sony micro-OLED panels beam an image into a secondary lens that redirects each image toward your eyes.The result is quite impressive, to say the least. With a bright, 135-inch virtual panel before you at all times. There\\u2019s a full-HD (1920 x 1080) per-eye resolution to enjoy with refresh rates of up to 120Hz \\u2014 which is especially excellent for speedy, responsive gaming through the glasses.The Pro XR's twin lenses can be hard to adjust to at first, vision through the glasses won't ever be 100% comfortable when you're not making use of the micro-OLED displays, but it's by no means impossible to acclimatize to. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)One downside to the AR glasses form factor is that your FoV (Field of View) is more restricted than when using a VR/AR headset like the Meta Quest 3. The Pro XR glasses have a narrower 46-degree FoV, resulting in a more tightly packed area from which you can view the projected image. In contrast, the Quest 3\\u2019s pancake lenses offer a much larger 110-degree FoV, offering over twice the screen space with which to enjoy content.Pictures are bright and crisp, and whether I was watching movies or playing games, I never felt the glasses lacking in visual quality or performance. Better still, watching 3D content on the glasses is absolutely stunning and simple to perform. Simply holding down the action button on the left temple switches to SBS (Side-by-Side) vision, allowing the full 3D experience in games and media.Capturing the virtual displays through the lenses is a tricky task, and this picture by no means does the unwarped, crisp, and clear presentation of the virtual screens any justice. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)The VITURE Pro XR smart glasses are excellent for gaming. They deliver speedy refresh rates and capture the striking and varied colors of CD Projekt Red\\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077. The enormous virtual display pulls you further into titles, and your immersion is peaked when you enable the electrochromic lenses that block out the surrounding light almost entirely.\\u00a0VITURE Pro XR Glasses: AudioThe VITURE Pro XR\\u2019s audio's open-ear design lets you enjoy media or games without shutting off the rest of the world. The Harmon-tuned audio is definitely rich in quality, and the audio bleed is very well-contained.Setting the glasses down while playing a range of music videos and movies at peak volume, I lost track of much of the audio at only a few feet in distance. This makes them ideal for commutes or on-the-go watching, as you won\\u2019t be annoying those around you by unwantedly blaring the contents of your watchlist in their general direction.The open-ear speakers housed within the Pro XR's temples offer excellent audio, though they do fall short against other AR glasses when it comes to maximum volume. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)However, that\\u2019s likely because the VITURE Pro XR\\u2019s speakers are relatively quiet compared to others. The XREAL Air 2 glasses are also open-ear in design but offer much more of a kick, making them better suited for noisier or less isolated environments. This does, however, negatively impact the frames when it comes to audio bleed.All in all, the Pro XR\\u2019s speakers strike a fair balance and are more than enjoyable while at home or in less bustling locations. For those who want to dial things up to 11, there\\u2019s always the option to switch over to a pair of Bluetooth earbuds or headphones.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: Price and availabilityThe VITURE Pro XR smart glasses are available for $549, though currently discounted to $459 for early adopters.At face value, that\\u2019s a sizeable sum for a pair of high-tech shades, though it\\u2019s not an uncommon price for smart glasses of its ilk. The $399 XREAL Air 2 AR glasses offer similar features, but options like the VITURE Pro XR\\u2019s electrochromic film lenses are reserved for the more expensive $449 Air 2 Pro model.VITURE's Pro XR Glasses (front) are a step up from XREAL's Air 2 AR glasses (rear), offering an electrochromic panel that can be activated to blank out all but the brightest of lights and greatly improve immersion. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)However, XREAL\\u2019s offerings lack the myopia adjustment dials of VITURE\\u2019s glasses, leaving some glasses wearers needing to rely on potentially expensive lens inserts to see the virtual displays clearly.Of course, at that price, it\\u2019s worth considering the expanded functions and capabilities of VR/AR headsets like the $499 Meta Quest 3. That being said, the improvements to the overall AR experience from the Quest 3 will come at the cost of a bulkier, heavier, and less welcoming form factor.\\u00a0Bottom lineVITURE\\u2019s AR smart glasses offering is a well-rounded assortment of accessories and software that pushes the AR/XR experience that frames like this can deliver. There\\u2019s truly no smoother or fleshed-out experience as the one offered here \\u2014 at least for now.Forget spatial computing. Pick up a pair of VITURE's Pro XR glasses and give facial computing a try instead.My only major gripe is that the complete experience is costly. VITURE\\u2019s frames alone have an intimidating price tag to some, so having to invest even more to get the most from your handheld or home console may be asking too much of general consumers.However, as a plug-and-play pair of AR smart glasses, the core product is still considerably impressive, thanks to the awesome SpaceWalker software available across mobile and desktop platforms.Yes, the AR experience is a little more expansive and impressive through the lenses of a VR/AR headset. However, they're far less accommodating when it comes to comfort or wearing while out and about. As such, unless you're looking to take advantage of VR/AR gaming, forget spatial computing. Pick up a pair of VITURE's Pro XR glasses and give facial computing a try instead.More from Laptop MagWhat are smart glasses?

Since then, we've tested every major VR headset, including experimental AR devices like Google Glass and the Microsoft HoloLens (not to mention the growing variety of smart glasses). These days, there are headsets in every shape, size, and price, from the entry-level, wire-free Meta Quest 2 to the PC-tethered standby Valve Index to the class-leading Apple Vision Pro. We've thoroughly tested each of these models, evaluating them for their graphical capabilities, motion tracking, software library, comfort, user experience, and value.

Whatever you call it (we consider it an AR/VR/mixed reality headset), the Vision Pro is an incredibly ambitious device that's good for work or play. The headset relies entirely on eye and hand tracking for controls that enable a far more intuitive and natural control system than any we've tested. As a first-generation device on a newly launched platform, VisionOS, it's surprisingly full-featured, with some of the best hardware ever put into a consumer-available, head-mounted display.Who It's ForPeople with deep pockets. The Vision Pro costs $3,500, several times more than any other headset we've tested. That's expensive, even for early adopters. If you're willing to spend that much money on a new AR/VR experience, go for it. Just recognize that Apple will probably make even better and/or cheaper versions in the next few years. In addition, the Vision Pro has a few software omissions and stability issues that can be fixed with patches, but the headset's front-heavy balance can't.ProsBest AR/VR interface we've seenClass-leading eye and hand trackingNo physical controllers neededSharp, colorful displayOutstanding video passthroughPlenty of visionOS apps and featuresConsExpensiveShort battery lifeFront-heavy design gets uncomfortableGaps in iPad app compatibilityLearn MoreApple Vision Pro Review\\nMeta Quest 3Best Standalone VR Headset4.5 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItThe Meta Quest 3 is $200 more than the Quest 2, but it adds color pass-through cameras that make augmented reality experiences feasible, along with a higher resolution and a faster processor\\u2014a processor that packs more power than even the Quest Pro. In fact, the only thing the Pro has over this headset is its awesome eye-tracking technology.Who It's ForWant to experience VR without cables? This is the standalone headset for you. The Quest 3 is wireless, powerful, sharp, and you can see through it in color. The Quest 2 is a good starting point if you're looking to spend less, but the Quest 3 is enough of a step forward that it's worth the extra cash.ProsColor pass-through cameras allow you to clearly see your surroundingsHigh-resolution picturePowerful processorComfortable designConsShort battery lifeLacks eye-tracking techGet It NowSee ItLearn MoreMeta Quest 3 Review\\nMeta Quest ProBest for Pros and Enthusiasts4.0 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItThe Meta Quest Pro is an impressive headset that features cool eye-tracking and face-tracking tech. It costs significantly more than the Quest 2 and Quest 3, however, so you really need to be sold on the eye tracking before you buy in.Who It's ForThe Meta Quest Pro is for professionals who need a capable VR headset for collaboration purposes, and for enthusiasts who want to play with the excellent eye-tracking and face-tracking tech.ProsImproved design with a more comfortable fit than the Quest 2Cool eye- and face-tracking techColor pass-through cameraRechargeable headset and controllersDoesn't require a PC to operateConsExpensiveMeta Horizon's metaverse is often empty and sometimes buggyShort battery lifeGet It NowSee ItLearn MoreMeta Quest Pro Review\\nMeta Quest 2Best Affordable VR Headset4.5 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItThe Quest 2 (formerly the Oculus Quest 2)\\u00a0is Meta's $300 standalone VR headset. It's affordable for a VR platform, and you don't need cables or additional hardware. It's powered by mobile components, specifically the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 chipset, and that's enough to run entertaining VR experiences. It has an incredibly robust library of those experiences, so you'll find something entertaining. You can also use it as a PC-powered headset with the $79 Link Cable.Who It's ForThis is a top VR headset, but its follow-up, the Meta Quest 3, is more compelling in every way (including a faster processor, a higher-resolution display, and color pass-through cameras). The Quest 3 also costs $200 more, which means the Quest 2 is the best budget-friendly VR headset you can buy. If you want to explore VR without spending a lot of money, this is a terrific starting point.ProsDoesn't require any cablesSharp displayPowerful processorAccurate motion trackingOptional PC tethering via accessory cableConsShort battery lifeGet It NowSee ItLearn MoreMeta Quest 2 Review\\nPlayStation VR2Best for PlayStation 5 Gamers4.5 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItThe PlayStation VR 2 is a significant upgrade over the original that combines the PlayStation 5's power with new eye-tracking and motion-control tech that makes VR games even more immersive. Plus, the lightweight headset has impressive specs, including a sharp OLED display that delivers a 2,000-by-2,040-pixel picture to each eye.Who It's ForThe PS VR2 is for gamers willing to go all-in on Sony's next-generation vision of virtual reality. After all, the headset's not inexpensive at nearly $600 and it lacks backward compatibility with original PlayStation VR games (which is why that model is still on this list). However, this comfortable and impressive hardware has a strong launch library that includes Horizon: Call of the Mountain and the Jurassic World Aftermath Collection.ProsExcellent graphics and soundStrong launch libraryUseful eye-tracking techLightweight buildEasy to set upConsNot compatible with PlayStation VR gamesGet It NowSee ItLearn MorePlayStation VR2 Review\\nValve Index VR KitBest Controllers4.0 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItValve's PC-tethered VR headset is pricey, and on paper it doesn't stand out much from the competition. The headset is just one part of the VR experience, though, and the Valve Index really impresses because of the other major component: the controllers. They're revolutionary, able to rack individual finger movements and make games (that take advantage of the feature) much more immersive than the standard trigger grips on other controllers. It's amazing to see your fingers wiggle in Half-Life: Alyx. The headset itself, while not outstanding, still offers crisp, smooth graphics with a high refresh rate, too. The system integrates with Valve's Steam store through SteamVR, so there's an incredibly large library of VR games, even if only a tiny fraction might bother with the finger support.Who It's ForThis is the go-to VR headset for use with PCs, thanks to its strong performance and revolutionary controllers. If you're just starting with VR on PC, go with this one. If you already have a SteamVR-compatible headset, though, such as the HTC Vive, the Vive Cosmos Elite (not the regular Cosmos), or the Vive Pro 2 along with their base stations, you can buy the controllers for $280 to breathe new life into your VR experience without investing in the full Valve Index system.ProsImmersive, finger-tracking controllersHigh, 120Hz refresh rate delivers smooth motionLots of VR software available on PC via SteamVRConsExpensiveOccasionally frustrating tethered designGet It NowSee ItLearn MoreValve Index VR Kit Review\\nHTC Vive Pro 2Best for the Highest-Resolution VR4.0 ExcellentWhy We Picked ItThis advanced, semi-consumer VR headset targets both enthusiasts and professionals with the sharpest picture available at 2,448 by 2,448 pixels per eye. It easily offers the best visuals we've seen in VR so far, though at a hefty price: The headset alone is $799, and that doesn't factor in the base stations and controllers (but on the bright side, you can use the Valve Index controllers with it).It works with SteamVR just like the Index, and has its own VR software store in the form of Viveport. The store offers the subscription-based\\u00a0Viveport Infinity\\u00a0service that provides unlimited access to VR experiences, instead of a la carte software purchases. That's a nice bonus outside of SteamVR.Who It's ForIf you want the best VR experience available without diving into pro-level extremes, the Vive Pro 2 combined with Valve Index controllers is the combination to go with. It'll cost you at least $1,300 before factoring in a PC with the specs to take advantage of the headset's power, but you'll enjoy amazing visuals and controls.ProsThe best resolution for VR gamingSmooth motion trackingWorks with Valve Index controllersConsExpensiveDoesn't include necessary base stations or controllersGet It NowSee ItLearn MoreHTC Vive Pro 2 Review\\nBuying Guide: The Best VR Headsets for 2024\\n\\n\\nWhich VR Headset Is the Best?Modern VR headsets now fit under one of two categories: tethered or standalone. Tethered headsets, such as the HTC Vive Pro 2, PlayStation VR, and Valve Index are physically connected to PCs (or in the case of the PS VR 2, a\\u00a0PlayStation 5). Their cables makes them a bit unwieldy, but putting all of the video processing in a box that you don't need to directly strap to your face means your VR experience can be a lot more complex. Either external sensors or outward-facing cameras provide full 6DOF (six degrees of freedom) movement tracking for both your head and your hands, thanks to motion-sensing controllers.The least expensive tethered options are currently around $400, and that's before you address the processing issue; the HP Reverb G2, Valve Index, and Vive Pro 2 need\\u00a0powerful PCs\\u00a0to run, while the PS VR requires a PlayStation 4 and the PS VR2 requires a PlayStation 5.Standalone headsets offer the greatest physical freedom by completely removing the cables and not requiring an external device to handle processing. The Meta Quest 2, Quest Pro, and Quest 3 use similar outward-facing cameras to the now-discontinued Oculus Rift S to provide 6DOF motion tracking, and similar 6DOF motion controls. They lack a dedicated gaming PC's processing power on their own, but their high-end mobile processors (especially the Quest Pro's Snapdragon XR2+) push detailed, smooth graphics. They also support PC-tethered VR with an optional cable.(Credit: Joseph Maldonado)The Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced of the standalone headsets by far, and the most advanced headset in general. Apple doesn't call it a VR headset but rather a \\\"spatial computer,\\\" but as a device it's very similar to the Quest Pro. It relies entirely on eye and hand tracking for control and has the most intuitive interface we've seen by far. It's also $3,500, which is a huge ask compared with any other headset in this list. It's also a first-generation device on a new platform, even if the platform (VisionOS) is built on iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS.Sony \\\"spatial reality\\\" headset(Credit: Sony)Sony's \\\"spatial reality\\\" headset announced at CES 2024 is the other model to keep an eye on. Details are scant, but Sony says it will run on a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ chip, indicating it could be standalone headset like the Meta Quest. More interesting are its controllers: a ring and a wand that are designed for \\\"intuitive interaction with 3D objects and precise pointing.\\\" Aimed at content creators, it could be a major release for VTubers and other streamers.Which VR Headset Is Best for the Metaverse?Meta emphasizes that the Quest 2, Quest 3, and Quest Pro are all devices for its \\\"metaverse,\\\" which is still fairly ill-defined apart from a few specific apps under the Meta Horizon name. It remains a vague concept, but the Quest headsets are the best jumping-off points for exploring the company's vision. Our metaverse guide will help you understand what's happening, based on the few hard details.Meta's vision of the metaverse hasn't really panned out, and the aforementioned Horizon Worlds app is a ghost town. On the other hand, platforms and games that don't call themselves metaverse like Roblox and VRChat have effectively become popular multimedia experiences crafted and curated by users. You can also use them outside of VR.The Best Augmented Reality (AR) HeadsetsYou might have seen other headsets pop up over the last few years, including the\\u00a0Microsoft HoloLens\\u00a0and the\\u00a0Magic Leap One. They aren't on this list for a few reasons, but the biggest one is that they're augmented reality (AR) headsets, not virtual reality headsets. And yes,\\u00a0there's a difference.Basically, these AR headsets have transparent lenses that let you look at your surroundings instead of completely replacing your vision with a computer-generated image. They project images over whatever you're looking at, but those images are designed to complement and interact with the area around you. You can make a web browser pop up in the middle of a room, for instance, or watch animals run around your coffee table. It's fascinating technology that could\\u00a0hint at the future of computing.The emphasis here is on the future, as in several years away. That brings us to the second biggest reason the HoloLens and Magic Leap One aren't in this list: They aren't consumer products. Both devices are purely intended as development hardware, so AR software can be made for their platforms. Considering each headset costs several thousand dollars, you shouldn't expect a large library of AR experiences for a while. Outside of specific enterprise and education uses, AR headsets are an early adopter playground at best, and not for most people.The Apple Vision Pro is the closest to a comprehensive AR headset we've seen, and the Meta Quest Pro isn't too far behind it. They use passthrough cameras instead of transparent lenses, so your view of your surroundings won't be as clear as transparent displays, but they still show everything around you, in color, and scan those surroundings to properly place virtual objects in that space.If you can't wait for the technology to mature or become more affordable, we've found several consumer-available smart glasses that are very useful, though don't deliver on actual augmented reality. They project large images in front of your eyes and can have limited head tracking to keep that virtual screen fixed in place before you, and make great privacy-minded external monitors if you want to watch movies, play games, or work on the go.With that in mind, we'll continue to track the best new VR headsets as they are released, so make sure to check back soon for updates. And after you find the right headset, check out our list of the best VR games.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompare SpecsThe Best VR Headsets for 2024Our Pick\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeta Quest 3\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeta Quest Pro\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeta Quest 2\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlayStation VR2\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nValve Index VR Kit\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHTC Vive Pro 2\\n\\nSee It\\n\\nEditor's Rating 4.0 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.5 ExcellentReview 4.0 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.5 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.5 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.0 ExcellentReview 4.0 ExcellentReviewTypeStandaloneStandaloneStandaloneStandaloneTetheredTetheredTetheredResolution22 million pixels2,064 by 2,208 (per eye)1,920 by 1,800 (per eye)1,832 by 1,920 (per eye)2,000 by 2,040 (per eye)1,600 by 1,440 (per eye)2,440 by 2,440 (per eye)Refresh Rate10012090120120120120Motion Detection6DOF6DOF6DOF6DOF6DOF6DOF6DOFControlsEye and hand trackingMeta Quest Touch ControllersMotion ControllersOculus TouchPlayStation VR2 SenseValve Index ControllersNone IncludedHardware PlatformApple M2StandaloneStandaloneStandalonePlayStation 5PCPCSoftware PlatformApple VisionOSMetaMetaOculusPlayStation 5SteamVRSteamVR\\nMore Inside PCMag.com\\nThe Best Graphics Cards for VR in 2024\\nThe Best Laptops for VR in 2024\\nThe Best VR Games for 2024\\nThe Best Smart Glasses for 2024\\n\\n\\nAbout Will Greenwald\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\u2019ve been PCMag\\u2019s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them.

You won't need much to just play simple video on a VR headset, and even a high-end smartphone can deliver a basic VR experience, as mentioned in our intro. But things get more complicated if you want to power and run games in VR.First: A Look at the Headset SpecsTo create the VR experience, most HMDs utilize two displays\\u2014one for each eye lens. This helps to create the immersive illusion that makes VR what it is, but it is also a big part of what forces you to buy powerful PC hardware for VR. The hardware has to drive separate images for each lens, and this effectively doubles the workload.Valve's Index VR HMD, for example, has displays in each lens that have a resolution of 1,600 by 1,440, which is roughly equivalent to a 1080p monitor for each eye. Each display also operates at a 120Hz refresh rate. This makes rendering a game for the Index similar to trying to drive two 1080p monitors at 120Hz, which, even today, isn't so easy when you're dealing with demanding, graphically impressive game titles.This workload only increases with other HMDs, like the Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and HTC Vive Pro 2, all of which have even higher-resolution displays. The new Meta Quest 3 has a resolution of 2,064 by 2,208 per eye, which gives each eyepiece a higher pixel count than a standard 1440p monitor and the two together display more pixels than a 4K display. This makes rendering games with peak visual quality on the Meta Quest 3 more demanding than gaming at 4K and limits you to using only the best available graphics cards if you want to avoid turning down the graphics settings. Older HMDs are less demanding, but those come at the cost of lesser image quality.What Your VR PC Needs: The Minimum SpecsNo matter which of these headsets you buy, you're going to need a relatively powerful gaming PC. If your PC isn't fast enough, you'll end up having to reduce image quality, which will make for a less immersive experience. At the bottom end of the requirements, you could also end up with an inconsistent refresh rate, which can be quite disorienting and ruin your VR fun.Intel's Core i5-13600K processor(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)For the most part, the hardware you'll want for VR gaming won't differ much from what you'd want for any modern gaming PC. A wide range of processors will work well for this task; AMD's Ryzen 7 5700X, AMD's Ryzen 7 7700X, and Intel's Core i5-13600K are some of the best current-gen options, though a CPU a generation or two older would be just fine. Indeed VR will work on CPU tech much older than even that. The minimum CPU/GPU requirements for the major headsets are as follows. Note that the Meta headsets are designed primarily as standalone devices, but can be hooked up to PCs for connected use with PC-centric VR games via the Quest Link accessory cable.Meta Quest 2 and 3, or Quest Pro (via Meta Quest Link cable)Intel Core i5-4590, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X, or betterNvidia GeForce GTX 1060/GTX 1650 Super, AMD Radeon RX 400 series, or betterHTC Vive Pro 2Intel Core i5-4590, AMD Ryzen 1500 equivalent, or betterNvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD Radeon RX 480 or greater (GeForce RTX 20 series or Radeon 5000 series, or later, to operate in Full Resolution mode)Valve Index VRDual-core processor with Hyper-Threading (quad-core recommended)Nvidia GeForce GTX 970, AMD Radeon RX 480, or better (GTX 1070 or better recommended)The HMD makers generally cite a minimum of 8GB of main system memory, but it would also be best if you picked up 16GB of RAM, as well as an NVMe M.2 SSD to help with loading games faster.AMD's Ryzen 7 5700X processor(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)The graphics card requires a bit more consideration for a VR gaming PC. With a regular gaming desktop, playing ordinary games, turning down the resolution or even the refresh rate is always an option without incurring any serious negative consequences. This means you can game on any PC with just about any graphics card. Having a less-powerful graphics card in that situation only limits your game selection and how detailed and crisp your games will look.In VR, things are a bit different. As we mentioned earlier, inconsistent frame rates can ruin your VR experience. Don't downplay the necessity of that: Frame-rate smoothness matters a lot more in VR than it does in traditional gaming because judder and screen tearing while you're moving your head around in a virtual world can cause dizziness and nausea, and be a game-ender.Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4090 GPU(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)Both AMD and Nvidia have powerful graphics cards that are more than capable of driving a high-end VR experience. As you can see from the minimum specs above, a GeForce GTX card will do for VR basics; following from that, any of Nvidia's more powerful GeForce RTX GPUs are up to the challenge of gaming in VR. When you're shopping for a VR card, that means while you need to avoid very low-end or older cards, you necessarily don't have to spend to the sky. The older, \\\"Turing\\\"-based GeForce RTX 20 Series cards can still be found as more budget-friendly options, and the newer \\\"Ampere\\\"-based GeForce RTX 30 cards will more than suffice. With that in mind, the newest high-end cards, in the \\\"Ada Lovelace\\\"-based GeForce RTX 40 Series, will certainly do an even better job with higher-end HMDs, but they are overkill unless you can use the extra power for 4K or 1440p gaming outside of VR.AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XT GPU(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)Many of AMD's midrange and high-end cards from the last few generations are also up to the task. The older\\u00a0Radeon RX 5700\\u00a0and\\u00a0RX 5700 XT are some of the better budget options here, as their prices have dropped, though you could also benefit from the newer RDNA 2-based cards like the Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT. AMD's newest graphics cards, based on the RDNA 3 architecture, are (like the GeForce RTX 40 Series) if anything overkill for many VR HMDs. But if you want to be ready for the newest VR games of 2024, and game at very high resolution outside of VR, they are the best option.How High End a Graphics Card Should I Get for VR?To avoid issues with poor performance, you really need to shoot for a powerful graphics card that's up to the task of running modern AAA VR titles. Though it's hard to argue that any graphics card is too fast for VR, opting for a card like an AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT or an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, at a minimum, is a good idea for high-end HMDs, even though their minimum GPU specs are much lower.If you've got more to spend, then there's no harm in going straight for some of the best cards on the market, like AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XT or Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4080 Super. (The RTX 4090 is awesomely fast, but awesomely expensive, too.) Both are extremely powerful, but that's the point. These will drive games in VR with ease and can run games at 1440p or 4K when you don't feel like playing in VR. If these high-enders are out of your price range, but you're still looking for something that's a step above the VR GPU baseline, the best middle-ground card is one based on the GeForce RTX 4060, or even the GeForce RTX 3060, if you can still find one on the market.You can always try to scrape by with lower-end cards, but this could leave you unable to run newer games at fast enough refresh rates for you to enjoy the experience. Depending on what games you intend to play, you certainly can do this. But if you're new to VR, which you likely are if you are here, it's best to aim for something like one of the cards we just mentioned to drive a high-quality experience and get the most out of your HMD, and your monitor, for when you're not in VR. (After all, no one can stay in there all the time.) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompare SpecsThe Best Graphics Cards for VR in 2024Our Pick\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZotac Gaming Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super Trinity Black Edition 16GB GDDR6X\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XT\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAMD Radeon RX 7800 XT\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAMD Radeon RX 7600\\n\\nSee It\\n\\nEditor's Rating 3.5 GoodReviewEditors' Choice 4.0 ExcellentReview 4.0 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.5 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.5 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.5 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.0 ExcellentReviewGraphics ProcessorNvidia AD103Nvidia AD102AMD Navi 31Nvidia AD104AMD Navi 32Nvidia AD107AMD Navi 33GPU Base Clock2340223920001980212418302250GPU Boost Clock2610252024002475243025052625Graphics Memory TypeGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6GDDR6GDDR6Graphics Memory Amount162420121688DVI OutputsHDMI Outputs1111111DisplayPort Outputs3323333VirtualLink OutputsNumber of Fans3232222Card WidthdoubletripledoubledoubledoubledoubledoubleCard Length12.11210.91010.598Board Power or TDP285450315220263115165Power Connector(s)12VHPWR4 8-pin (12VHPWR)2 8-pin12VHPWR2 8-pin1 8-pin1 8-pin\\nMore Inside PCMag.com\\nThe Best Graphics Cards for 2021\\nThe Best Graphics Cards for Compact PCs in 2024\\nThe Best Graphics Cards for 4K Gaming in 2024\\nThe Best Graphics Cards for 1080p Gaming in 2024\\n\\n\\nAbout John Burek\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI have been a technology journalist for almost 30 years and have covered just about every kind of computer gear\\u2014from the 386SX to 64-core processors\\u2014in my long tenure as an editor, a writer, and an advice columnist.

A comparison with top buying options \\nFAQs\\nQuestion : What is the difference between a smartwatch with Bluetooth calling and one without?\\nAns : Smartwatches with Bluetooth calling allow you to make and receive calls directly from your wrist, acting as an extension of your phone. Models without this feature can still receive notifications and alerts but require you to use your phone for calls.\\nQuestion : What is the significance of IPX ratings for earphones?\\nAns : IPX ratings indicate the level of water and dust resistance.

Over-ear headphones generally offer better sound isolation and comfort for extended wear, while on-ear headphones are often more portable.\\nQuestion : Do I need a powerful phone to use a VR headset?\\nAns : Most VR headsets require a smartphone with a gyroscope and accelerometer for head tracking. The performance of the VR experience will also depend on your phone's processing power and display resolution.\\nQuestion : What kind of content can I experience with a VR headset?\\nAns : VR headsets offer a wide range of experiences, including 360-degree videos, immersive games, virtual tours, and educational content.

And I mean that word in a good way, because it's actually a useful one.Are the Xreal Air 2 Pro worth the $449 (\\u20ac515 in Europe), or should you stick to the more affordable $399 Xreal Air instead? Let's find out\\u2026Jump to:SpecsDesign, build qualityFit, comfort and adjustabilityControls and electrochromic dimmingImage quality: watching movies, gaming on the Steam Deck, working on an iPad, MacBookConnectivityXreal Beam, companion appSpeakersVerdictSpecsXreal Air 2 ProDisplay technologySony micro-OLEDDisplay resolution1080pRefresh rateUp to 120HzMax brightness500 nitsContrast100,000:1FOV (field of view)46\\u00b0Weight75 gramsDesign, build quality\\nThe Xreal Air 2 Pro come with seemingly the same carrying case as the base model, which is good news. It's a hard shell case, it's going to protect them well during travels, and closes with a strong, reassuring snap. Zero chance of it opening on its own, nor would it be easy to crush, even if you put all of your luggage on top of it, so again \\u2013 good stuff.As for the glasses, they look identical to the Xreal Air 2 \\u2013 good, minimalist matte plastic build, soft rubber nose pads, and they're comfortably lightweight, at just 75 grams.At a distance it's hard to distinguish those from normal sunglasses, which is always welcome, but at a closer look, people will start noticing.Because of their downward-facing mini-displays, plus the mirrors that reflect them towards your eyes, the frames of these glasses sit further away from your face than is normal, which can make them look a bit odd to others around you.Now that's been the case with pretty much any \\\"wearable display\\\" glasses we've reviewed, so it's not an exclusive issue with the Xreal Air 2 Pro, just something worth pointing out.Fit, comfort and adjustability\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nXreal Air 2 Pro (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nFor the most part, these are going to feel like a slightly thicker, but fairly traditional pair of sunglasses on your face.Because they're fairly light, and come with three sizes of soft rubber nose pads to choose from, you shouldn't have any comfort issues.Even better, the Xreal Air 2 Pro have adjustable frames, which you can snap between slightly different angles. It's important to play around with that feature, because at least for me, the frames' default angle didn't let me see the virtual screen in its entirety. I changed their angle a bit, and voila.In addition, we get a prescription lens frame that attaches to the glasses, should you need it.Controls and electrochromic dimming\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nXreal Air 2 Pro physical buttons (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nThe Xreal Air 2 Pro have simple and familiar physical controls. On the bottom of the right frame, we get two buttons for setting the brightness, and a single button to adjust these glasses' most notable feature \\u2013 the electrochromic glass dimming.Press that button once, and you can see through the glasses like you would through normal sunglasses. Press it a second time, and the glasses turn significantly more opaque, letting you focus on your content better. Press it a third time, and now the glasses are at their most opaque state \\u2013 it's much harder to see through them, which makes your content pop, and look extra bright.And, of course, if you want to completely block your view through the glasses, and just enjoy your digital content, the Xreal Air 2 Pro come with an attachable, fully opaque \\\"Light Shield\\\", which you can snap over the lenses.But I doubt you'll need it, as that electrochromic glass dimming is pretty strong on its own, and I love it.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nXreal Air 2 Pro's three electrochromic dimming states (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nSwitching between just slightly dim glasses while watching YouTube and working out, so you can see your treadmill, then taking a break and quickly switching to maximum opaque, so you can block out everything else in front of you and just focus on your content, is priceless.This is indeed the kind of \\\"gimmick\\\" that I'm all for \\u2013 a very convenient feature all \\\"wearable display\\\" glasses should have.As for volume controls, or any other controls you may be asking for \\u2013 we don't get any, so you'll have to adjust your volume from your phone, or Steam Deck, or whichever other device you decide to use with these glasses.Image quality: watching movies, gaming on the Steam Deck, working on an iPad, MacBook\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nXreal Air 2 Pro connected to a Steam Deck (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nThe Xreal Air 2 Pro give you a 1080p (Full HD) virtual display that feels about 130 inches big, with a field-of-view (FOV) of 46 degrees. Those specs are exactly the same as on the base Xreal Air 2, so nothing spectacular here \\u2013 no 4K.We get the same 500 nits of brightness and up to 120Hz refresh rate also, although those specs are perfectly adequate.I've used the Xreal Air 2 Pro mostly for watching YouTube and Netflix on my phone, and gaming on my Steam Deck, and I'm very happy with the screen quality. You get a big, bright virtual screen with great colors and sharpness, and basically no latency, which is crucial for gaming.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nUsing the Xreal Air 2 Pro as a secondary screen for my iPad has been excellent (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSame with using the Xreal Air 2 Pro with my Steam Deck (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nNow, depending on which device you connect the glasses to, you can expect them to either mirror its screen (Steam Deck, iPhone / Android phones), or serve as a secondary display by default (iPad, MacBook).Using these glasses for work is an actual, realistic scenario; they've been an excellent secondary screen for my iPad. Even small text is legible, thanks to the virtual screen's fantastic clarity and sharpness.But these glasses shine extra when they're used for watching movies or YouTube videos, as it really feels like a private cinema experience you just pulled out of your pocket. If you tint them to their darkest mode, so that the outside world gets blocked and you only see the bright, big screen, all you really need beyond that is some popcorn. Great stuff!The virtual screen is absolutely fixed to your head, so you can turn around or lie comfortably on your back for a binge watch of your favorite show, and you'll always have a centered view of it.Another thing worth noting is that because the Xreal Air 2 Pro have a sensor for wearing detection, they automatically turn on when you wear them, and switch off when you take them off. In addition, your content will usually pause when you take them off; which I've noticed at least with some iPhone and Android apps.ConnectivityThere's no setup involved; as soon as you connect these glasses to your phone, laptop or Steam Deck, they'll immediately be recognized and utilized.The way you connect the Xreal Air 2 Pro to such devices is via an included USB-C cable. However, it's very important that your devices have a USB-C port with DisplayPort output, in order for this to work.Most flagship phones (but not all), most modern iPads, MacBooks, and laptops all have\\u00a0DisplayPort over USB-C support; however it's still best to do some research on your phone or device, and make sure that it does, before buying glasses like these.Notably, the Nintendo Switch doesn't have DisplayPort support from its USB-C port, so for it, you'll want to get the Xreal Beam, which allows for using HDMI connections instead. Speaking of the Xreal Beam\\u2026Xreal Beam, companion app\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Xreal Beam is optional, and sold separately (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nThose two are optional. The Xreal Beam is a sold-separately device that you can connect to your Xreal Air 2 Pro, in order to get some smart functionality and extra features out of them, such as the ability to resize or reposition your virtual screen. Check out our Xreal Beam review to learn more on that device.Personally, I really wish these glasses already came with such features included \\u2013 a built-in option to resize and reposition the virtual screen would've really made them top tier, but alas.As mentioned earlier, the Xreal Beam also allows for HDMI connectivity, besides just USB-C, which is necessary if you wish to use a Nintendo Switch with your glasses. The Beam additionally gives the glasses some smart functionality, such as running apps like Netflix without needing your phone.The Beam even has a bit of built-in storage, so you can theoretically download videos on it, and watch them on the go, without ever having to use your phone. It does need charging, though, and its battery life is about 3 hours.Another optional (and this time free) thing you may want to play around with is the Xreal companion app \\u2013 Nebula. Unfortunately it's only available on certain Android phones; no iPhone support.Besides being useful for updating your glasses, the Nebula app gives them actual AR functionality, utilizing their limited head tracking capabilities. The app features an AR launcher, a video player, web browsing with some limited multitasking capabilities, and some AR apps built specifically for the Xreal Air series.Speakers\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nXreal Air 2 Pro speaker (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nThe Xreal Air 2 Pro feature stereo speakers, one on the bottom of each frame, facing towards your ears. The sound you get is clean and spatial, and can get very loud.While it's pretty weak on the low-end side of the audio spectrum, as can be expected, it's rich on mids and highs, and with generous stereo separation.So the speaker quality is pretty fantastic for watching movies, adding extra immersion to the whole \\\"private cinema\\\" selling point of these glasses.As for whether you'll disturb others around you \\u2013 when I used the Xreal Air 2 Pro in quiet environments people could hear faint high-frequency sounds coming off of them even at fairly low volumes.So depending on where you plan on using these glasses, you may want to pair some earbuds or headphones instead of using the built-in speakers, if you want perfect privacy, and to avoid disturbing others.Verdict\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nXreal Air 2 Pro with included case and Light Shield accessory (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nThe Xreal Air 2 Pro are now my favorite \\\"wearable display\\\" glasses we've reviewed so far. The fantastic, bright and crisp virtual screen they provide, paired with a clear, wide soundstage, as well as the new electrochromic glass dimming feature, make for a truly well-rounded private cinema experience.If you're in the market for a big screen that fits in your pocket, whether you're a traveler who watches a lot of movies, a gamer on the go, or you simply wish to experiment with your productivity set up, the Xreal Air 2 Pro might just be perfect for you.However, if you're not sold on the electrochromic glass dimming feature, you can comfortably go with the more affordable Xreal Air 2, and barely consider it a compromise, if at all. Alternatively, if you actually want more features, it might be best to wait for the Xreal Air 2 Ultra.\\n\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\n Bright and sharp virtual screen\\n Super convenient electrochromic glass dimming feature\\n Loud, clear and spacious sound\\n Adjustable frame angles\\n Quality carrying case included\\n\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\n Still 1080p\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoneArena Rating:\\n\\n\\n8.9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do we rate?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWas this article helpful?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSend\\n\\n\\n\\nWe may wish to follow up.

And the best news is, you don\\u2019t have to spend $3,500 to get your hands on a good machine. Some of the best VR headsets include the Meta Quest 3 \\u2014 it\\u2019s available for a much more reasonable $500, which is a tad more digestible by our standards. Whether you want a more expansive virtual workspace or you want to give the undead a run for their money, there are some great VR headsets out there that will be useful in a variety of situations.\\nHow we test VR headsets\\nI tend to judge VR headsets on a few basic criteria: Ergonomics, immersion and controls. It\\u2019s not that hard to shove a mobile display into a plastic headset and strap some cheap elastic headbands onto it. But it takes skill to craft something that\\u2019s well balanced and doesn\\u2019t feel uncomfortable after 30 minutes.\\nMy test for ergonomics is fairly simple: How long can I wear a headset until I start to feel discomfort? For the most ergonomic devices, like the Quest 3, that could easily be an hour or two. But heavier PC hardware often feels cumbersome after just 15 minutes \\u2014 you won\\u2019t find headsets guilty of that in this guide.\\nImmersion, meanwhile, comes from having high resolution screens with fast refresh rates, so everything looks sharp and smooth. Field of view is also a major element, as it describes how well VR screens can cover what you see. Having a narrow field of view makes it feel like you\\u2019re looking through a pair of binoculars, and limits your sense of \\u201cpresence,\\u201d or the idea that you\\u2019re actually transported to a virtual world.\\nA wide field of view, on the other hand, can make it seem like you\\u2019re actually flying over the globe in Google Earth. We look at a few popular games, like Superhot, Beat Saber and Pistol Whip, on every headset to judge how immersed we feel.\\nThe best controllers fit naturally in your hands and offer accurate tracking. The industry has basically adopted the design of Meta\\u2019s excellent touch controllers, but we\\u2019re also seeing intriguing leaps forward like Valve\\u2019s finger tracking gamepads. We judge controllers based on how easy they are to hold, how they hold up to sweaty gameplay sessions and how easily headsets can track their position in space.\\nBest VR headsets for 2024\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar / Engadget\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead our full Meta Quest 3 VR headset review\\nStorage capacity: 128GB | Battery life: 2.2 hours | Field of view: 110 degrees (horizontal), 96 degrees (vertical) | Max refresh rate: 120Hz\\nThe long-awaited follow-up to the Quest 2 is an upgrade in every respect: It\\u2019s more comfortable to wear, it has higher quality screens and it has full-color mixed reality cameras, allowing you to see the real world alongside virtual elements. While it\\u2019s more expensive at $500, it\\u2019s also a far more capable headset than the Quest 2, with hardware and optics that will keep you happily immersed in VR for years.\\nThe Quest 3 is powered by Qualcomm\\u2019s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip, which Meta says has double the graphics power of the Quest 2. That additional power is noticeable in games like Red Matter 2, which feature updated textures that deliver an experience closer to PC VR. The Quest 3\\u2019s new displays run at 2,064 by 2,208 pixels per eye, offering an even better experience than the PlayStation VR2. Its mixed reality cameras also let you easily see the real world, in case you need to quickly answer a text or Slack message. And they enable games that can be built around your room.\\nWhat makes the Quest 3 interesting is that it offers more than just solid VR: It also gives you a glimpse at what a mixed reality future could be. While it\\u2019s not as sharp or capable as Apple\\u2019s Vision Pro, that\\u2019s understandable. And just like previous Quest headsets, you can also plug it into a gaming PC for higher quality VR experiences.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\nSharp new screens and lenses\\nMore compact than Quest 2\\nFaster performance\\nMixed reality cameras make it easier to see the real world\\nAdjustable for glasses\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\nMore expensive than before\\nOnly 128GB of storage to start\\nNo battery life improvements\\n\\n\\n\\n$429 at Walmart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar / Engadget\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead our full Apple Vision Pro review\\nStorage capacity: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | Battery life: 2 hours | Field of view: 100 degrees | Max refresh rate: 100Hz\\nWith the Vision Pro, Apple is attempting to do for VR what the iPod did for media players, and what the iPhone did for smartphones.

It\\u2019s a completely standalone headset, and it\\u2019s comfortable to wear for long sessions. And now that it\\u2019s down to a new standard price of $250, it remains the best way to jump into VR without spending a ton of money.\\nHere\\u2019s what\\u2019s still good, though: there\\u2019s a huge library of titles that you can experience anywhere, and it\\u2019s bundled with Meta\\u2019s great motion controllers.

It offers dual 2K OLED HDR screens, effectively giving you 4K quality. It\\u2019s one of the most comfortable headsets around. And it has some genuinely refreshing new features, like eye tracking and headset haptics. (Yes, it can literally rock your noggin.) Best of all, the PS VR2 delivers high-quality virtual reality without the need for a $1,000+ gaming PC \\u2013 all you need is a PlayStation 5.\\nNow, our recommendation comes with a few caveats. At $550, the PS VR2 is more expensive than the PS5 itself. And it\\u2019s unclear how quickly its game library will fill up. The initial run has only a few exclusives, like Horizon VR and Gran Turismo 7, and we haven\\u2019t seen many new titles since then. But it\\u2019s still the easiest way to experience high-end VR, and it\\u2019s a major upgrade over the original PS VR.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\nExcellent OLED displays\\nComfortable fit\\nHeadset haptics feel immersive\\nSense controllers are solid\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\nIncredibly high launch price\\nLimited new titles\\nLong term development is suspect\\n\\n\\n\\n$550 at Sony\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar / Engadget\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead our full Valve Index VR kit review\\nStorage capacity: N/A | Battery life: 7 hours | Field of view: 108 degrees | Max refresh rate: 120Hz\\nValve\\u2019s Index kit remains one of the best high-end solutions on the market that provides a truly immersive VR experience. For $999 you get the Index headset, Valve\\u2019s finger tracking controllers and two SteamVR base stations. While we\\u2019ve seen higher-resolution headsets arrive in the last two years, it\\u2019s still a very solid option, with a 1,440 by 1,600 pixel resolution, an eye-watering 144Hz refresh rate and a massive 130-degree field of view. I\\u2019d gladly lose a few pixels for the Index\\u2019s smoother and more expansive screen, which are still far beyond most other consumer headsets.\\nAs a SteamVR product, the Index requires installing two sensors at opposite corners of your room. And of course, it\\u2019s wired to your PC. But that clunkiness is worth it for the higher refresh rate and more accurate tracking. Sure, it\\u2019s not as easy to use as the Quest 2, but at this price range, we assume you\\u2019ll suffer a bit of inconvenience to get a truly high-quality VR experience.\\nValve\\u2019s finger tracking controllers are fantastic as well, with a convenient strap that locks them onto your hands. They make playing Half-Life: Alyx feel like a dream. It\\u2019s unfortunate that other VR games haven\\u2019t fully taken advantage of the finger tracking though.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\n144Hz refresh rate with a 130-degree field of view\\nExcellent finger-tracking controllers\\nStellar performance\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\nRequires installing sensors in your room\\nWired design\\n\\n\\n\\n$999 at Steam\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar / Engadget\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead our full Bigscreen Beyond VR headset review\\nStorage capacity: N/A | Battery life: 2 hours | Field of view: 102 degrees | Max refresh rate: 90Hz\\nEssentially an upgrade for the Index, the Beyond is a unique spin on a VR headset from Bigscreen, the developer of a popular app for watching video in VR. It looks more like an oversized pair of goggles than a massive VR headset. The $999 Beyond is the lightest VR option we\\u2019ve ever seen (it weighs a tad more than a deck of playing cards), and its Micro-OLED screens are sharp and offer near-perfect contrast. Unlike LCD screens, black can look genuinely black with the Beyond.\\nThe downside, though, is that the Bigscreen Beyond is expensive. It\\u2019s $999 on its own if you\\u2019re just upgrading a Valve Index setup. If you\\u2019re starting from scratch, though, you\\u2019ll also need to buy two Steam VR base stations and a pair of Index controllers. That adds up to a whopping $1,578.\\nThe Bigscreen Beyond also requires a custom face cushion, which is built from a 3D facescan when you place your order. Unfortunately, that makes it harder to share than other headsets. There\\u2019s also no room for glasses, since it\\u2019s so slim. You can buy prescription lens inserts from Bigscreen for an additional fee. And of course, you\\u2019ll have to live with a cable tethered to your PC, there\\u2019s none of the freedom of the cordless Meta Quest headsets.\\nFor all of its complexity, though, the Bigscreen Beyond delivers the most immersive PC VR experience I\\u2019ve ever seen. Since it\\u2019s so light, you can easily wear it for hours. Together with its glorious screens, it\\u2019s the best option for VR enthusiasts who don\\u2019t mind dealing with cost and complexity for true immersion.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\nIncredibly light and comfortable\\nSharp and bright Micro-OLED screens\\nWorks alongside existing Valve Index accessories\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\nExpensive\\nNo built-in audio\\nStill exhibits artifacting like other VR headsets\\n\\n\\n\\n$999 at Bigscreen\\n\\nOther VR headsets we\\u2019ve tested\\nMeta Quest Pro\\nAs great as the Meta Quest 3 is, the Quest 2 is still a very good entry-level VR headset, and it\\u2019s worth considering if it\\u2019s on sale below its current $250 list price. The Meta Quest Pro, on the the hand, is an expensive boondoggle best ignored.\\nHTC Vive Pro 2\\nOutside of Meta\\u2019s hardware, the HTC Vive Pro 2 remains a fantastic PC headset, but it\\u2019s far more expensive than the Valve Index, which is more comfortable and offers better audio.\\nVR headset FAQs\\nHow do VR headsets work?\\nAt the most basic level, a VR headset is simply a high quality screen that you\\u2019re holding up to your face. For a wired headset, the actual work of rendering a game is done on either a PC or game console. For completely wireless devices, like the Meta Quest 3, that work is handled right on the headset. They rely on either external sensors, or sensors built into the headsets, to map your physical space. While you can use a traditional gamepad or keyboard and mouse in VR, they typically use motion tracking controllers to immerse you in their 3D environments.\\nWhat VR headset is best for full body tracking?\\nWhile we\\u2019re still waiting for a truly great haptic VR bodysuit to arrive, you can still achieve accurate body tracking with most Steam VR-compatible PC headsets. The Valve Index and HTC Vive Pro 2 both rely on room-tracking sensors that can map your body more effectively than the built-in sensors on competitors. You can also add HTC Vive Trackers to wrist and leg straps, as well as belts, for even better coverage. The Meta Quest 3 doesn\\u2019t have any easy body tracking solutions, but you can add Vive trackers when it\\u2019s plugged into your PC to mimic a Steam VR headset.\\nOnly a few experiences, like VRChat, take advantage of full body tracking at the moment. Currently there aren\\u2019t any body tracking solutions for the PlayStation VR and VR2, but we\\u2019re intrigued by the company\\u2019s Mocopi body trackers, which were really announced in Japan.\\nWhat VR headsets are better than Oculus?\\nOculus is the previous name for Meta\\u2019s VR hardware. Currently, Meta only supports the Quest 3, Quest 2 and Quest Pro, all of which are wireless headsets. As we explain above, PC VR headsets can generally achieve better quality virtual reality, since they rely on more powerful graphics hardware.\\nWhat VR headsets work with Xbox?\\nCurrently, Microsoft\\u2019s Xbox consoles don\\u2019t support any VR headsets.\\n\\n\\nSource link \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n  \\nFacebookTwitterPinterestWhatsApp\\n\\n Previous articleEl plan de lanzamiento de Severance Season 2 para 2025 reconfirma una dura realidad sobre la transmisi\\u00f3nNext articleChina condena la declaraci\\u00f3n de la OTAN y la acusa de utilizar una \\u201cret\\u00f3rica beligerante\\u201d Yerko SilvaYerko Silva es el autor de Surprise Entertainment y Surgeradio.

IntroductionAwareness of the physical demands of exercise will often determine the strategiesused to successfully complete it. Based on a combination of prior experience, ratings ofperceived exertion (RPE), biomechanical and cardio-metabolic feedback while performingthe exercise, participants will engage in a self-pacing strategy known as teleoanticipation [1].By incorporating feedback and feed-forward mechanisms that encompass a variety of phys-iological systems, the brain will engage in selective neuromuscular regulation to ef\\ufb01cientlyand effectively complete the exercise [2]. However, predetermining an endpoint for theexercise is necessary to ensure optimal performance under the teleoanticipatory model [3].In the absence of an endpoint, physiological resources will be conserved to account forextended or intensi\\ufb01ed exercise [4,5]. Conversely, knowledge of when an endpoint isapproaching will allow this conservation to subside while subsequently increasing thework rate [6].An individual\\u2019s RPE, which primarily drives teleoanticipation, is commonly measuredusing the Borg RPE scale [7]. The Borg RPE scale ranges from \\u20186\\u2019 to \\u201820\\u2019, with each scoreAppl. Sci. 2024,14, 6072. https://doi.org/10.3390/app14146072 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppl. Sci. 2024,14, 6072 2 of 10designed to correspond to a tenfold increase in heart rate (e.g., 8 equals 80 beats/min) [8].In previous research, RPE scores have been used to drive accurate, individualized exerciseprescriptions [9]. Although RPE scores are subjective, there is a general consensus thatthese are largely attributed to the intensity of the exercise being performed [10]. This trendhas been demonstrated to be consistent with running and resistance training, as a higherRPE has been associated with higher-intensity exercise [11].Utilizing deception to manipulate an exercise experience has become increasinglycommon. Whether through the incorporation of a digital competitor [12] or hypnoticmanipulation [13], deception has demonstrated the potential to change how people perceiveexercise. Recently, visual hill gradients observed through virtual reality while cycling havebeen shown to alter perceptions of effort and breathlessness [14]. In this particular studyconducted by Finnegan et al., participants who observed a steeper hill gradient experienceda higher level of breathlessness and cycled with more power despite the resistance of thecycle ergometer remaining consistent throughout. However, a systematic review conductedby Jones et al. found that while a majority of research has investigated manipulations of theexercise endpoint, there is little research available examining the effects of exercise intensitydeception [15]. Only two studies were identi\\ufb01ed within this review that evaluated theeffects of pre-exercise intensity deception, both of which yielded no signi\\ufb01cant differencesin selected outcome measures (RPE and heart rate, respectively) [16,17]. However, Joneset al. contend that the methodologies used in these investigations varied greatly, such asthe way in which participants were deceived and differences in training experience of theparticipants. As a result, further study is required to ascertain if there is a relationshipbetween the deception of exercise intensity and exercise variables.Virtual reality (VR) has emerged as a viable tool for exercise studies involving de-ception. VR allows individuals to engage with simulated content in virtual environmentsoutside of the real world [18]. More recently, as VR technology has improved, immersivevirtual reality (IVR) has been developed to enhance the experience. IVR, unlike its predeces-sor, incorporates unique sensorimotor elements (i.e., visual, auditory, and/or tactile stimuli)that alter a user\\u2019s experience to make them feel as if what they are perceiving is their actualsurroundings [19]. From feeling a touch on the shoulder induced by a small actuator toostensibly depicted arteries and organs in a training simulation for surgeons, IVR canprovide sensations that mirror reality. In a study conducted by North and North (2016),traditional VR and IVR apparatuses depicting the sights and sounds of an airplane interiorand exterior were compared against one another [20]. Mean Likert Scale ratings of presencerevealed a stronger sense of immersion within the IVR environment compared to the tradi-tional VR environment. However, these authors noted that physiological measurementswere not used within their study and could be used to further evaluate a participant\\u2019s senseof presence. Furthermore, IVR has the unique potential to produce \\u201cplace illusion\\u201d, whichrefers to the sensation of \\u201cbeing there\\u201d in the surroundings [21]. Early study employingIVR during exercise has yielded encouraging implications, as it was found to yield lowerRPE levels while improving satisfaction during biking [22,23]. These \\ufb01ndings, while salient,highlight the need for more study employing deception tactics with IVR to determine ifthey extend to other training modalities, such as a treadmill.To our knowledge, there are no studies that have investigated the ef\\ufb01cacy of IVR inconjunction with deception strategies during treadmill exercise. This study investigatedthe performance of participants exposed to speed deception on heart rate and ratings ofperceived exertion (RPE) during immersive virtual reality while walking on a treadmill.We hypothesized that participants in the IVR condition would report lower RPE scores andequally yield lower heart rates (HRs) in comparison to the non-IVR condition.2. Materials and Methods2.1. ParticipantsSixteen college-aged healthy and physically active volunteers (aged 19\\u201323 years,eight females) were recruited from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppl. Sci. 2024,14, 6072 3 of 10campus. Exclusion criteria included the presence of any disorders that would precludemoderate- to high-intensity exercise participation and testing. All participants providedwritten informed consent at the beginning of the study. This research was approved by theUCLA Institutional Review Board and carried out in accordance with the ethical standardsof the Helsinki Declaration.2.2. Study DesignUsing a single-blinded, crossover research design, participants were tested duringtwo separate days, each consisting of three, 10 min treadmill walking trials separated by a3 min rest period, with a 24 h washout period in between each day. All participants wererandomly assigned to a participant number produced from a random number generator,which was operated by an investigator independent from recruitment and testing. Eachparticipant number corresponded to a randomized sequence of testing for the two differentdays. The order for the speeds of the treadmill (3.3 mph, 3.5 mph, and 3.7 mph) were ran-domized, as well as the order for the IVR or non-IVR trials (i.e., IVR trials occurred on eitherthe \\ufb01rst day or second day of testing). The non-IVR trials used the same treadmill albeitwith no head-mounted display (HMD). Therefore, while the non-IVR trials did not containthe same sensorimotor elements utilized with the HMD, the same speed order and testingsequence used in the IVR trials was applied for consistency. Participants were told (anddeceived) that all trials occurred at 3.5 mph for blinding purposes. While one researcherwas responsible for monitoring the participant during their rest periods in a nearby roomwithout the treadmill, the other researcher was tasked with changing the speeds based onthe assigned order. The \\ufb01rst researcher, blinded to the speeds of the treadmill and theirorder, was solely responsible for assessing the RPE and HR data to ensure that a blindedapproach was achieved. All testing was administered by trained research personnel un-der the supervision of the lab director in the UC Fit-Digital Health Exercise PhysiologyResearch Laboratory at UCLA during the early spring of 2023 for a one-month period.Study participants were asked to refrain from completing moderate\\u2013vigorous physicalactivity at least 24 h prior to beginning the study until its conclusion. For baseline measures,body mass was measured on a calibrated medical scale (accuracy \\u00b10.1 kg), and height wasdetermined using a precision stadiometer (Seca, Hanover, MD, USA;accuracy \\u00b10.01 m).Body fat percentage was measured using a validated octipolar, multi-frequency, multi-segmental bioelectrical impedance analyzer (InBody Co., Seoul, Republic of Korea) [24].The instrument measured resistance and reactance using proprietary algorithms. To ensureaccuracy, participants adhered to standard pre-measurement BIA guidelines recommendedby the American Society of Exercise Physiologists [25].2.3. IVR InterventionThe IVR intervention made use of an innovative 2.0 software application (OctonicVR, New York, NY, USA) developed to enable a variety of viewing experiences whilewalking on a treadmill. On an HMD (Meta Quest 2, Menlo Park, CA, USA), a standardized,pre-selected immersive environment portraying an island in the sky (i.e., \\u201cSky Island\\u201d) wasprojected, as shown in Figure 1. As participants walked on the treadmill, in-app musicplayed as their view dynamically changed in response to their pace and direction of gaze,as shown in Figure 2. The visual input while wearing the HMD entirely concealed theparticipants\\u2019 immediate surroundings, as is customary with IVR. However, a mixed realityfeature unique to this program permitted a real-world visual perspective of the treadmilloverlayed by the IVR environment to ensure safety while walking.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppl.

EquipmentParticipants completed both IVR and non-IVR trials on a treadmill (Redliro, New York,NY, USA) while donning a forearm-worn optical heart rate monitor (Rhythm + TM 2.0,Scosche Industries, Oxnard, CA, USA). HR data were collected and graphically displayedusing a \\ufb01tness app (iCardio\\u00ae, Cupertino, CA, USA) monitored by research administrators.2.5. Experimental ProceduresTwo independent research administrators assessed each participant individually dur-ing the 6 trials. A designated study administrator read a standardized set of instructionsprior to the start of the \\ufb01rst experiment. Participants were instructed that they would beperforming three trials, separated by three-minute rest periods, while always walking at3.5 mph on a treadmill on two different days (six trials total). One day of testing included\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppl. Sci. 2024,14, 6072 5 of 10three trials while wearing the IVR HMD, whereas the second day included three trials sansIVR. After each 10 min session, participants were asked to rate their perceived exertion(RPE) using the Borg RPE Scale, with a score ranging from 6 to 20. Furthermore, individuals\\u2019heart rates were monitored throughout every trial. After completion of the \\ufb01rst day oftesting, a 24 h washout period was given prior to the subsequent trials.Deception occurred in several ways, the \\ufb01rst of which was the treadmill\\u2019s speed. Par-ticipants were instructed that all treadmill trials would be completed at 3.5 mph. However,each day of testing included two deceptive speed conditions (3.3 and 3.7 mph) in additionto the \\u2018true\\u2019 3.5 mph speed condition. The \\u2018manual\\u2019 option in the app menu was chosenso that the HMD did not affect the treadmill speed. A separate research administratormodi\\ufb01ed the in-app display beforehand so that participants always saw a speed of 3.5 mphregardless of the deceptive pace they were actually reaching. The same research adminis-trator altered the speeds for each participant, whereas the other research administrator wasblinded to the speeds.Participants were also given false information in regard to the IVR trials. In order to\\u2018deceive\\u2019 the participants from the true aim of the study, they were informed that therewas a component of the IVR background that was changing in between trials. No furtherdetails were provided, and research administrators were not permitted to answer anyquestions pertaining to the background. After the completion of the second day of testing,participants were asked if they noticed any differences between the \\ufb01rst and second daysof testing. Responses were recorded and transcribed.2.6. Statistical AnalysisDescriptive statistics are presented as mean and standard deviation (SD). A 3\\u00d72repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized: independent variableswere treadmill speed (3 levels) and presence of IVF (2 levels), while dependent variableswere RPE and HR. Effect sizes of main effects and interactions were measured by partialeta squared (\\u03b72). These calculations were followed up by paired t-tests using the Benjamini\\u2013Hochberg procedure to maintain the familywise error rate. Effect sizes were measured byCohen\\u2019s d. Statistical signi\\ufb01cance was determined by\\u03b1= 0.05 and all tests were two-tailed.All data were exported to IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, version 22 (IBM Corp., Armonk,NY, USA) for analysis.3. Results3.1. DemographicsAll sixteen participants (mean age = 20.5\\u00b11.2 years old) successfully completed thestudy. Mean height, weight, and body fat collectively for all participants were 171\\u00b114 cm,69 \\u00b115 kg, and 19 \\u00b17.5%, respectively.3.2. RPE ScoresAlthough there was no signi\\ufb01cant difference in RPE between the 3.3 and 3.5 mphtrials within the non-IVR group, these scores were lower compared to those associatedwith the 3.7 mph trials (p= 0.002, 95% CI: (\\u22121.3,\\u22120.7), d= 0.71; p= 0.002, 95% CI: (\\u22121.4,\\u22120.5),d= 0.75, respectively). No signi\\ufb01cant differences in RPE were observed within theIVR group. During the 3.5 and 3.7 mph trials, the IVR group reported lower RPE scoresin comparison to the non-IVR group (p= 0.002, 95% CI: (0.6, 1.8), d= 1.40; p= 0.002,95% CI (1.2, 2.7), d= 1.88, respectively) (Table 1). Correlational analysis revealed a weakrelationship between RPE and HR (r = 0.27, p= 0.008). When partitioned by sex, a moderatecorrelation was found between RPE and HR in females (r = 0.45, p= 0.001), whereas a weakrelationship was identi\\ufb01ed in males (r = 0.14, p= 0.361).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppl.

Post-IVR Session ResponsesThrough an in-person post-study interview, all but one of the sixteen participantsreported \\u201cfeeling no differences in treadmill speed while wearing the HMD\\u201d between trials.However, 75% (12 participants) reported feeling \\u201ca different treadmill speed\\u201d betweentrials while not donning the HMD. Moreover, participants commonly reported that \\u201ctimewent by faster\\u201d during the IVR trials, which were also deemed to be \\u201cmore stimulating\\u201dand \\u201cmore enjoyable\\u201d.4. DiscussionIVR exercise has been linked to a variety of bene\\ufb01ts. IVR exercise has been associatedwith reductions in fatigue, stress, and depression, as well as increases in tranquility andquality of life [26]. In addition, the capacity of IVR exergaming to be physically demandingwhile enjoyable allows it to be an effective and engaging form of exercise [27]. These advan-tages, when combined with generally high satisfaction and usage scores, have revealed thepotential for IVR to vastly improve health and well-being [28]. Despite these advantages,there is a scarcity of studies testing the ef\\ufb01cacy of deception via IVR exercise across differentmodalities. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the \\ufb01rst of its kind to examine theeffects of IVR in conjunction with treadmill speed deception.The results of the present study support the \\ufb01rst of our hypotheses, as the mean RPEscores corresponding to the IVR trials were signi\\ufb01cantly lower than those from the non-IVRtrials at 3.5 and 3.7 mph (7.4 and 7.6 versus 8.6 and 9.5; p< 0.002, respectively). This \\ufb01ndingis consistent with a deceptive study using a training bike conducted by L\\u00f6chtefeld et al.,which found that the manipulation of visual and haptic cues could allow for an increasein the user\\u2019s speed by 15.2% without the user \\u2019s awareness [29]. Similarly, in regard toresistance training, both a 5% and 10% deceptive increase in loading while leg pressinghave been shown to elicit nearly identical strength measures without negatively affectingphysical self-ef\\ufb01cacy [30]. In contrast to our results, however, Leininger et al. foundno difference in RPE between exergaming and matched-intensity treadmill walking [31].An important distinction between both studies is the use of immersive VR versus two-dimensional, VR-only. Being engaged in an IVR environment may heighten dissociationand/or distract the user from the perceived effort of the exercise.The second of our hypotheses was partially supported. Only the HR response duringthe trials at 3.7 mph was lower in the IVR group than the non-IVR group (107 bpm versus115 bpm; p< 0.049, respectively). Little research has assessed heart rate trends in protocolsthat integrate deception and exergaming together, but there is a limited amount of each inisolation. In an IVR exergaming study with geriatric participants, mean HR measurements\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppl. Sci. 2024,14, 6072 7 of 10increased for three out of four individuals between two different training sessions [32].Furthermore, a comparison between four exergames found that 75% of the exergamesproduced a lower perceived exertion than actual exertion based on their average heart rateas a percentage of their maximum heart rate (66%, 78%, and 55% of maximum heart rate,respectively) [33]. Conversely, in a deceptive treadmill and cycling study, lower heart ratemeasurements were observed during the condition in which the endpoint was not speci\\ufb01edcompared to when an endpoint was predetermined [34]. Further research is warrantedto evaluate trends in HR during deceptive training in order to provide informed exerciserecommendations, such as appropriate training HR zones, for IVR exergaming users.The \\ufb01ndings of the present study may be attributed to several different factors; \\ufb01rst,the preservation of teleoanticipation. Previous research has shown that manipulatingthe endpoint can negatively affect exercise performance by disrupting the anticipatorysetting of the pace [35]. Teleoanticipatory pacing strategies are crucial to delay fatigue andoptimize performance [36]. The protocol used in this study did not modify the duration ofthe exercise nor deceive the participants of the endpoint. Hence, participants should havebeen able to fully complete the exercise without calculated or spontaneous adjustmentsaffecting the use of physiological resources in both non-IVR and IVR trials. It is possiblethat establishing a workload or endpoint may factor into attenuated RPE and HR.Furthermore, the differences in RPE and heart rate between the two conditions mayhave been a result of the IVR intervention. A commonly reported bene\\ufb01t of IVR is theability to empower one to escape negative emotions, stresses, and affairs [37]. IVR haseven been shown to reduce discomfort and minimize pain to a degree comparable toclinical analgesic treatments [38]. However, the environment in which the user is immersedalso matters. Simulated urban environments have been reported to produce feelings ofincreased fatigue and decreased levels of self-esteem, whereas nature-based environmentshave yielded decreased levels of negative emotions (i.e., fatigue, tension, depression,etc.) [39]. In the present study, the selected environment incorporated several differentnatural elements (e.g., waterfalls, rocks, beaches, unique cloud formations, etc.) into view.It is possible that this environment allowed participants to divert their attention away fromdaily stressors and the exercise they were performing. Consequently, as we showed, a fasterdeceptive speed would not be noticed by the user or re\\ufb02ected by their HR response (i.e.,autonomic nervous system). Rutkowski et al. recently demonstrated a similar phenomenonthrough heart rate variability analysis wherein lower heart rate responses during IVR wereattributed to reductions in stress levels [40]. They noted that the \\u201ccalming environment\\u201daltered autonomic nervous system activity, which was responsible for the observed heartrate behavior with virtual reality immersion.The implications of these results should serve as a guide for IVR exergaming as itcontinues to evolve. The trend of lower HR and RPE scores corresponding to exercisingwith IVR may suggest that it has the potential to lower the perceived dif\\ufb01culty of exercise,which may be particularly bene\\ufb01cial for sedentary individuals. Furthermore, the lower HRand RPE scores produced in the 3.7 mph trials may suggest that IVR may have utility as a\\u2018deceptive\\u2019 exercise intervention. None of the participants reported a conscious awarenessof the 5.7% increase in speed, nor was it re\\ufb02ected in their RPE. These results suggest thatparticipants may perform exercise at a greater intensity while using IVR. Further researchis warranted to determine if prolonged IVR training in different simulated environmentscan yield similar results. Moreover, a threshold for how much intensity (i.e., speed) can beincreased before a participant notices should also be studied.This study is not without its limitations. This study could have bene\\ufb01ted from a largersample size to add statistical power. To this end, the sample was almost entirely composedof \\ufb01t, college-aged individuals. A more diverse sample would have been ideal to improvegeneralizability. Additionally, due to the design of the protocol, the \\ufb01ndings of the presentstudy may be limited to short-term effects of IVR. Future research should be conductedto examine if these effects would be consistent over a prolonged period of time and/or inresponse to repeated exercise. Notwithstanding, several other confounding variables may\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAppl. Sci. 2024,14, 6072 8 of 10have affected the results of the present study and should be controlled in future studies.Given that walking styles and centers of gravity may vary across individuals, standardizedwalking patterns should be established in future studies to ensure that biomechanical loadsare similar. Furthermore, since the Borg RPE score is inherently a subjective measurement,it is not without its limitations and may be subject to a nonnegligible degree of variability.Alternative measures of perceived exertion should also be considered in future research.5. ConclusionsThe \\ufb01ndings of this study suggest that using deception via an immersive virtual realityexergaming experience may attenuate participant perceived effort and heart rate responsewithout the user noticing the effect.Author Contributions: Conceptualization, T.Y., T.K.S., C.A.M. and B.A.D.; methodology, T.Y., T.K.S.,C.A.M. and B.A.D.; formal analysis, T.Y., T.K.S., C.A.M., M.S.M., E.V.N. and B.A.D.; data curation, T.Y.,T.K.S., C.A.M., T.L.N., A.E.B., R.J.L., T.H.N., D.M.B. and J.P.F.; writing\\u2014original draft preparation,T.Y., T.K.S., C.A.M., M.S.M., E.V.N. and B.A.D.; writing\\u2014review and editing, T.Y., T.K.S., C.A.M.,A.E.B., R.J.L., T.H.N., D.M.B., J.P.F., M.S.M., E.V.N. and B.A.D.

PattinsonIntroduction: \\nThe sensation of breathlessness is often attributed to perturbations in cardio-pulmonary physiology, leading to changes in afferent signals. New evidence suggests that these signals are interpreted in the light of prior \\\"expectations\\\". A misalignment between afferent signals and expectations may underly unexplained breathlessness. Using a novel immersive virtual reality (VR) exercise paradigm, we investigated whether manipulating an individual's expectation of effort (determined by a virtual hill gradient) may alter their perception of breathlessness, independent from actual effort (the physical effort of cycling).\\n\\nMethods: \\nNineteen healthy volunteers completed a single experimental session where they exercised on a cycle ergometer while wearing a VR headset. We created an immersive virtual cycle ride where participants climbed up 100 m hills with virtual gradients of 4%, 6%, 8%, 10% and 12%. Each virtual hill gradient was completed twice: once with a 4% cycling ergometer resistance and once with a 6% resistance, allowing us to dissociate expected effort (virtual hill gradient) from actual effort (power). At the end of each hill, participants reported their perceived breathlessness. Linear mixed effects models were used to examine the independent contribution of actual effort and expected effort to ratings of breathlessness (0-10 scale).\\n\\nResults: \\nExpectation of effort (effect estimate \\u00b1 std. error, 0.63 \\u00b1 0.11, P < 0.001) and actual effort (0.81 \\u00b1 0.21, P < 0.001) independently explained subjective ratings of breathlessness, with comparable contributions of 19% and 18%, respectively. Additionally, we found that effort expectation accounted for 6% of participants' power and was a significant, independent predictor (0.09 \\u00b1 0.03; P = 0.001).\\n\\nConclusions: \\nAn individuals' expectation of effort is equally important for forming perceptions of breathlessness as the actual effort required to cycle. A new VR paradigm enables this to be experimentally studied and could be used to re-align breathlessness and enhance training programmes.ViewShow abstractThe Effects of Deception on Maximal Strength, Goals, and Physical Self-EfficacyArticleFull-text availableFeb 2023 Timothy Piper Steven J RadloKylie GerhardtJessica SchnaiterDeceptive feedback involves offering altered performance results to athletes with the intention of eliciting greater physical output. The use of feedback and feedforward mechanisms used to predict a performance endpoint is referred to as teleoanticipation. The interpretation of physciological and psychological effects of stimuli upon is the basis for current and future performances. The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of false positive feedback, of varying percentages, on maximal strength, physical self-efficacy, and strength goals through the lens of teleoanticipation. Recreational lifters (n=17) were tested for one repetition maximum (1RM) leg press scores, future goal weights (G), and physical self-efficacy (SE), over the course of two orientation sessions and five separate test sessions. A baseline of 1RM strength was established during the first test control session (TC). Deceptive feedback was given on the subsequent three sessions and consisted of loads that were 5% (T+5), 10% (T+10) or 15% (T+15) above the loads reported to participants during each session. The full extent of deception was revealed on the final session of testing (TF). There were significant differences between the trials for 1RM measures; TC was significantly different from the T+5, T+10, and TF. Results for G revealed significance for all trials compared to TC but no differences were found in self-esteem. This data suggests that deception may enhance 1 RM measures, negatively impact goal setting, but not affect physical self-efficacy.ViewShow abstractVirtual reality consumer experience escapes: preparing for the metaverseArticleFull-text availableMar 2022 Dai-In Danny Han Yoy Bergs Natasha MoorhouseVirtual Reality (VR) experience escapes allow individuals to spend hours on end in immersive virtual environments and interact with content in a world that is providing shelter and illusion of an alternative reality \\u2013 the metaverse. Discussions on possible risks have largely remained limited to usability challenges, while only a few studies reflect on social, psychological and physical implications this immersive technology exposes and the considerations consumers and businesses need to take. This paper critically reviews literature on escapism to discuss issues in the design and employment of virtual reality consumer experience escapes. Key issues relating to VR experience escapes and resulting effects on consumer health and well-being are discussed, emphasizing needed consumer-centered research and design. Future considerations include (1) Self-indulgent escapism through VR consumer experiences, (2) Ethical considerations in the design of VR consumer experience escapes, and (3) Purposeful design of VR consumer experiences escapes. A sequential research agenda is presented that integrates antecedents of VR experience escapes that connect to three main future research streams; designing purpose-driven VR consumer experience escapes, complementing methodologies for VR consumer experience research, and meaningful VR consumer experience escapes.ViewShow abstractImmersive Virtual Reality Influences Physiologic Responses to Submaximal Exercise: A Randomized, Crossover TrialArticleFull-text availableSep 2021 Sebastian Rutkowski Patryk Szary Jerzy Sacha Richard CasaburiObjectives: This cross-sectional, randomly assigned study aimed to assess the influence of immersive virtual reality (VR) on exercise tolerance expressed as the duration of a submaximal exercise test (ET) on a cycle ergometer.\\nMethods: The study enrolled 70 healthy volunteers aged 22\\u201325years. Each participant performed an ET with and without VR. Time- and frequency-domain heart rate variability (HRV) parameters were analyzed for the first 3min (T1), the last 3min (T2), and the time at which the shorter of the two tests terminated (Tiso). In the time domain, a SD of R\\u2013R intervals (SDNN) and a root mean square of successive R\\u2013R interval differences (RMSSD) in milliseconds were computed. The following spectral components were considered: low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), total power (TP), and LF/HF ratio. The study was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04197024).\\nResults: Compared to standard ET, tests in immersive VR lasted significantly longer (694 vs. 591s, p<0.00001) and were associated with lower HR response across the range of corresponding exercise levels, averaging 5\\u20138 beats/min. In the multiple regression analysis, the ET duration was positively determined by male sex, immersion in VR, and negatively determined by HRT1 and RMSSDT1.\\nConclusion: Exercising in VR is associated with lower HR which allowed subjects to exercise for a longer time before reaching target heart rate (HR). In addition, the increase in exercise duration was found to be related to an adjustment in autonomic nervous activity at a given work rate favoring parasympathetic predominance.ViewShow abstractImmersive Virtual Reality Exergame Promotes the Practice of Physical Activity in Older People: An Opportunity during COVID-19ArticleFull-text availableSep 2021 Pablo Campo-Prieto Gustavo Rodr\\u00edguez-Fuentes J. M. Cancela CarralLife expectancy has increased in recent years. Physical activity has been postulated as a key element in active aging strategies. However, adherence to physical exercise programs has traditionally been low among the elderly, and the current situation of the COVID-19 pandemic has added extra impediments. Immersive virtual reality (IVR) devices could motivate this population to practice exercise. This study aimed to analyse the use of IVR exergames as a tool to facilitate physical exercise in older people. Four healthy older adults (males, 65\\u201377 years) participated in the study. They carried out two exergaming sessions with HTC Vive ProTM. Outcomes were evaluated using the Simulator Sickness Questionnaire (SSQ), System Usability Scale (SUS), Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ post-game module), an ad hoc satisfaction questionnaire, and perceived effort. All participants completed the sessions without adverse effects, with no SSQ symptoms reported. SUS scores were high in both sessions (SUS > 85/100). Post-game GEQ scores were 3.08\\u20133.41/4 (positive experiences) and 0.08\\u20130.16/4 (negative experiences). Opinions showed high levels of satisfaction with the experience. Exergaming programs, based on commercial head-mounted displays, are a feasible alternative to traditional senior exercise, and could be a solution to the current situation that has arisen from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.ViewShow abstractEffect of Immersive Virtual Reality Exergaming on University Students\\u2019 Anxiety, Depression, and Perceived Stress: A Pilot Study (Preprint)ArticleFull-text availableApr 2021 Wenge Xu Hai-Ning Liang Nilufar Baghaei Shaoyue WenBackground\\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in the number of students with depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. A solution that has been increasingly used for improving health and well-being is exergaming. The effects and acceptability of exergames have been studied widely but mostly with older adults. The feasibility and usability of exergames among university students, especially those of immersive virtual reality (iVR) exergames, remain unexplored.\\n\\nObjective\\nThis study aimed to explore the feasibility of a 6-week iVR exergame\\u2013based intervention in reducing anxiety, depression, and perceived stress among university students and to examine the usability and acceptability of such games.\\n\\nMethods\\nA total of 31 university students were recruited to participate in a 6-week study in which they needed to play a boxing-style iVR exergame called FitXR (FitXR Limited) twice per week (30 minutes per session). Their anxiety (Beck Anxiety Inventory), depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), and perceived stress (Perceived Stress Scale) levels were measured before and after intervention.\\n\\nResults\\nA total of 15 participants completed the 6-week study. Our results suggested that participants\\u2019 mean depression scores decreased significantly from 8.33 (SD 5.98) to 5.40 (SD 5.14) after the intervention (P=.01). In addition, most participants (14/15, 93%) believed that the iVR exergame has good usability. Furthermore, most participants (14/15, 93%) were satisfied with the iVR gameplay experience and would play the iVR exergame again in the future. Of the 15 participants, 11 (73%) would recommend the iVR exergame to their friends.\\n\\nConclusions\\nThe results gained from this study show that the iVR exergame has good usability, is highly acceptable, and has the potential to reduce depression levels among university students.ViewShow abstractThe Effectiveness of Virtual Reality Exercise on Individual's Physiological, Psychological and Rehabilitative Outcomes: A Systematic ReviewArticleFull-text availableJun 2020Int J Environ Res Publ Health Jiali Qian Daniel J. McDonough Zan GaoObjective purpose: This review synthesized the literature examining the effects of virtual reality (VR)-based exercise on physiological, psychological, and rehabilitative outcomes in various populations. Design: A systematic review. Data sources: 246 articles were retrieved using key words, such as \\\"VR\\\", \\\"exercise intervention\\\", \\\"physiological\\\", \\\"psychology\\\", and \\\"rehabilitation\\\" through nine databases including Academic Search Premier and PubMed. Eligibility criteria for selecting studies: 15 articles which met the following criteria were included in the review: (1) peer-reviewed; (2) published in English; (3) randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled trials or causal-comparative design; (4) interventions using VR devices; and (5) examined effects on physiological, psychological, and/or rehabilitative outcomes. Descriptive and thematic analyses were used. Results: Of the 12 articles examining physiological outcomes, eight showed a positive effect on physical fitness, muscle strength, balance, and extremity function. Only four articles examined the effects on psychological outcomes, three showed positive effects such that VR exercise could ease fatigue, tension, and depression and induce calmness and enhance quality of life. Nine articles investigated the effects of VR-based exercise on rehabilitative outcomes with physiological and/or psychological outcomes, and six observed significant positive changes. In detail, patients who suffered from chronic stroke, hemodialysis, spinal-cord injury, cerebral palsy in early ages, and cognitive decline usually saw better improvements using VR-based exercise. Conclusion: The findings suggest that VR exercise has the potential to exert a positive impact on individual's physiological, psychological, and rehabilitative outcomes compared with traditional exercise. However, the quality, quantity, and sample size of existing studies are far from ideal. Therefore, more rigorous studies are needed to confirm the observed positive effects.ViewShow abstractAcute Effect of Virtual Reality Exercise Bike Games on College Students' Physiological and Psychological OutcomesArticleFull-text availableJul 2017 Nan Zeng Zachary Clark Pope Zan GaoCommercially available virtual reality (VR) exercise systems are extensively used in many health domains among clinical populations. However, evidence regarding the efficacy of this technology on healthy adults' health-related outcomes is unknown. This pilot study compared physiological and psychological responses following exercise on a VR-based exercise bike (VirZoom) and traditional stationary exercise bike. Twelve healthy college students (9 females; Mage = 25.01, SD = \\u00b1 4.74; MBMI = 22.84, SD = \\u00b1 3.68) completed two separate 20-minute exercise sessions on the VR-based exercise bike and traditional stationary exercise bike. Blood pressure (BP), ratings of perceived exertion, self-efficacy, and enjoyment were assessed as primary outcomes. Dependent t-tests indicated no significant differences in mean systolic or diastolic BP changes from pre to postexercise between the VR-based exercise and traditional stationary biking sessions (all p > 0.05). Notably, participants reported significantly higher ratings of perceived exertion (p < 0.05, Cohen's d = 0.68) during the traditional exercise biking session compared with VR-based exercise biking session. However, participants had significantly higher self-efficacy (p < 0.05, Cohen's d =-0.83) and enjoyment (p < 0.05, Cohen's d =-0.89) during the VR-based exercise biking session compared with traditional stationary biking. The commercially available VR-based exercise bike (VirZoom) may be considered an effective, enjoyable, and motivating physical activity tool. Further interventions with larger and more diverse samples and examinations of more health-related outcomes are warranted to determine optimal application of VR-based exercise programming among various populations.ViewShow abstractThe Effect of Virtual Reality Forest and Urban Environments on Physiological and Psychological ResponsesArticleAug 2018 Chia-Pin YuHsiao-Yun LeeXiang-Yi LuoPrevious studies used pictures or movies to investigate the impact of virtual nature environments on physiological and psychological health, providing inferior immersive experiences. The latest virtual reality (VR), launched in 2016, allows users to be fully immersed in simulated surroundings. However, the effects of the simulated environments created by the latest VR technology on health were not yet known. This study employed both cross-over and pretest-posttest design to examine the influence of forest and urban VR environments on restoration (N = 30). Both physiological and psychological responses were collected. The results show that participants\\u2019 systolic blood pressure and heart rate decreased with time, regardless of environmental differences. About psychological responses, an increased level of fatigue and a decreased level of self-esteem were reported in simulated urban environments. In contrast, an increased level of vigor and a decreased level of negative emotions (i.e., confusion, fatigue, anger-hostility, tension, and depression) were observed in simulated forest environments. In sum, greater benefits were found when immersing in forest settings. The latest VR technology can serve as an alternative way to access nature environments for restoration.ViewShow abstractThe Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) scaleArticleJul 2017Nerys WilliamsViewShow moreRecommended publicationsDiscover morePreprintA Teleoanticipatory Approach to the Deceptive Modulation of Treadmill Walking Speed using Immersive...February 2024Trent YamamotoTrinabh K. SahniCorinne A McCabe[...] Brett A DolezalBACKGROUND\\nThe influence of exercise deception and immersive virtual reality on ratings of perceived exertion and heart rate during exercise have been studied in isolation, but rarely in tandem.

[Show full abstract] imperative.\\n\\nOBJECTIVE\\nThis study investigated the influence of speed deception on heart rate and ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) during immersive virtual reality (IVR) while walking on a treadmill.\\n\\nMETHODS\\nUsing a double-blinded, crossover research design, sixteen college-aged adults (eight females) were randomly assigned a testing order for a total of six, ten-minute trials of treadmill walking; three trials conducted with IVR on one day and three non-IVR trials (i.e. control) on another day at 3.3, 3.5, and 3.7 mph. A 24 hour washout period was given in between the first and second day of testing. Participants were told that all trials occurred at 3.5 mph. Borg RPE scores were assessed after each trial while HR was monitored throughout.\\n\\nRESULTS\\nThe IVR trials produced lower mean RPE scores in comparison to the non-IVR trials during 3.5 and 3.7 mph (p = 0.002, 95% CI: (0.6, 1.8); p = 0.002, 95% CI (1.2, 2.7), respectively). The IVR trials also yielded a lower mean HR compared to the non-IVR trials at the highest speed of 3.7 mph (p = 0.049, 95% CI: (2.0, 12.7)). Within group differences for the non-IVR group were identified in RPE for the 3.3 and 3.5 mph trials compared to those at 3.7 mph (p = 0.002, 95% CI: (-1.4, -0.5); p = 0.002, 95% CI: (-1.4, -0.5), respectively). No differences were detected within the IVR group.\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThese findings suggest that using deception via an immersive virtual reality exergaming experience may affect attenuated participant perceived effort and heart rate response without the user noticing the effect.Read moreArticleFull-text availableField-based fitness measures improve via an immersive virtual reality exergaming platform: a randomi...March 2024 \\u00b7 Frontiers in Virtual RealityTrent Yamamoto Brett A Dolezal Mitchell S.

This study aimed to assess changes in field-based fitness tests ... [Show full abstract] including the 1-mile run, 20-m dash, multiple single-leg hop-stabilization test, Abalakov jump, and 5-10-5 Pro Agility test during a 1-month workout protocol and to compare differences between groups assigned to either an IVR machine-directed exergaming platform or a traditional, self-directed cable-resistance training control (SELF). Eighteen (7 females) college-aged participants with little resistance training experience were randomized to IVR or SELF and worked out thrice weekly for 4 weeks (12 sessions). Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were performed for continuous variables to assess significance. Compared to SELF, the IVR group had significantly better performance improvements in 20 m dash (\\u22120.1s vs. 0.0s, p = 0.022), 5-10-5 Pro Agility Test (\\u22120.1s vs. \\u22120.0s, p = 0.003), Abalakov Jump (5.8 cm vs. 2.0 cm, p = 0.0013), 1-Mile Run (\\u221211.0s vs. \\u22122.0s, p = 0.008), and Multiple Single-Leg Hop-Stabilization Test with their dominant (\\u22129.0s vs. 1.0s, p = 0.0015) and non-dominant (\\u22128.0s vs. 1.0s, p = 0.003) legs. This training study demonstrates that IVR exergaming, more so than those that traditionally resistance train (SELF), can improve many field-based fitness components including agility, balance and stability, speed/acceleration, cardiovascular endurance, and lower-body power.View full-textArticleFull-text availableEffects of a portable, cable-based concentric-only resistance machine on muscular strength in untrai...March 2024 \\u00b7 Scientific Journal of Sport and PerformanceTrent Yamamoto Brett A DolezalAndrew C.

[Show full abstract] weekly to complete a 12-week training program. Participants were blinded and randomly allocated 1:1 to an intervention group (n = 16, wherein the resistance training used the concentric-only machine (CRT)) or a control group (n = 16, wherein the resistance training was completed using traditional concentric-eccentric with a conventional cable-based machine (CON)). While both groups improved in 1-RM chest press and squat press performance, there was no significant difference between groups. These findings suggest that the use of a portable CRT machine may confer similar strength benefits in comparison to traditional concentric-eccentric training. It is possible that the lack of the eccentric component with the CRT machine enables for a higher training volume to be completed, which consequently results in strength benefits.View full-textChapterFull-text availableLumaPath: An Immersive Virtual Reality Game for Encouraging Physical Activity for Senior Arthritis P...June 2019 Xin Tong Diane GromalaFederico MachucaArthritis occurs typically in the senior populations which involves stiff and painful joints.

Meanwhile, we conducted a pilot study with five senior arthritis patients to evaluate their experience and assess LumaPath, and twenty-three healthy participants among which there are three senior participants. Overall, the study results showed that LumaPath had great potential as a gamified tool to motivate senior adults to stay physically active. Furthermore, we discovered that patients\\u2019 limited physical movement and RoM, and the age were significant factors affecting their gaming experience, interactions and how to execute certain physical movements.View full-textLast Updated: 16 Jul 2024Discover the world's researchJoin ResearchGate to find the people and research you need to help your work.Join for free ResearchGate iOS AppGet it from the App Store now.InstallKeep up with your stats and moreAccess scientific knowledge from anywhere orDiscover by subject areaRecruit researchersJoin for freeLoginEmail Tip: Most researchers use their institutional email address as their ResearchGate loginPasswordForgot password?

Even smartphones display content through an LCD screen. Holograms, on the other hand, project objects into mid-air instead of on a screen. These holograms often appear in movies depicting near-future technology, like Marvel's \\\"Iron Man\\\". In these films, hand gestures in the air move and interact with holograms. In reality, holograms use light reflection and refraction, making it difficult to fully implement them in mid-air.\\nMarketon is a startup researching and developing devices that can project holograms in mid-air, even in bright environments. Unlike augmented reality (AR) or virtual reality (VR) which require separate display devices (HMDs), Marketon's technology displays a monitor screen visible to the naked eye in mid-air.\\nMarketon calls this \\\"hovering hologram\\\". Just as smartphones are operated by touch gestures, hovering holograms can be controlled by touching the air. IT Chosun met with Yang Chang-jun, CEO of Marketon, to discuss the motivation behind developing hovering holograms and their vision.\\n\\n\\nYang Chang-jun, CEO of Marketon / IT Chosun\\n\\n\\n\\nStarted as Contactless Display During COVID-19 Pandemic\\n\\nYang Chang-jun founded Marketon in October 2019. He explains that Marketon's initial business direction was not to create hovering hologram devices as it is now. Initially, given Yang's 20 years of experience at the Korea Association for ICT Promotion, Marketon planned to focus on related services and consulting. The turning point in Marketon's business direction was the COVID-19 pandemic that began in early 2020.\\nYang said, \\\"In early 2020, there were rumors about COVID-19 infections from elevators in the Gasan Digital Complex area. Since everyone was wearing masks, people thought elevator buttons were the medium of infection. I thought we could solve this with IT technology. So we created a contactless device where pressing a virtual button floating in the air would be like pressing the actual elevator button.\\\"\\nThis contactless elevator button device evolved into the hovering hologram that Marketon is currently developing. The key feature of the hovering hologram is that it doesn't require a separate display device. It projects light reflected from a mirror into mid-air through special glass. A sensor that recognizes hand position is added to enable touch operation. From the side, it looks like gesturing in the air, but from the front, it appears as if you're touching and operating an actual screen.\\n\\n\\nDemonstrating the Marketon hovering hologram device. / IT Chosun\\n\\n\\n\\nHologram Display Overcoming AR/VR Limitations\\n\\nThis also addresses the device penetration problem, which is considered a barrier to AR/VR popularization. For example, VR device developers like Apple, Meta (Oculus), HTC VIVE, and VR content creators are trying to expand the ecosystem.\\nHowever, VR devices worn on the head can be heavy or need to be connected to charging cables, making it difficult to fully enjoy virtual spaces. VR device prices are also as high as a high-spec PC or more. They're expensive and inconvenient. In contrast, hovering holograms can be operated by hand gestures on a screen floating in mid-air. Without wearing any separate VR equipment, operations like surgical simulations are possible with the naked eye.\\nYang emphasizes that Marketon's hovering hologram is the technology closest to digital holograms. Holograms are divided into analog and digital holograms. Analog holograms typically refer to technology that shows different images depending on the viewing angle. They are mainly used in toys or souvenirs like lenticular prints.\\nOn the other hand, digital holograms are the technology seen in SF creations like Iron Man or Star Wars. Realistically, it's still a technology in the research stage that hasn't been commercialized yet. Current holograms include pyramid holograms that project light into a closed space like a box, propeller holograms that split light using propellers, and theater-style holograms that project light in dark spaces. All three are fixed holograms that are difficult to interact with.\\nYang confidently states, \\\"Marketon's hovering hologram can be seen with the naked eye without any additional devices and can be interacted with by hand. I believe Marketon's hovering hologram technology is the closest to digital hologram technology.\\\"\\n\\n\\nRunning an anatomical practice simulation in a classroom with Marketon's hovering hologram device installed.\\u00a0/ Marketon\\n\\n\\n\\nGoal: Develop Mobile Hologram Device Within 4 Years\\n\\nMarketon's hovering hologram devices are currently being adopted in museums and exhibitions. Instead of docents or signposts explaining exhibits, visitors can directly rotate and view 3D modeled exhibits through the hovering hologram. Yang explains that anything that can be seen on a computer can be output as a hovering hologram.\\nYang plans to pursue slimming down the hovering hologram device and expanding its applications in the future. Currently, Marketon's device is thick due to the mirror angle. This is analyzed to be similar to the process of CRT monitors for PCs and CRT TVs, which had large backs, becoming thin like current LCD monitors or OLED TVs.\\nIn fact, Marketon's devices are pursuing slimming in a similar way. If slimming is achieved, it would be possible to place Marketon's device on top of a smartphone screen and operate the smartphone screen as a hologram floating in the air.\\nExpanding the applications of hovering holograms is also linked to discovering Marketon's revenue structure. Hovering holograms are interesting but not essential technology. The same scenes can be viewed with existing display devices.\\nTherefore, Marketon's hovering holograms are currently mainly used as devices to provide special experiences in event spaces like museums or exhibitions. Marketon is researching ways to expand applications, along with lightening and slimming, to find out where and how hovering holograms can be used in various ways.\\nYang says, \\\"Hovering holograms, when viewed from the side, don't show properly, like a monitor with a privacy film attached, but can be seen with the naked eye without any medium to output the screen. It can also play roles like hand recognition double security devices as seen in movies, so it can be widely used not only in museums and schools but also in places like finance.\\\"\\nHe added, \\\"By incorporating AI, we can create digital humans that answer various questions from different angles, and if we implement mobile hologram devices, holographic video calls or meetings would be possible. Our goal is to continuously reduce the thickness of the device and develop a mobile hologram device that generates holograms on smartphones within 4 years.\\\"\\ninho@\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\uae30\\uc790\\uc758 \\uc804\\uccb4\\uae30\\uc0ac\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\uc800\\uc791\\uad8c\\uc790 \\u00a9 IT\\uc870\\uc120 \\ubb34\\ub2e8\\uc804\\uc7ac \\ubc0f \\uc7ac\\ubc30\\ud3ec \\uae08\\uc9c0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\uac1c\\uc758 \\ub313\\uae00\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ud68c\\uc6d0\\ub85c\\uadf8\\uc778\\n\\n\\ub313\\uae00 \\ub0b4\\uc6a9\\uc785\\ub825\\n\\n\\n\\n0 / 400\\n\\ub4f1\\ub85d\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ub313\\uae00 \\uc815\\ub82c\\n\\n\\ucd5c\\uc2e0\\uc21c\\n\\ucd94\\ucc9c\\uc21c\\n\\ub2f5\\uae00\\uc21c\\n\\n\\n BEST\\ub313\\uae00\\n\\nBEST \\ub313\\uae00\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ub2f5\\uae00\\uacfc \\ucd94\\ucc9c\\uc218\\ub97c \\ud569\\uc0b0\\ud558\\uc5ec \\uc790\\ub3d9\\uc73c\\ub85c \\ub178\\ucd9c\\ub429\\ub2c8\\ub2e4.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ub2eb\\uae30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ub354\\ubcf4\\uae30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ub313\\uae00\\uc0ad\\uc81c\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\uc0ad\\uc81c\\ud55c \\ub313\\uae00\\uc740 \\ub2e4\\uc2dc \\ubcf5\\uad6c\\ud560 \\uc218 \\uc5c6\\uc2b5\\ub2c8\\ub2e4.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\uadf8\\ub798\\ub3c4 \\uc0ad\\uc81c\\ud558\\uc2dc\\uaca0\\uc2b5\\ub2c8\\uae4c?\\r\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ube44\\ubc00\\ubc88\\ud638\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\uc0ad\\uc81c\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ub2eb\\uae30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ub313\\uae00\\uc218\\uc815\\n\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ub313\\uae00 \\uc218\\uc815\\uc740 \\uc791\\uc131 \\ud6c4 1\\ubd84\\ub0b4\\uc5d0\\ub9cc \\uac00\\ub2a5\\ud569\\ub2c8\\ub2e4.\\r\\n\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ubcf8\\ubb38\\n\\n / 400\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ube44\\ubc00\\ubc88\\ud638\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\uc218\\uc815\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ub2eb\\uae30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ub0b4 \\ub313\\uae00 \\ubaa8\\uc74c\\n\\ub2eb\\uae30\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ub9ce\\uc774 \\ubcf8 \\ub274\\uc2a4\\n\\n\\n\\n1\\n\\u201cSK\\ud558\\uc774\\ub2c9\\uc2a4 \\uc131\\uacfc\\uae09 \\uc5bc\\ub9cc\\ub370?\\u201d\\u2026\\uc0bc\\uc131\\uc804\\uc790, \\uacbd\\uc7c1\\uc0ac 150% \\uc9c0\\uae09\\uc124\\uc5d0 '\\uc220\\ub801'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2\\nSK\\uc628, \\uce90\\uc998\\uc5d0 \\uc778\\ub825\\ub09c '\\uc774\\uc911\\uace0'\\u2026\\uc791\\ub144 \\ud574\\uc678\\uc0ac\\uc5c5\\uc7a5\\uc11c 6000\\uba85 \\ud1f4\\uc0ac\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n3\\n\\\"\\ucc57GPT\\ubcf4\\ub2e4 \\ub611\\ub611\\ud558\\ub124\\\" \\ub85c\\ud1a1 AI\\ube44\\uc11c '\\uc288\\ud37c\\ub85c\\uc774\\uc5b4' \\uc368\\ubcf4\\ub2c8\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n4\\n\\u201c\\uc0c1\\uc6a9\\ucc28 \\uc2dc\\uc7a5 \\uc911\\uad6d\\uc5d0 \\ube8f\\uae38\\ub77c\\u201d \\u2026\\ud604\\ub300\\ucc28, \\uc218\\uc18c \\uc0dd\\ud0dc\\uacc4 \\uad6c\\ucd95 \\ub098\\uc11c\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n5\\n\\\"\\uace0\\ub9d9\\ub2e4, \\ud37c\\uc2a4\\ud2b8 \\ub514\\uc13c\\ub358\\ud2b8\\\"\\u2026\\ub125\\uc2a8 \\uc5f0\\ub9e4\\ucd9c 4\\uc870\\uc2dc\\ub300 \\ub208\\uc55e\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ub4f1\\ub85d\\ubc88\\ud638 : \\uc11c\\uc6b8 \\uc544 00936\\n\\ub4f1\\ub85d\\uc77c : 2009-08-17\\n\\ubc1c\\ud589\\uc77c : 2009-08-17\\n\\ubc1c\\ud589\\u00b7\\ud3b8\\uc9d1\\uc778 : \\uae40\\uc885\\ud638\\n\\uc81c\\ud638 : IT\\uc870\\uc120\\n\\uc0ac\\uc5c5\\uc790\\ubc88\\ud638 : 117-81-77714\\n\\uc8fc\\uc18c : \\uc11c\\uc6b8\\ud2b9\\ubcc4\\uc2dc \\uc911\\uad6c \\uc138\\uc885\\ub300\\ub85c 135 , 912\\ud638(\\ud0dc\\ud3c9\\ub85c1\\uac00)\\n\\ub300\\ud45c\\uc804\\ud654 : 070-4285-0546\\n\\ud329\\uc2a4 : 070-4285-0547\\n\\uccad\\uc18c\\ub144\\ubcf4\\ud638\\ucc45\\uc784\\uc790 : \\ubc15\\uc815\\uc2dd\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 IT\\uc870\\uc120.

         Credit: OMNIVISION\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntended for eye and face tracking in AR/VR/MR consumer headsets and glasses it is the first time that OMNIVISION has brought its patented DCG high dynamic range (HDR) technology to the AR/VR/MR market in the 2.2-micron (\\u00b5m) pixel OG0TC GS image sensor.\\nWith a package size of just 1.64mm x 1.64mm, the device is an ultra-small and low-power image sensor that\\u2019s intended for optimising primarily inward-facing tracking cameras. This small form factor is key to industrial designs as multiple cameras are required for tracking all aspects of the face (eyes, brows, lips, etc.). The OG0TC is pin-to-pin compatible with OMNIVISION\\u2019s previous-generation BSI GS image sensor for easy upgrades.\\n\\u201cUltra-low power consumption is critical for AR/VR battery-powered devices, and our OG0TC BSI GS image sensor reduces power by more than 40% over our previous-generation OG0TB sensor, which is already an extremely low-power device,\\u201d said Devang Patel, marketing director \\u2013 IoT/Emerging, OMNIVISION. \\u201cPin-to-pin compatibility makes the upgrade to the OG0TC easy for our customers, so they do not need to make any change to their design to save power and enjoy new features like DCG technology.\\u201d\\nKey features of the OG0TC image sensor include:\\n\\u00b7\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The sensor is built on OMNIVISION\\u2019s PureCel Plus-S stacked-die technology.\\n\\u00b7\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 It features OMNIVISION\\u2019s patented DCG HDR technology and offers 400x400 resolution with a 2.2\\u00b5m pixel in a 1/14.46-inch optical format.\\n\\u00b7\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 Nyxel technology enables the best quantum efficiency at the 940nm near-infrared (NIR) wavelength for sharp, accurate images of moving objects.\\n\\u00b7\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 It consumes less than 40% of the power at 30 frames per second (fps) compared with the previous-generation sensor.\\n\\u00b7\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 The sensor\\u2019s high modulation transfer function enables sharper images with greater contrast and more detail.\\n\\u00b7\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0\\u00a0 It supports a flexible interface, including MIPI with multi-drop, CPHY, etc.\\nPatel added, \\u201cWe are excited to introduce our single-exposure DCG HDR technology for ghost-free image capture to the AR/VR market.

With a near-eye device, virtual information can be projected onto real-world objects, creating an interactive experience. This technology can be used for entertainment, but it can also enhance learning and manufacturing processes.Although the AR field has gained immense traction, mass production of AR waveguides \\u2014 the core light-transmitting components in AR devices \\u2014 has been difficult. To overcome high costs and fabrication challenges, Sun et al. designed a novel approach for manufacturing optical waveguides.Using a cost-effective LCD 3D printer, the team fabricated components of a geometric AR waveguide, bonding 3 dielectric reflectors and other printed components with UV resin. Their modifications to the printing process significantly improved surface roughness without the need for molding, dicing, and post-polishing, thereby reducing labor costs while maintaining image quality.\\u201cThe intricate nature of traditional AR fabrication techniques and their high precision requirements for optical characteristics have become significant barriers to overcoming the cost of mass production,\\u201d said author Ranjith Unnithan. \\u201cThe success of our prototype suggests potential for widespread application and commercialization.\\u201dThe authors plan to continue improving AR device functionality by exploring advanced materials and printing techniques. They also look forward to seeing a wider application of 3D-printed optics.\\u201cOur future projects involve refining the 3D printing process to enhance waveguide performance and durability,\\u201d said author Dechuan Sun.\\u201cFor others in the field, investigating new applications of 3D-printed optics in various technological domains could be a promising avenue,\\u201d said author Younger Liang.Source: \\u201cAdditive 3D printed optical waveguide for augmented reality,\\u201d by Dechuan Sun, Gregory Tanyi, Alan Lee, Chris French, Younger Liang, Christina Lim, and Ranjith R Unnithan, APL Photonics (2024).

Artwork lines the walls of the lobby while themed suites captivate guests.\\n\\n\\nEach year, the hotel hosts an artist in residence, showcasing works from local artists. Leah Smithson, an L.A.-based multidisciplinary artist, is 2024\\u2019s featured creative. Her work has been displayed globally and she is part of of NEW INC, NEW MUSEUM\\u2019s incubator for art, design, and technology.\\n\\nSmithson\\u2019s exhibit at Hotel Figueroa is titled Limitless and celebrates the \\u201calchemy of invention.\\u201d A fully interactive experience, exhibit includes traditional paintings and an exclusive Augmented Reality sculpture \\u2014 a first for the hotel. Visitors and guests can interact with the immersive one-of-a-kind AR sculpture through their smartphones, tablets, and the new Apple Vision Pro, to launch a visual ASMR effect that tells the story of Smithson\\u2019s work.\\n\\n\\n\\u201cI explore the human condition using portraits that mirror an emotional state or frame of mind, rather than the likeness of a person. This work examines complex and emotional subjects objectively, leveraging both traditional\\u2014painting, ceramic sculpture\\u2014and new media\\u20143D animation, XR, architectural projection installation,\\u201d explained Smithson in a press release. \\u201cMy recent works incorporate images of avatars. Avatars, often generic in nature, transcend individual differences, so my recent works employ avatars as a tool to offer a glimpse into the collective human experience of love and loss. They remind us that even in the vastness of the world we live in, we are not alone.\\u201d\\n\\nTaking inspiration from the hotel\\u2019s rich history and honoring female innovators, Smithson worked with various materials to ensure an impactful exhibit. Foe example, for some of her paintings, she looked at the historical link between textiles and innovation and utilized canvas crafted from biodynamic cotton. This method reflected cotton breeder Sally Fox\\u2019s cultivation of naturally colored, organically grown cotton plants.\\nMORE FOR YOU\\u2018The Acolyte\\u2019 Episode 8 Recap And Review: A Dreadful Season Finale And The Cameos Can\\u2019t Save ItAmazon Prime Day 2024: Our Deals Editors Found The 100 Best Discounts So FarApple Warns Millions Of iPhone Users\\u2014Stop Using Google ChromeChimera by Leah Smithson.Leah Smithson\\n\\nRanging in size and shape from 22\\u201d x 25\\u201d to 52\\u201d x 64\\u201d, select pieces of Smithson\\u2019s works are available to the public for purchase.

Graphic courtesy Epitone, Inc.\\nCARLSBAD \\u2013 As Artificial Intelligence continues to change the way we drive cars \\u2013 or how cars will be driving us \\u2013 the windshields of our cars are also clearly changing.\\nNext-generation cars have been shifting to offer myriad new options that make driving safer and more intuitive, and Epitone, Inc., a top developer of automotive augmented reality (AR) solutions with a flagship product called LiveWindow, is leading part of that movement.\\nEpitone focuses on developing comprehensive solutions through software, hardware and optical technology that merge mobility and AR platforms, targeting the future automotive market, seeking to better drive safety and driver focus.\\nSungHoon HongCEOEpitone, Inc.\\nWith $30 million collectively raised through Series A and Series B1 fundraisers since launching in Incheon, South Korea in 2021, and a new factory in Tijuana with 10 employees \\u2013 and preparing soon to expand its workforce \\u2013 Epitone is moving quickly to create the car windshields of the future now, with front car glass features never before seen.\\nEpitone\\u2019s design, development and testing has been ongoing with global automotive companies since its early development stages, and the company is currently in discussions with a major automaker to build LiveWindow into their vehicles, Epitone CEO SungHoon Hong.\\nEpitone is transforming cars and SUVs into \\u201csmart cars\\u201d that integrate AR technologies with advanced driver-assistance systems, where the entire windshield becomes part in-car app and IT device offering high-definition graphics, real-time information, and where the entire road turns into a canvas, Hong said.\\nLiveWindow uses translucent digital imagery projected across the entire length of the windshield as the vehicle\\u2019s primary display and integrates vehicle sensory information through onboard software and applications.\\nIt also integrates music controls, phone calls and vehicle diagnostics, and puts them into the driver\\u2019s field of view instead of the driver having to look away from the road. It creates a distributed AI network offering automated communication for sharing sensor data, great for optimizing routes, safety coordination and even behavior predictions.\\nThe New Shift (or Lack Thereof)\\nDrivers in cars on the road today often shift their gaze between various displays on their car dashboard or glance around at their smart phones, both of which can be hazardous.\\nIn a very different and safer experience, LiveWindow, compact and easily installable in any automobile, uses the front window to arrange content on the road, warn of hazards and more.\\nThrough AR and \\u201csmart\\u201d features, Epitone\\u2019s windshields become an entire display of information about what\\u2019s up ahead on the road and what the driver\\u2019s patterns are, complete with 3D graphics.\\nIn addition to displays in the front of the car, Epitone incorporates cameras and sensors near the driver\\u2019s seat, installs a computing box on the other side of the vehicle and has Global Positioning System for navigation in the rear. This connection collects information and shares it through the display on the windshield.\\nIt detects driver-overlooked dangers by collecting essential data, including driver information, road conditions and vehicle data, with a network of front/driver view cameras and sensors for assessing vehicle localization, graphical rendering and eye tracking.\\nEpitone Chief Creative Officer Junki Park said the company is already a disruptive force in the industry.\\nJunki ParkChief Creative OfficerEpitone, Inc.\\n\\u201cWe are not just a technical company,\\u201d Park said. \\u201cI think Epitone is a little bit of the troublemaker in the automotive industry, and this is our ambition now. Others have made just devices, but we have the approach to change the entire car to a smart car with hardware and the whole ecosystem \\u2026 similar to what happened with the smartphone.\\u201d\\nPark and Hong say there are no true competitors in the industry able to be in all of the spaces Epitone is \\u2013 with sensors, displays, methodology, computing and AI all under its umbrella.\\n\\u201cEpitone is the only company optimizing all these components together, from methodology to display to computing,\\u201d Hong said. \\u201cWe are 40 employees but all 40 are experts at what they do.\\u201d\\nLiveWindow\\u2019s Time Coming Soon\\nFortune Business Insights reports that the global automotive windshield market size was valued at $29.74 billion in 2023. Research Nester reports that the automotive glass market size is expected to reach $40 billion by the end of 2036, growing at a CAGR of 6% from 2024-2036.\\nThe growth is due to increased technological advancements in the automotive industry, including autonomous mobility and electrification and Data Bridge Market Research said there is currently a high investment in research and development activities for the manufacturing of advanced windshields to satisfy government regulations as well as growing consumer demand.\\nThe company reports that the investment banking industry estimates Epitone\\u2019s valuation to be approaching $200 million.\\nWithin four years, says Hong said we\\u2019ll be seeing the Epitone windshields in vehicles. Prototypes of the windshields are already being tested in a few cars in San Diego County, though not available to the public.\\nHong has been in San Diego since 1999 but left from 2016 to 2021 to serve as vice president in the AR technology development division at Samsung Electronics Advanced Technology Institute in Korea. While at Samsung, Hong led the development and business implementation of 3D augmented reality head-up display, and holographic AR glasses, related devices software and system at Samsung.\\nAfter initially launching Epitone in South Korea with Samsung behind it, Hong moved back to Southern California. He established a corporation in San Diego to target the global market.\\nEpitone\\u2019s local offices started on Nobel Drive, recently moved to Carlsbad, and now includes a mass production pilot line in Tijuana.\\nThe company is currently in the middle of a Series B2 seeking to raise $3 million from investors.\\nHong said later this month the company expected to disclose more information about one of the \\u201cbiggest automakers in Europe\\u201d that is getting behind the company and LiveWindow but said he could not disclose the name right now.\\nHe said that Epitone is currently undergoing quality certification to supply AR head-up displays (HUD) for the company, which he said is ready to make a strategic investment in Epitone.\\nAn initial $20 million Series A investment came from Hyosung Group and its subsidiary Shinwha Intertek for producing the core optical modules back in 2021 and 2022. Epitone\\u2019s Series B1 fundraising came via a $10 million investment from SoluM for the overall production of the LiveWindow display boxes.\\nSoluM has a business model that produces vehicle displays, equips them with Epitone\\u2019s HUD solution, and supplies them to original equipment manufacturers.\\nThe AR HUD developed by Epitone utilizes the entire front display of the vehicle to implement AR that shows the vehicle\\u2019s speed, location, and gap to the left, right and front car in real time. Risk factors across the road are also provided in 3D AR, with. Smart Film, an optical film for 3D AR from Shinhwa, is expected to be installed as part of LiveWindow.\\nEpitone, Inc.\\nOPENED: 2021\\nCEO: SungHoon Hong\\nHEADQUARTERS: Carlsbad, Incheon, South Korea and factory in Tijuana\\nBUSINESS: Software Development/Computer Systems Design\\nEMPLOYEES: 40\\nFUNDING: Company has raised $30 million in Series A and Series B1 round combined; currently in Series B2 funding\\nWEBSITE: epitone.ai\\nCONTACT: info@epitone.ai\\nSOCIAL IMPACT: Last month, Epitone\\u2019s LiveWindow won the 2024 iF DESIGN AWARD in the User Experience category\\nNOTABLE: CEO Hong was VP at Samsung Electronics in Korea from 2016-2021\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare\\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinEmailPrint\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrevious articleVR Entertainment Businesses Take Hold in San DiegoNext articleFrom Burger Biz to Baby Biz\\n\\nDonald Bloodworth\\n\\n-Advertisement-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatured Articles\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nProperty Management\\nVerde Property Services Growing Exponentially\\n\\n\\nRay Huard -  July 16, 2024 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSoftware\\nAutonomous Aircraft Specialists to Join Forces\\n\\n\\nBRAD GRAVES -  July 16, 2024 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nHealthcare\\nCuriosity Led to Creating Ambulance Company\\n\\n\\nRay Huard -  July 16, 2024 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-Advertisement-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-Advertisement-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Articles\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nProperty Management\\nVerde Property Services Growing Exponentially\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSoftware\\nAutonomous Aircraft Specialists to Join Forces\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nHealthcare\\nCuriosity Led to Creating Ambulance Company\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSDBJ INSIDER\\nSDBJ Insider\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTechnology\\nQualcomm Stakes Its Claim in PCs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-Advertisement-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-Advertisement-\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n-Advertisement-\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebookInstagramLinkedinTwitterYoutube\\n\\nTHE COMMUNITY OF BUSINESS\\u2122 \\n\\n4909 Murphy Canyon Rd., Suite 200\\nSan Diego, CA 92123\\n858-277-6359  (Local)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBrowse MoreSDBJ Marketplace\\nSDBJ Book of Lists\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLearn MoreAbout San Diego Business Journal\\nEditorial Calendar\\nSDBJ Staff\\nContact Us\\nAdvertise with Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nServicesJoin Our Membership\\nNewsletter Sign-Up\\nReset Your Password\\nForgot Your password\\nRenewals\\nEvent Calendar\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther JournalsLos Angeles Business Journal\\nOrange County Business Journal\\nSan Fernando Valley Business Journal\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrivacy Policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a9 San Diego Business Journal | Website by Web Publisher PRO \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n        \"type\": \"Document\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"lc\": 1,\n      \"type\": \"constructor\",\n      \"id\": [\n        \"langchain\",\n        \"schema\",\n        \"document\",\n        \"Document\"\n      ],\n      \"kwargs\": {\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"source\": \"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/designiums-collaboration-with-8th-wall-on-full-display-at-awe-usa-2024-302197040.html\",\n          \"title\": \"Designium's Collaboration with 8th Wall on Full Display at AWE USA 2024\",\n          \"description\": \"/PRNewswire/ -- Designium has made a significant impact at AWE USA 2024 with the innovative release at 8th Wall that promises to revolutionize the way users...\",\n          \"language\": \"en\"\n        },\n        \"page_content\": \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDesignium's Collaboration with 8th Wall on Full Display at AWE USA 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nResources\\n\\n\\nBlog\\n \\nJournalists\\n\\n\\n\\nLog In\\n \\nSign Up\\n \\nData Privacy\\n \\nSend a Release\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNews\\n\\n\\nProducts\\n\\n\\nContact\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch\\nWhen typing in this field, a list of search results will appear and be automatically updated as you type.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearching for your content...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo results found.

Credit: Rain Technology.\\n\\nUS-based Rain Technology has accumulated more than two decades of experience in consumer display technologies, with ventures into LCD, OLED, e-privacy, and automotive fields. The company's latest addition to its portfolio, the Anamorphic-XR (AR/VR), is promoting wider adoption of AR/VR by addressing some of the most notable issues in contemporary devices, such as their display brightness, field of view, and color fidelity.In an interview with DIGITIMES Asia, CEO Robert Ramsey and Head of Sales and Marketing Paul Treichler shared insights into Rain's journey from 3D cinema displays to consumer applications, including partnerships with major tech companies such as Lenovo for e-privacy solutions. The company is now in talks with industry leaders such as Magic Leap, Apple, and Meta to integrate its technologies into their AR/VR devices.Rain Technology's roots trace back to RealD, where the team developed display technologies for 3D cinema. In 2017, they spun off as RealD ME, focusing on consumer applications and advanced directional displays. The company rebranded as Rain Technology in 2021 and now operates globally with offices in Taiwan, Colorado, and the UK.Pioneering e-privacy through display technologyOne of the first consumer applications of Rain technology is its e-privacy solution, achieved through its displays. They developed a technology that goes inside the backlight system of LCDs capable of directing very small light beams precisely to a user's eye.In practice, it allows users to activate a privacy mode if they don't wish the content on their displays to be seen by bystanders. \\\"\\u2026 you drive it at a particular voltage, and it blocks all the higher angles and axis angles where people cannot see it, so only the head-on user can see it,\\\" said Ramsey. It can also turn back to a standard LCD once privacy mode is turned off, which Rain calls \\\"share mode\\\". This technology and its subsequent iterations were licensed to Lenovo and HP and utilized in their laptops.Entering the AR/VR marketThe transition to AR and VR was a natural progression for Rain Technology. Drawing from their experience in auto-stereoscopic 3D displays, which allows users to see 3D without glasses by controlling a light field display to toggle images to the user's left and right eyes, the team recognized that this technology can be utilized in AR/VR applications. \\\"We started noticing in the market that there were a couple of things that really bogged down the AR sector, such as brightness, color fidelity, and field of view,\\\" Ramsey noted.As consumers of AR/VR, both Ramsey and Treichler mentioned that their experience is often hindered by comfort and the content not being compelling enough. Ramsey believed that a major part of the issue was the display drop-off. \\\"Companies like Apple have made displays so good, and then you put on an AR headset and see this 8-bit dinosaur walking across you \\u2026 it's a step backward,\\\" he explained.Rain Technology has already spent several years working on a technology that could lend itself to AR/VR applications. After identifying the market, they went into development mode for about three and a half years and published their Anamorphic-XR technology about a year ago. Ramsey believes that their technology can help address current issues with AR/VR and even achieve the \\\"holy grail\\\" of the AR landscape, where a displayed image can be seamlessly placed into the real world.Technological Innovations for AR/VRThe advantages of Rain's Anamorphic-XR technology are twofold. On one hand, the imaging system doesn't magnify the image, which means there's no image distortion, and brightness is conserved. On the other hand, it doesn't compress the image due to the way the technology extracts the image, similarly avoiding distortion.They also mentioned that Anamorphic-XR fits particularly well with the same form factor of glasses, thus making it perfect for devices such as AR glasses. A standard pair of glasses has lens frames and side frames that go over the wearer's ears. Typically, a projector is tucked into the side frame to inject imagery into the lenses, by which the image is extracted to the user's eyes. However, because the image source is directed from a single point (the frame), it has to be expanded in both x and y dimensions, leading to distorted images.Rain's solution involves filling the entire top side of the frame with a display and injecting it down into the lenses. By doing so, the display only has to extend the imagery in one (downward) direction rather than downwards and sideways.While the major improvements in brightness and color aren't yet causing waves, the display impressively avoids the need to magnify light and alter the fundamental physics. Furthermore, the downward dimension is highly related to the field of view. By having a horizontal display across the entire frame, it is in a perfect position to offer users a much wider field of view compared to existing devices.Treichler highlighted that for consumers, the increased brightness and reduced need to refocus (since there's only one dimension to consider) will improve AR/VR comfort, enhance highlight visibility, and achieve a broader dynamic range, resulting in a better overall experience. On the manufacturing side, this solution \\\"doesn't use any exotic materials or processes,\\\" thus simplifying production.Future directionsBesides AR/VR, Rain Technology is also excited to explore several new sectors. In particular, Rain is developing its technology to work on micro LED and even nano LED displays, in line with its vision to add to the displays from major display manufacturers such as BOE and AUO.Treichler added that he is particularly excited about bringing their e-privacy solutions to OLED and consequently, smartphones. Smartphone privacy is currently achieved by adding a piece of glass or plastic on top of the display, even on $1,500 \\\"premium\\\" models. Moreover, once the piece is added on, the device is permanently stuck in privacy mode.Rain Technology's solution allows users to be able to freely switch between private or share mode, without having to stick an extra piece of material on their phone's display. Last but not least, automotive displays are also a field of interest, with applications such as preventing driver distractions.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated storiesNASA uses AR to improve spacecraft assembly efficiencyGiantplus starts production of flexible OTFTs, marking a breakthrough in the fieldThree reasons behind SDC and LGD's decision to slow down their Micro LED businessHow VR and AR technologies are transforming gaming experienceApple's Vision Pro delay casts doubt on OLEDoS futureTargeting AR device market, Samsung Display unveils LEDoS development processShow moreCategoriesDisplays + photonics Display system IT + CE IT components, peripherals Tags3D AR/VR display LCD technology \\n\\nShare this article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther links\\n\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBIZ FOCUSJul 15, 10:35How cryptocurrency technology can enhance financial servicesMonday 15 July 2024Crypto Quantique partners with silicon IP distributors across Asia to deliver quantum-driven chip securityThursday 11 July 2024TechInsights: Americas' chip suppliers continue to dominate R&D spendingFriday 28 June 2024Why should busy professionals use AI for their passport size photo editing?TOP STORIES7 DAYS NEWSChinese brands dominate smartphone and TV markets via dual circulation strategyTaiwan fab toolmakers grab major orders from TSMC and ChinaIndian startup and semiconductor titans team up to bridge skill gapMediaTek to surpass Qualcomm Snapdragon in 5G smartphone marketAI server shipments to surge in 2H24 as GPU shortage easesSamsung latest LPDDR5 DRAM validated for use with Dimensity 9400China's counter-intuitive semiconductor exports surge goes unnoticedHuawei reveals operational hardship from US sanctions, expresses confidence in recoveryNvidia plans new China-specific AI and gaming GPUsTSMC joins HBM4 arena with 5nm base chip production for memory giantsFull list\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin our mailing list\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDIGITIMES\\n\\nAbout\\nAdvertising\\nMembership\\nTerms & conditions\\nPrivacy policy\\nCopyright policy\\nContact us\\nNotes & corrections\\nSite map\\n\\u4e2d\\u6587\\u7db2\\u7e41\\u9ad4\\n\\u4e2d\\u6587\\u7f51\\u7b80\\u4f53\\n\\n\\n\\nTOOLS & SERVICES\\n\\nTomorrow's Headlines\\n7 days news\\nWeb news elsewhere\\nTopics\\nRSS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a9\\u00a02024 DIGITIMES Inc.

While some frames cater to open-ear audio or AI assistance, AR smart glasses like the VITURE (pronounced \\u201cvihh-chure\\u201d) Pro XR act like portable monitors \\u2014 capable of projecting a large virtual display perfect for gaming or watching TV and movies.There\\u2019s plenty of AR glasses competition from brands like Rokid, XREAL, and RayNeo. However, VITURE\\u2019s combination of quality hardware and easy-to-use software has typically seen the brand labeled as the most well-rounded offering on the market \\u2014 although that does come hand-in-hand with being one of the more expensive options available. Do the company's latest Pro XR smart glasses continue to impress? Let\\u2019s find out.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: DesignWhile smart glasses can come in a range of designs, with the Solos AirGo 3 particularly excelling when it comes to frame diversity, most AR/XR smart glasses attempt to style themselves on the classic Wayfarer style \\u2014 though this look is only authentically available with the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.However, VITURE has captured the essence of Ray-Ban\\u2019s iconic frames pretty well while making obvious adjustments to house the tech within. These glasses very much feel like they might be the Wayfarers of tomorrow. Chunkier temples feature open-ear stereo speakers and an action button and volume rocker on the underside of the left arm.VITURE's Pro XR Glasses are styled like a gently futuristic redesign of Ray-Ban's iconic Wayfarer sunglasses. They're a little chunky in places, and fall victim to the same \\\"floating off your face\\\" look that other AR glasses do, however, they remain comfortable even over long spans and don't look half bad when worn. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)A similar increase in bulk is found across the top of the frames, which is needed to make room for each eye\\u2019s bottom-firing micro-OLED display projections \\u2013 and sadly maintains the quirky \\u201clifting off the face\\u201d look that many AR glasses suffer from. These projections land on secondary, prism-like lenses found behind the main electrochromic film lenses, which can be activated with a single press of the action button to block out up to 99.5% of external light and enhance immersion while in use.The prism-like secondary lenses may take some getting used to at first, and while there\\u2019s a clear visual definition between the two, it can be jarring. Eventually, your eyes tune out their presence \\u2014 though their surface is much more reflective than the main lenses. This can manifest some distracting mirroring in brighter environments while the glasses aren\\u2019t in use or the display is anchored to the corner of your sight.Unlike other AR glasses that require sometimes costly lens inserts for vision adjustment, VITURE's Pro XR glasses include twin myopia adjustment dials to ensure you can see the virtual displays with crystal clarity without your regular prescription lenses. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)Two myopia adjustment dials, also present on the chunkier front frames, aid those with nearsightedness. These dials allow you to fine-tune the focus for each eye (0.0D to -5.0D) and ensure you\\u2019re getting the most crisp results possible from the virtual displays.Finally, these lightweight (77 grams) frames feature a proprietary magnetic pin connection at the end of the right temple tip, which allows hassle-free connection to the glasses\\u2019 USB Type-C data cable, which connects to your device of choice.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: SetupIf you want to use VITURE Pro XR glasses with home or handheld consoles like the PS5, Nintendo Switch, Asus ROG Ally, or Steam Deck, you\\u2019ll need to invest in the VITURE Pro Mobile Dock.Using the glasses themselves is simple. Connecting the aforementioned USB Type-C cable to the right temple tip and any compatible device (Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, featuring a USB-C DisplayPort/DP Alt Mode-supporting port) instantly activates screen mirroring as the glasses\\u2019 micro-OLED projectors kick in.You don\\u2019t need to worry about drivers or software with this use case. The VITURE Pro XR smart glasses essentially act as a plug-and-play monitor. However, this will only result in a static virtual display with little to no customization available for positioning the screen or engaging in 3DoF (Three Degrees of Freedom), AR-like interactions.The VITURE Mobile Dock allows you to unleash the true potential of your handheld console/gaming PC by presenting the same large-picture virtual displays and providing 13,000 mAh of additional charge to your device. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)If you want to use VITURE Pro XR glasses with home or handheld consoles like the PS5, Nintendo Switch, Asus ROG Ally, or Steam Deck, you\\u2019ll need to invest in the VITURE Pro Mobile Dock ($129). This accessory unlocks 3D content support and acts as a docking station (that allows two VITURE smart glasses to be connected simultaneously and HDMI connections) and a portable power bank with a 13,000 mAh battery.\\u00a0VITURE Pro XR Glasses: SoftwareTo use those more advanced visual features, you\\u2019ll need to download and install the SpaceWalker app. SpaceWalker is available for iOS/iPadOS, Android, and now Windows, giving users a spatial sandbox that includes a web browser and media player. While that doesn\\u2019t sound like much, it is enough to be able to make use of web versions of apps like YouTube, Netflix, and Prime Video.The benefit of doing this through SpaceWalker is that VITURE\\u2019s app also allows for 3DoF tracking, allowing you to turn away from your virtual screen or more comfortably view content. SpaceWalker also allows media or web pages to be clipped to the corners of your view and scaled in size to suit your needs.This can let you prepare and cook a meal while following along with a video tutorial that doesn\\u2019t impede your full vision, or catch up on some YouTube videos while getting around town without worrying about bowling over the locals because your entire field of vision was being taken up with \\u201cMemes for the Boys part 62.\\u201dSpaceWalker for Windows and macOS unlocks a more familiar spatial computing experience, where the Pro XR's headtracking is put to use to add an extra dimension to your virtual displays with full 3DoF rendering. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)SpaceWalker for macOS is a whole other ballgame. Here, you\\u2019ll be able to engage in a much truer spatial computing experience. Connecting the VITURE smart glasses to a MacBook running SpaceWalker unlocks a multitude of virtual display options, including stunning ultrawide 21:9 floating displays and the ability to shrink and grow the scale of displays with ease.The Windows version of SpaceWalker has only recently been released and can be a little buggy at times. However, it\\u2019s safe to expect that VITURE will bring the app up to speed in the coming months.There\\u2019s no current rival to VITURE\\u2019s offerings on the software front, at least not from smart glasses manufacturers themselves (though there are some excellent pieces of third-party software available online). While XREAL has the most similar offering in terms of design, style, picture, and audio, VITURE is one of the only AR smart glasses companies to deliver such compelling, widely-supported, easy-to-use, and impactful software.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: DisplayAR glasses like VITURE\\u2019s use an interesting projection method to present virtual screens before your eyes. Rather than the image appearing directly on the lens, two Sony micro-OLED panels beam an image into a secondary lens that redirects each image toward your eyes.The result is quite impressive, to say the least. With a bright, 135-inch virtual panel before you at all times. There\\u2019s a full-HD (1920 x 1080) per-eye resolution to enjoy with refresh rates of up to 120Hz \\u2014 which is especially excellent for speedy, responsive gaming through the glasses.The Pro XR's twin lenses can be hard to adjust to at first, vision through the glasses won't ever be 100% comfortable when you're not making use of the micro-OLED displays, but it's by no means impossible to acclimatize to. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)One downside to the AR glasses form factor is that your FoV (Field of View) is more restricted than when using a VR/AR headset like the Meta Quest 3. The Pro XR glasses have a narrower 46-degree FoV, resulting in a more tightly packed area from which you can view the projected image. In contrast, the Quest 3\\u2019s pancake lenses offer a much larger 110-degree FoV, offering over twice the screen space with which to enjoy content.Pictures are bright and crisp, and whether I was watching movies or playing games, I never felt the glasses lacking in visual quality or performance. Better still, watching 3D content on the glasses is absolutely stunning and simple to perform. Simply holding down the action button on the left temple switches to SBS (Side-by-Side) vision, allowing the full 3D experience in games and media.Capturing the virtual displays through the lenses is a tricky task, and this picture by no means does the unwarped, crisp, and clear presentation of the virtual screens any justice. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)The VITURE Pro XR smart glasses are excellent for gaming. They deliver speedy refresh rates and capture the striking and varied colors of CD Projekt Red\\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077. The enormous virtual display pulls you further into titles, and your immersion is peaked when you enable the electrochromic lenses that block out the surrounding light almost entirely.\\u00a0VITURE Pro XR Glasses: AudioThe VITURE Pro XR\\u2019s audio's open-ear design lets you enjoy media or games without shutting off the rest of the world. The Harmon-tuned audio is definitely rich in quality, and the audio bleed is very well-contained.Setting the glasses down while playing a range of music videos and movies at peak volume, I lost track of much of the audio at only a few feet in distance. This makes them ideal for commutes or on-the-go watching, as you won\\u2019t be annoying those around you by unwantedly blaring the contents of your watchlist in their general direction.The open-ear speakers housed within the Pro XR's temples offer excellent audio, though they do fall short against other AR glasses when it comes to maximum volume. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)However, that\\u2019s likely because the VITURE Pro XR\\u2019s speakers are relatively quiet compared to others. The XREAL Air 2 glasses are also open-ear in design but offer much more of a kick, making them better suited for noisier or less isolated environments. This does, however, negatively impact the frames when it comes to audio bleed.All in all, the Pro XR\\u2019s speakers strike a fair balance and are more than enjoyable while at home or in less bustling locations. For those who want to dial things up to 11, there\\u2019s always the option to switch over to a pair of Bluetooth earbuds or headphones.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: Price and availabilityThe VITURE Pro XR smart glasses are available for $549, though currently discounted to $459 for early adopters.At face value, that\\u2019s a sizeable sum for a pair of high-tech shades, though it\\u2019s not an uncommon price for smart glasses of its ilk. The $399 XREAL Air 2 AR glasses offer similar features, but options like the VITURE Pro XR\\u2019s electrochromic film lenses are reserved for the more expensive $449 Air 2 Pro model.VITURE's Pro XR Glasses (front) are a step up from XREAL's Air 2 AR glasses (rear), offering an electrochromic panel that can be activated to blank out all but the brightest of lights and greatly improve immersion. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)However, XREAL\\u2019s offerings lack the myopia adjustment dials of VITURE\\u2019s glasses, leaving some glasses wearers needing to rely on potentially expensive lens inserts to see the virtual displays clearly.Of course, at that price, it\\u2019s worth considering the expanded functions and capabilities of VR/AR headsets like the $499 Meta Quest 3. That being said, the improvements to the overall AR experience from the Quest 3 will come at the cost of a bulkier, heavier, and less welcoming form factor.\\u00a0Bottom lineVITURE\\u2019s AR smart glasses offering is a well-rounded assortment of accessories and software that pushes the AR/XR experience that frames like this can deliver. There\\u2019s truly no smoother or fleshed-out experience as the one offered here \\u2014 at least for now.Forget spatial computing. Pick up a pair of VITURE's Pro XR glasses and give facial computing a try instead.My only major gripe is that the complete experience is costly. VITURE\\u2019s frames alone have an intimidating price tag to some, so having to invest even more to get the most from your handheld or home console may be asking too much of general consumers.However, as a plug-and-play pair of AR smart glasses, the core product is still considerably impressive, thanks to the awesome SpaceWalker software available across mobile and desktop platforms.Yes, the AR experience is a little more expansive and impressive through the lenses of a VR/AR headset. However, they're far less accommodating when it comes to comfort or wearing while out and about. As such, unless you're looking to take advantage of VR/AR gaming, forget spatial computing. Pick up a pair of VITURE's Pro XR glasses and give facial computing a try instead.More from Laptop MagWhat are smart glasses?

It is great for watching movies, viewing 3D videos, and using as a display for a Mac, but some people have struggled to find a day-to-day use for the device.\\nAt over 1.3 pounds, the Vision Pro is heavy and fatigue can set in quickly. There are two bands options, but for some, it is hard to wear the headset for long periods of time. There is also an external battery pack to contend with, and the headset is not easy to travel with, especially with Apple's dedicated Travel Case. \\nThe Vision Pro is undoubtedly Apple's most technically advanced product and an incredible feat of engineering that is impressive when it is first viewed, but those considering a purchase should try it at the Apple Store and do a lot of research on what can be done with it before making a purchase. The Vision Pro is excellent for watching movies and consuming content, plus it can be used as a display for a Mac, but it has a limited number of apps and games.\\nIt will be at least a year before Apple comes out with a new version of the Vision Pro, and rumors suggest that the next Vision Pro will be cheaper with lower-end components. Based on the rumors that work on a second-generation model has been temporarily suspended this is a good time to buy the headset. \\n\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro\\n\\n\\nContents\\n\\nShould You Buy the Vision Pro?Apple Vision ProHow to BuyWhat's in the BoxVision Pro ReviewsIssuesHow It WorksDesignDisplayLens InsertsCameras and SensorsNavigationOptic ID3D CameraAudioConnectivityProcessors and RAMStorage SpaceBattery LifevisionOSMac IntegrationVision Pro How TosMedical WarningsWhat's Next for Vision ProSoftwareSmart Glasses?Apple's Long Term AR/VR PlansApple's Health TestingApple Vision Pro Timeline\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a major new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, and the device launched on February 2, 2024.\\nWhile the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world. Apple refers to the Vision Pro as the first spatial computing device.\\nApple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on the world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements. \\nFor a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \\\"real\\\" and the \\\"immersive\\\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown. \\nDesign wise, Apple Vision Pro is not unlike a pair of ski goggles, featuring a singular piece of laminated glass for the front that melds into an aluminum alloy frame. A soft, fitted Light Seal attaches magnetically to the frame and conforms to your face to block out light. \\nTwo Audio Straps with built-in speakers are positioned at the sides of the headset, delivering Spatial Audio that blends what you're hearing on the headset with what's going on in the real world. The Audio Straps connect to a 3D knitted headband that holds the Vision Pro in place. Apple designed it to be breathable, cushiony, and stretchy for comfort, and a Fit Dial ensures the headset fits tight against your head. There's also a dual-strap design that evenly distributes the weight between the back and top of the head. Apple plans to offer Light Seals and headbands in multiple sizes, and these components are swappable. \\nInside the frame, there are two micro-OLED displays that deliver over 4K resolution to each eye for a total of 23 million pixels. There's also an external display called EyeSight that projects an image of your eyes so people can tell whether you're using the headset in an immersive mode or if you can see what's going on around you. For glasses wearers, there are custom prescription Zeiss Optical Inserts that can be attached magnetically to the headset's lenses.\\nThere are no controllers for Apple Vision Pro, with the headset instead controlled by eye tracking, hand gestures, and voice commands. An app can be navigated to and highlighted by looking at it and then opened with a tap of the fingers. Scrolling is done with a simple flick of the fingers. \\nMore than a dozen cameras and sensors in Apple Vision Pro map out the world around you, keeping track of your hand and eye movements. Optic ID, which scans your iris with infrared lights and cameras, is used for authentication. Each person has a unique iris pattern, and Optic ID is akin to Face ID and Touch ID. It can be used for unlocking the device, making purchases, and as a password replacement. \\nThere are two Apple silicon chips inside Vision Pro, including the same M2 chip that's in the Mac and a new R1 chip. The M2 chip runs visionOS, executes computer vision algorithms, and provides graphics, while the R1 chip processes input from the cameras, sensors, and microphones. \\nApple Vision Pro can take 3D photos and videos using a built-in camera that's powered by tapping on the top button of the device. Apple says that users can capture videos and photos in 3D and then relive those memories like never before. Vision Pro shows existing photos and videos in large scale, making them more immersive, and with visionOS 2, there is an option to convert 2D photos to 3D photos using depth information. Note that when you are recording video, Vision Pro makes it clear that recording is happening with an animation on the external display.\\nplaySubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.\\nDue to weight constraints, Apple did not put a battery in Apple Vision Pro. Instead, it can be powered by a braided cable that is attached to a battery pack worn at the hip or plugged into an adapter. The battery pack offers up to 2.5 hours of battery life on a single charge. \\n\\nWith Apple Vision Pro, content is displayed in the space around you. You can position apps and windows in mid-air, rearranging them as you see fit, with multiple windows supported. Apple says there's an \\\"infinite canvas\\\" to work with. Apps can be displayed in the actual environment that you're in so you can stay present with what's going on around you, or you can use a more immersive view that shuts out the world and puts content on a virtual background called an Environment.\\nA visionOS operating system runs on Apple Vision Pro, and it has a dedicated App Store with apps designed specifically for the device, but it is also able to run iPhone and iPad apps. You can connect the Vision Pro to a Mac, with the headset serving as a display for the Mac. It works with Bluetooth accessories for text input and control, or you can use virtual typing or dictation for text. \\nThere is a main Home View that has all of your favorite Apple apps like Mail, Messages, Music, Safari, Photos, and more, with your data synced through iCloud. The interface is similar to the iPhone interface, but you can open apps and arrange them virtually. Apple is updating its main apps for visionOS and has created APIs for developers, plus Apple is providing Vision Pro test kits to developers for app testing. Apple Vision Pro offers an immersive experience for entertainment like TV and movies, and the Apple TV app has more than 150 3D titles. Content can be expanded to feel like it's in your own personal theater, complete with spatial audio.\\nFaceTime has been redesigned for Vision Pro. People on the call are shown in large tiles to the headset wearer, while the headset wearer is shown as an accurate digital recreation using their Digital Persona. With FaceTime, Vision Pro users can collaborate on documents with colleagues or share apps with others, and spatial audio makes it clear who is speaking.\\nThe Cinema Environment allows you to watch shows and movies at the frame rate and aspect ratio chosen by the creator, or you can use a nature-themed Environment to make the screen feel 100 feet wide. Apple created Apple Immersive Videos that are 180-degree 3D 8K recordings that put users right inside the action, plus streaming services like Apple TV+ and Disney+ are available on Vision Pro. As for gaming, Vision Pro supports Apple Arcade, with 100 iPad games to be available at launch. Games can be played with Bluetooth game controllers that connect to the headset. \\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback?

Apple is providing demonstrations in all of its Apple retail locations, and while there was initially high demand, retail locations are seeing fewer requests for demos.\\nPricing starts at $3,500 for 256GB of storage space. The ordering process requires a Face ID scan to help customers determine the correct Light Seal and head band fit. Zeiss reading lenses for the Vision Pro cost an additional $99, while custom prescription lens inserts are priced at $149. A valid unexpired prescription from a U.S. eye care professional needs to be uploaded after purchase in order to get custom prescription lens inserts.\\nIn June 2024, Apple expanded Vision Pro availability to China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore, and in July, it launched in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the UK in July.\\nWhat's in the Box\\nThe Vision Pro ships with two bands, the Solo Knit Band and the Dual Loop Band. It also comes with a Light Seal, two Light Seal Cushions in different sizes, an Apple Vision Pro Cover for when the headset is not in use, a Polishing Cloth, a battery, a USB-C charging cable, and a USB-C power adapter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVision Pro Reviews\\n\\nVision Pro reviews are mixed overall. For the most part, reviewers have been impressed with the hardware and the technology introduced by the Vision Pro, but there are questions about the actual function of the device, the intuitiveness of the gesture-based control, the weight and comfort, and VR in general.\\nplay\\nThe Verge's Nilay Patel offers one of the best Vision Pro overviews. He said it is clear that Apple has the absolute best hardware introduced in a VR headset to date, but there are still major tradeoffs to deal with. Patel found the Vision Pro uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time, and was not a fan of the fit because of its impact on hair and makeup.\\nHe found the Vision Pro to be isolating, and said that the \\\"in there\\\" experience of VR did not come close to the \\\"out there\\\" experience of working in the real world with external devices like the Mac. \\\"You're in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in,\\\" Patel wrote. \\\"I've come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating.\\\"\\nplay\\nThe Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern said that the hand gestures captured by cameras in the headset were intuitive, and that navigation made sense. But sometimes the eye tracking didn't respond to movement, and Patel said he found it distracting to have to be looking at what he wanted to manipulate because that's not the experience on a Mac or an iPhone.\\nThe virtual in-the-air keyboard \\\"will drive you mad for anything longer than a short message,\\\" according to Stern. To do any \\\"real work,\\\" users will need a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. \\nplay\\nThe EyeSight external display was universally disliked by reviewers who found it blurry, unrealistic, and hard to see at best, and creepy at worst. The same goes for Personas. Reviewers did not find them to be an accurate representation of themselves, and others viewing the Personas found them strange and in uncanny valley territory.\\nApple's internal microOLED displays were better received, and reviewers praised the quality, sharpness, and low latency of the display for watching movies, working, and similar tasks. Some pointed out that the color range is more limited than expected, and that there is vignetting at the sides of the display due to the shape of the device. \\nThere's also motion blur, and the cameras work less well in low-light conditions, leading to blurry text and images that are hard to see. That's a problem when the Vision Pro is used in an augmented reality mode, as the cameras are showing a passthrough feed of what's around the wearer. Patel said that it is by far the best video passthrough device to date, but it's still just not as good as looking at the real world. \\nplay\\nThere were no overly impressive app experiences or VR games, though reviewers were impressed with the ability to place windows of any size anywhere in the space around them. Window management is not intuitive, though, and while the Vision Pro can serve as a display for the Mac, users can only set up a single Mac display in visionOS, rather than having a setup that looks like multiple Mac monitors. \\nCNET's Scott Stein was surprised at the lack of blending of virtual and reality in apps or environments given Apple's focus on AR. \\\"I haven't seen virtual things hop on my sofa, or run behind furniture. I haven't placed apps on walls or turned windows into aquariums,\\\" he said. \\\"Apple's ARKit on iOS already can do this, but so far Vision Pro isn't emphasizing these tricks.\\\"\\nReviewers agreed that watching TV and movies was one of the best use cases for the Vision Pro, and Patel said that there is a case to be made for using it as a very expensive TV. There were more mixed reactions to Apple's 3D content, though.\\nStern said that every time she watched one of the 3D 180-degree videos that Apple created for the Vision Pro, she felt nauseous, and Patel also said that spatial videos and other content with a lot of motion can cause nausea. Stein felt that while the videos look impressive, the frame rate and resolution \\\"don't feel good enough to be ultra-real yet.\\\"\\nThe speakers work well and offer decent audio, but they are not isolated and others around the user can hear what's on the headset. Though there are cameras that can capture photos and videos, the quality is not good enough. Stein said he would \\\"never wear the Vision Pro to take photos and videos of [his] family.\\\"\\nNo one minded the battery too much, because the Vision Pro is a headset that is largely meant to be used while seated. Battery life was a bit longer than two hours in most tests, which is in line with what Apple has said.\\nBoth Stern and Patel described the Vision Pro as a clear first-generation product that shows some of the promise of the functionality that might be available as AR and VR technology progress and Apple is able to build a better device. \\nAs the Vision Pro is a niche product, reviewers did not recommend the Vision Pro to the average consumer, and said that most people will not want to spend the $3,500 on it. \\\"The Vision Pro isn't a device I'd recommend to any of my friends or family,\\\" said Stein.\\nMore of reviewers' initial thoughts on the Vision Pro can be found in our review roundup.\\n\\n\\n\\nIssues\\n\\nSome Vision Pro headsets have developed a vertical hairline crack in the middle of the front cover glass, with the crack located above the nose bridge. Reports suggest that these cracks have appeared without the Vision Pro being dropped, and there are enough of the cracks to suggest a hardware manufacturing issue. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow It Works\\n\\nApple Vision Pro is a \\\"mixed reality\\\" headset, meaning it can display both virtual and augmented reality content. It is not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and block out all of your surroundings. \\n\\nApple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented reality component of the device. The cameras are able to map the space around you and project the real world back to you, so though you're not actually looking at what's around you using see-through glasses, you are effectively seeing an accurate picture of your real world environment. \\nWith this capability, Apple can show you 3D windows, objects, and content in your actual space, or the cameras can be turned off to shut out the world to provide an entirely virtual setting. Apple is focusing on the headset's ability to allow for working, content consumption, gaming, communication and other activities to be done \\\"anywhere\\\" with just the Vision Pro.\\n\\n\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nVision Pro is Apple's wearable \\\"spatial computing\\\" device, and while Apple does not refer to it as a headset, that's exactly what it is. The Apple Vision Pro is worn over the head, and it is a virtual/augmented reality headset similar to the PlayStation VR or Meta Quest. \\n\\nDesign wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \\\"three-dimensionally formed.\\\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face. As of now, the headset is only available in silver with matching gray Light Seals and bands. \\nThe frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes. An ill-fitting Light Seal causes the Vision Pro display to be blurry and it allows light to creep in.\\n\\nAt the side of the headset, there are two audio straps that are equipped with speakers that support spatial audio. The audio straps connect to a 3D braided fabric Solo Knit Band that secures the headset to the back of the head, with an adjustable dial for tightening it up for a customizable fit. The main braided headband is detachable so users can swap in different sizes, and perhaps different designs if Apple makes those available in the future. \\n\\nThe Vision Pro comes with both the aforementioned Solo Knit Band that fits around the back of the head and a Dual Loop Band that goes around the back of the head and over the top of the head for weight distribution, so users can choose the best fit. The Dual Loop Band has a two-strap design and it is not made of the same braided material as the Solo Knit Band.\\n\\nEarly testers of the Vision Pro have found that the Dual Loop Band is more comfortable as the headset has been described as heavy. Multiple reviews have mentioned the weight of the device and have said that it can be uncomfortable to wear. The Vision Pro weighs between 21.2 and 22.9 ounces (600 and 650 grams) depending on which Light Seal and head band are used on the device.\\nPhysical controls include a Digital Crown at the top that changes your level of \\\"immersion\\\" and to show you more or less of your real world surroundings through \\\"Environments,\\\" and a top button that serves as a camera button for capturing 3D \\\"spatial\\\" videos and photos. \\n\\nOn the left side of the headset, there is a space to attach a braided cable that provides power to the device. The round charging puck looks like an Apple Watch charging puck, but it clicks into the headset securely with a rotation gesture. \\nThe charging cable attaches to either an external battery pack worn at the waist or a power adapter connected to the wall.\\n\\n\\n\\nDisplay\\n\\nApple Vision Pro is equipped with two custom micro-OLED displays that provide a total of 23 million pixels, which Apple says is \\\"more pixels than a 4K TV.\\\" The headset displays feature a 90Hz refresh rate, but there is a 96Hz refresh rate that can be activated when watching 24 fps movies. \\n\\nThe displays have been described as the size of a postage stamp, but specific hardware information is not known yet. \\nThere's also an external \\\"EyeSight\\\" display that shows the headset wearer's eyes to the people in the room around them. The feature is designed to allow people to know if the headset wearer is using a less immersive augmented reality mode or a fully immersive virtual reality mode. \\nThe eye display that is shown on the exterior display comes from an interior camera that is monitoring the wearer's eyes. It can also alert people when you are recording video with the external camera. \\nLens Inserts\\nApple Vision Pro customers who wear glasses can order Zeiss Optical inserts with their prescription. Zeiss lenses are priced at $149 for a custom prescription, or $99 for readers. The lenses attach magnetically to the displays inside the headset, and can be engraved on the edge. \\nZeiss lenses are available for prescriptions within -11.00D to +6.75D, and prescriptions with prisms are not supported at this time. Vision Pro can be used with soft contacts, but it is not compatible with hard contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n\\nCameras and Sensors\\n\\nApple Vision Pro includes 12 cameras and five sensors for monitoring hand gestures and mapping the external environment. \\n\\nTwo of the cameras transmit more than a billion pixels per second to the display to depict the real world around the wearer when using augmented reality mode, while the others are used for head tracking, hand tracking, and real-time 3D mapping. \\nInfrared flood illuminators enhance hand tracking in low-light conditions, and LiDAR depth sensors determine the size and location of objects in the room around you. \\n\\nFour infrared cameras and LED lights are inside the headset for eye tracking purposes. With this technology, the Vision Pro is able to tell exactly where the wearer is looking for navigation purposes. \\nNavigation\\nThere are no physical controls for the Vision Pro. Navigation is done through eye movements, hand gestures, and voice-based commands. In visionOS, for example, you can highlight an element like an app icon by looking at it, using a quick hand gesture to launch the app. \\n\\nBluetooth keyboards, mice, trackpads, and game controllers can be connected to Vision Pro as an alternative navigation method, though these are mainly designed to be used with a connection to the Mac and for Apple Arcade games. \\nEye and gesture-based navigation is demonstrated in onboarding videos that were pulled from the visionOS software. Apple walks users through looking at a system element and selecting it with a tap of the fingers. The headset is able to detect hand movements even when the hands are resting comfortably in the lap.\\nOptic ID\\nThe infrared cameras and LED lights inside the Vision Pro are used for a security feature called Optic ID. Optic ID is similar to Touch ID or Face ID, but it uses iris scanning instead of a facial scan or a fingerprint scan. \\n\\nEach person has a unique iris pattern, which the headset is able to detect to keep sensitive data on the headset secure. Optic ID can be used like Face ID for unlocking the device, authenticating purchases, and as a password alternative. \\n3D Camera\\nApple included an exterior camera that is able to capture 3D video and 3D photos that are viewable in 3D on the Vision Pro. Apple says that these are like reliving a memory in person because of the \\\"incredible depth\\\" that's available. \\n\\nThe camera gives a clear indicator when recording is turned on so that the headset cannot be used to secretly record video.\\nSeveral members of the media have been able to test the spatial video feature on the Vision Pro, and the feature has been described as so lifelike that it's almost creepy. The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern said that it creates intimacy that 2D photos do not, while CNET's Scott Stein said that the videos are easy to record with the iPhone 15 Pro models and look \\\"compellingly realistic.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAudio\\n\\nThere are speakers on either side of the headset, with the speakers built into the straps that are connected to the frame. The speakers feature dual-driver audio pods that are positioned next to each ear, and they are able to analyze a room's acoustic properties to adapt the sound to match the space. \\nThe speakers support spatial audio for an immersive surround sound experience, plus there are also six microphones for phone calls, video calls, and voice commands. \\nThe Apple Vision Pro pairs with the AirPods for a superior audio experience, and the USB-C AirPods Pro released in September 2023 support 20-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio with ultra-low latency when connected to the Vision Pro.\\n\\n\\n\\nConnectivity\\n\\nThe Vision Pro supports Wi-Fi 6, which operates on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. It does not include support for the faster Wi-Fi 6E specification that is compatible with the 6GHz band.\\n\\n\\n\\nProcessors and RAM\\n\\nApple Vision Pro is powered by a pair of chips. The main processor is the M2, which is the same chip that was first introduced in the 2022 MacBook Air. It is responsible for processing content, running the visionOS operating system, executing computer vision algorithms, and providing graphical content. The M2 chip that is in the Vision Pro features an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU. \\n\\nA second R1 chip is responsible for all of the information coming from the cameras, sensors, and microphones. Apple says that it can stream images to the displays within 12 milliseconds, providing a \\\"virtually lag-free\\\" view of the world. \\n\\nThere is a thermal system inside the Vision Pro that is designed to quietly move air through the headset to control heat and optimize performance. \\nStorage Space\\nThe entry-level Vision Pro is equipped with 256GB of storage space, but Apple also offers upgraded options with 512GB and 1TB of storage.\\n\\n\\n\\nBattery Life\\n\\nWith the external battery pack, the Vision Pro can run for up to two and a half hours, with the 2.5 hour rating listed for watching 2D video. Apple says that the Vision Pro lasts for two hours for general usage. Battery packs can be swapped out for additional power on the go, but the device ships with a single battery pack. When plugged in to a power adapter, the Vision Pro can run all day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvisionOS\\n\\nApple Vision Pro runs visionOS, an operating system that Apple designed specifically for the headset. visionOS is designed to provide an \\\"infinite canvas\\\" with app windows able to go anywhere in the space surrounding the user. \\n\\nApple redesigned apps like Safari, FaceTime, Messages, and more to work in a 3D environment, plus the headset is able to run the full catalog of iPhone and iPad apps. iPhone and iPad apps aren't optimized for 3D, but can be used on the virtual canvas.\\nMovies and TV shows are available through Apple TV+ and other apps, and can be adjusted to look they're on a screen that's \\\"100 feet wide.\\\" visionOS has its own App Store, and specially created immersive 3D content created by Apple. \\nvisionOS is described by Apple as the first spatial operating system because it can be controlled with eyes and hand gestures, with no physical controls necessary.\\nMac Integration\\nvisionOS can be used with a Mac, serving as a display. It works as a giant external display for Mac content, with familiar controls available through connected keyboards, mice, and trackpads.\\n\\nWhen connected to a Mac, the Vision Pro provides a single Mac display, so it is not possible for a setup that looks like you have multiple displays with Mac apps alone. The Mac interface can, however, be used alongside Vision Pro apps for a multi-window experience.\\n\\nYour Mac and Apple Vision Pro: What You Can Do (and What You Can't)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVision Pro How Tos\\n\\n\\nApple Provides Tips For Making Your Persona Look Better\\nThese Are the Gestures Used to Control Vision Pro\\nVision Pro Not Fitting Well?

Customers with these conditions should consult with a healthcare professional before using the Vision Pro, as the headset could aggravate symptoms. \\nHeart conditions\\nMigraines or chronic headaches\\nDizziness or vertigo\\nEye or vision conditions, such as binocular vision conditions\\nPsychological conditions\\nInner ear conditions\\nHistory of dry eyes, itchiness, or swelling of the eyelids \\nSkin allergies or sensitivities\\nSeizures\\nBalance or gait conditions\\nApple adds that pregnant individuals should exercise additional caution when using the Vision Pro due to an increased risk of nausea or loss of balance.\\nApple also warns that the Vision Pro and its battery pack could interfere with nearby electronics, including cardiac pacemakers, hearing aids, and defibrillators.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat's Next for Vision Pro\\n\\nApple has reportedly stopped work on a second-generation version of the Vision Pro headset for the time being to focus its effort on a lower cost model. Apple has been deprioritizing work on a new high-end model and will instead work on a more affordable version with fewer features, though another high-end version of the Vision Pro is still expected at some point.\\nApple is aiming to sell the more affordable Vision Pro at the price of a high-end iPhone, which retails for up to $1,600. The aim was to release it at the end of 2024, but Apple does not yet have a firm prototype. Apple is said to be struggling to find ways to cut down on cost because it wants to keep the high-end display components. \\nTo lower costs, Apple could Apple will eliminate the EyeSight feature and the M-series chip, and use more affordable and lighter weight build materials. \\nApple will likely use larger, lower resolution displays for the more affordable version of the Vision Pro headset. Apple is rumored to be evaluating OLED panels that are up to 2.1 inches in size with a display density of around 1,700 pixels per inch. The Vision Pro has a 1.42-inch display with a pixel density per inch of almost 3,400.\\nThe cheaper Vision Pro could require a tethered iPhone or Mac to operate, which would allow Apple to save money on processing power and components needed to make it a standalone device. \\nSoftware\\nThe Vision Pro is set to gain Apple Intelligence features at some point in the future, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple Intelligence will come to the headset, but not in 2024, so it may be a feature that Apple is saving for visionOS 3 in 2025. The Vision Pro is powerful enough to run on-device Apple Intelligence features like writing tools, notification summaries, and the revamped Siri. \\nSmart Glasses?\\nApple wants to make advanced AR glasses that are based on the Vision Pro headset in the future, but the hardware technology does not exist for such a product as of yet. Apple has instead considered creating a pair of smart glasses that would compete with Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and Amazon's Echo Frames. \\nThe glasses could perhaps serve as an AirPods replacement, featuring built-in speakers, cameras, health sensors, and AI capabilities. Apple is still working on the idea and it is not a product that will launch anytime soon.\\n\\n\\nApple's Long Term AR/VR Plans\\n\\n\\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple could be planning augmented reality \\\"contact lenses\\\" that could launch sometime in the 2030s. According to Kuo, the lenses will bring electronics from the era of \\\"visible computing\\\" to \\\"invisible computing.\\\" There is \\\"no visibility\\\" for the contact lenses at the current time, and it's not a guaranteed product that Apple will develop.\\nApple was also developing augmented reality \\\"Apple Glasses\\\" that were supposed to launch a year or so after the headset, but the project has been placed on hold so the company can instead focus on a cheaper version of the AR/VR headset. Apple Glasses are expected to launch in 2027 at the earliest.\\nA future version of the AR/VR headset could have accessibility settings that are designed to help people who suffer from eye diseases and visual issues. \\nApple's Health Testing\\nIn the future, the Vision Pro could be used to diagnose and treat mental health issues. Apple has tested using the Vision Pro to track a user's facial expressions to detect depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other issues. \\nApple believes that eye-tracking, pupil dilation, and external cameras can measure a person's \\\"affect,\\\" a psychological term that refers to how an individual expresses emotions.

The challenge was making their optic technology consumer-ready\\u2014compact, stylish and affordable, according to Goldman.\\n\\u201cWe use mirrors, which are the oldest optical element that exists, and we\\u2019re using them in a unique way,\\u201d he says.\\u00a0\\nWhile keeping the tiny projector out of the way, content is projected onto what is called a waveguide, so called because it directs the light waves.\\u00a0\\nThis glass substrate (underlying layer), with embedded partially reflecting mirrors, is where the light gets guided through the piece of glass and projected to the users\\u2019 eyes.\\n\\u201cIf you wanted to watch a movie, or if you wanted to do gaming, it would be possible,\\u201d\\u00a0 Goldman says.\\u00a0\\u201cWe can do that with our optics, and those will fit in what looks like a natural pair of glasses.\\u201d\\nThe waveguide is the only part of the smart glasses that doesn\\u2019t exist in another device, Goldman explains. For example, the micro display and the projector are technologies that are part either of smartwatches, mobile phones or screen monitors.\\u00a0\\nThe only new piece of technology for the AR glasses is going to be the waveguide, and that\\u2019s why it\\u2019s so critical, Goldman says.\\n\\u201cIn Israel we have a good reputation in optics from the Weizmann Institute [of Science]. Most of our research has come out of there and we are leaders in this space, which is good for Israel,\\u201d he adds.\\u00a0\\u00a0Sign up for our free weekly newsletterSubscribe\\nThe tech used in the Lumus AR glasses includes display and projector found in smartwatches and cell phones (Photo: Courtesy) \\nIn fact, a good number of Lumus\\u2019 97 employees hold doctorates in physics, optics and other relevant areas of studies.\\u00a0\\nLumus is located in the Israeli city of Ness Ziona, neighboring Weizmann\\u2019s hometown of Rehovot. The two locales form the base of a growing number of manufacturing, production and technology transfer organizations.\\u00a0\\nThe company also has a production line in Penang, Malaysia through Germany\\u2019s SCHOTT, a leading international technology group in the areas of material innovations, specialty glass and glass-ceramics. It has another production facility in Taipei, Taiwan through its partner and Fortune 500 company Quanta Computer, which produces many consumer products including the Apple watch and the MacBook Pro.\\u00a0\\nAnd there is an appetite for this tech among consumers, mostly younger consumers under 40, Goldman asserts.\\n\\u201cThis market is going to come. The companies are very committed to it. They\\u2019re spending billions of dollars on R&D right now, not just in America, but also in China, in Taiwan, to some degree, but less so, in Europe,\\u201d he says.\\u00a0\\nHe estimates that smart glasses will be on the market within a few years for the early adopters. After that, he says, we will see \\u201cmillions of units\\u201d become available.\\u00a0\\nAs such, Lumus is working with their manufacturing partners on building a supply chain robust enough to handle millions of orders that he is optimistic will come once consumers become more used to the concept.\\n\\u201cWe are poised to go now, though initially it won\\u2019t be millions of sales. It\\u2019s a really big ask to go from using a mobile device to suddenly using a display near the eye, and so it\\u2019s going to start in the tens of thousands of orders a month, then to hundreds of thousands a month, and eventually\\u2026 millions,\\u201d he predicts.\\nLumus is at various stages with various customers whose names he is unable to reveal at this time, he says. In some cases, they are working on a real product with a target date for release and in others, they are doing pilot programs with large technology companies or just evaluating whether they want to use Lumus or one of their competitors.\\nGoldman explains that the Lumus AR glasses allow the wearer to remain in the present while using the technology, making it an asset rather than a distraction.\\n\\u201cWe don\\u2019t want you to be separated from the world,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIf we were to meet face to face, and you forgot my name, you would see my name through the glasses \\u2013 it would be floating just above my head.\\u201d\\u00a0\\nHe ticks off some of the other improvements he believes AR glasses will help with, including real-time translations, seamless navigation without ever taking your eyes off the road, and 3D projected holograms of the people you are talking via video calls, giving you the sensation of being in the same room.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a quantum leap,\\u201d he says.\\nThe Lumus AR glasses sport the heavy frames made popular by designer brands (Photo: Courtesy) \\nHighlighting the company\\u2019s discreet optical engine weighing in at about 11 grams per eye and the lightweight design aimed at mimicking conventional eyewear aesthetics, Goldman says the eyewear is practically indistinguishable from some of the heavier-framed glasses favored by designers such as Armani.\\n\\u201cThat was the goal. And for the kinds of companies that we\\u2019re working with now, it has to look good,\\u201d he says.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\u201cIt won\\u2019t be considered wearable if no one wants to wear it, right? So, we have an expression here- \\u2018the face is sacred space.\\u2019 No one wants to wear anything that makes them look like a dork.\\u201d\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSubscribe to NoCamels weekly newsletter and get our top stories\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\nWith Surgical Precision, AI Platform Cuts Wasted Operating Room Time\\n\\nJuly 16, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStartup Can Read Our Thoughts From Our Involuntary Actions\\n\\nJuly 11, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI Platform Lets Organizations Dive Deep Into Their Own Data\\n\\nJuly 10, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHigh-Tech Hopes For Ravaged North Of Israel, Just As It Really Needs It\\u00a0\\n\\nJuly 08, 2024\\n \\n\\n\\nFacebook comments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWeekly Newsletter\\n\\n\\nNOCAMELS\\nWeekly Highlights\\nStraight To Your Inbox\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nVideo Storieslike usNoCamels -

Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset (Apple calls it a \\u201cSpatial Computer\\u201d) that marries an M2 processor with a lot of custom silicon, sensors, cameras, and more. The starting price of $3,499 means that it\\u2019s a niche product, but it\\u2019s the first in a new category that Apple believes will be critical in the coming years.\\nUpdate July 12: Vision Pro is now available in the U.K., Canada, Australia France, and Germany.\\n\\nApple Vision Pro: Worldwide availability\\nAfter the U.S. launch in February 2024, Apple had said that the Vision Pro would be shipping to \\u201cmore countries\\u201d later in 2024. At WWDC Apple announced which countries and when: \\n\\nChina (mainland): June 28\\nHong Kong: June 28\\nJapan: June 28\\nSingapore: June 28\\nAustralia: July 12\\nCanada: July 12\\nFrance: July 12\\nGermany: July 12\\nU.K.: July 12\\n\\nVision Pro is now available to purchase in all of the above countries and the U.S. It\\u2019s unclear when or if Apple plans to launch the new headset in other countries beyond these.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro: Price and availability\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Read our review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe headset was first announced at WWDC on June 5, 2023, with pre-orders starting January 19, 2024, and availability in the U.S. only on February 2. The starting price is $3,499 for 256GB of storage, with a 512GB model available for $3,699 and a 1TB model for $3,899. \\nNow that Apple has started to sell the Vision Pro outside the U.S. we have the price for those other territories:\\n\\n\\nChina: 29,999 yuan\\nHong Kong: HK$27,999\\nJapan: 599,800 yen\\nSingapore: S$5,299\\nAustralia: A$5,999 inc. GST\\nCanada: $4,999 (CAD)\\nFrance: \\u20ac3 999 \\nGermany: \\u20ac3.999\\nU.K.: \\u00a33,499\\n\\nYou can only buy a Vision Pro online directly from Apple\\u2019s website, by using the Apple Store app on your iPhone, or at an Apple Store. Part of the reason for this is the necessity to get a proper fit and optical insert if needed. Apple takes a scan of your face (you do this yourself with your iPhone if you are buying online) to select a proper face seal size. If you wear prescription eyewear or need readers, you can order special Zeiss inserts for $99/\\u00a399 (readers) or $149/\\u00a3149 (prescription). The headset is not designed to work with your existing eyewear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\n\\nApple\\n\\n\\nApple\\nThere are also other accessories available for purchase, including a travel case ($199/\\u00a3199), battery ($199/\\u00a3199), Belkin Battery Holder ($50/\\u00a349.95), Solo knit Band ($99/\\u00a399), Dual Loop Band ($99/\\u00a399), Light Seal ($199/\\u00a3199), and Light Seal Cushion ($29/\\u00a325). AppleCare+ is also available for $499/\\u00a3499 for two years.\\n\\n\\nWill there be a cheaper Apple Vision Pro? \\nWe take the fact that the Vision Pro has the word \\u201cPro\\u201d in its name as a big hint that a more affordable version will be coming down the line. An \\u201cApple Vision Air,\\u201d if you will. \\nApple is thought to be working on two new Vision products: a refreshed high-end \\u201cPro\\u201d model with enhanced capabilities, and a more affordable model that Apple would aim to sell for a price similar to that of a high-end iPhone.\\n\\nNew rumors about the successor to Vision Pro \\u2013 both what it will be and when it will arrive \\u2013 change frequently. They all have one thing in common, though: there isn\\u2019t expected to be any new hardware in 2024. Bloomberg\\u2019s Mark Gurman believes that a cheaper headset will arrive in 2025. He reported in October 2023 that Apple is already working on the sequel to the headset, which will be cheaper than the original model.\\nIn June 2024 a report in The Information claimed that Apple had killed the development of the Vision Pro 2 in order to focus on a lower-cost headset for 2025. However, Apple is said to be struggling to bring down manufacturing costs without cutting back on features and performance too much.\\n\\n\\nThe Vision Pro is likely to follow the example of the HomePod with the expensive pro model paving the way for a cheaper option down the line. But it could be a while before the economies of scale and advancements in technology make a cheaper Apple Vision product viable.\\nApple Vision Pro: Compatibility \\nThe Vision Pro is its own product with its own software ecosystem. It has its own App Store, and runs software independent from other Apple products (though apps like Messages and Photos can sync via iCloud with your other Apple products).\\n\\nThere is support for iPad apps, however. By default, all iPad apps are made available for use on Vision Pro and can be found in the Vision Pro app store, but developers can opt not to allow their apps to be used on the device. White many iPad apps are available, prominent exceptions include YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix.\\nApple Vision Pro: Specs\\nThe Vision Pro is powered by an M2 processor with 8 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores\\u2013the same as you would find in a MacBook. It has 16GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of flash storage.\\n\\n\\nThere are 14 cameras on the inside and outside, a LiDAR scanner, multiple IR illuminators, an accelerometer, gyroscope, and multiple microphones. A custom R1 processor is made to process the vast amount of data from these sensors very quickly, for lightning-fast eye tracking and a delay for the video pass-through of only 12 milliseconds.\\nWhen wearing the Vision Pro you look through custom catadioptric pancake lenses at a pair of micro-OLED displays, one for each eye. About the size of a postage stamp, each of these displays has a stunning resolution of about 3,386 pixels per inch, more than 4K per eye. Of course, what matters is pixels per degree when looking through the lenses, which on Vision Pro is around 34 pixels per degree (less than you\\u2019d see looking at an iPhone display, but more than most other VR headsets).\\nApple does not disclose the field of view for the Vision Pro, but it appears to be somewhere around 110\\u00b0 horizontally and 90\\u00b0 vertically.\\nThe Vision Pro is actively cooled, with a fan inside, but the fan runs so quietly you can\\u2019t hear it.\\n\\n\\nThere are two individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod on the side of the headset near the headband connection. They deliver Personalized Spatial Audio based on the user\\u2019s own head and ear geometry. As a result, the sound feels like it is coming from the space around you. Vision Pro also matches the sound to the room using audio raytracing. \\nThe Vision Pro also recognizes the user\\u2019s iris via a new method to unlock the device and authenticate passwords and purchases called Optic ID. Like the iPhone and Mac, all data is stored on a dedicated Secure\\u00a0Enclave processor.  \\nOn the outside of the headset is an OLED display with a lenticular lens over it that Apple calls EyeSight. It projects a rendered image of your own eyes with correct perspective, so others can see you looking at them. If you are in a fully immersive environment and can\\u2019t see anyone, the EyeSight display shows a blueish haze.\\nBattery life \\nApple Vision Pro connects to an external battery via a custom tether, and the battery lasts for around 2 to 2.5 hours. The battery pack has a USB-C port that can only be used to recharge it, though you can use the Vision Pro with the battery plugged in.\\n\\n\\nWeight and dimensions\\nAccording to Apple Vision Pro tech specs, the headset weighs 21.2 to 22.9 ounces (600 to 650 grams) depending on the Light Seal and headband configuration. That\\u2019s about the weight of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (24 ounces/682\\u00a0grams). It\\u2019s not necessarily heavier than other VR headsets but quite a bit heavier than the Meta Quest 3, which weighs 18.2 ounces (516 grams).\\nThe weight is very front-heavy, mostly in the metal and glass out in the front of the face seal instead of distributed around the sides. The battery pack weighs 12.5 ounces (353 grams). \\nApple Vision Pro: Hands-on and overall experience\\nIn our Apple Vision Pro review, we found the technology very impressive, but the comfort and software\\u2014both apps and operating system\\u2014quite limited. There\\u2019s a lot of potential there, but it will take quite a while for the software to mature enough to unlock it, and for most users, the Vision Pro will never be worth the price. \\nWith a Vision Pro headset users will be able to watch a movie, listen to music, browse photos, look at 3D objects, and even collaborate on a presentation. \\n\\n\\nUsers experience a three-dimensional interface and input system that they control with their eyes, hands, and voice. You select things by looking at them and pinching your fingers together, then dragging objects around or flicking your hand to scroll. A virtual keyboard is used to enter text where appropriate, either by poking at the keys or looking at each key in succession and pinching your fingers together. You can also use voice input to enter text, or a Bluetooth keyboard.\\nApple has posted a 10-minute guided tour explaining how navigation and gestures work as well as several apps.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\n\\nApple\\n\\n\\nApple\\nWhen you first put on Vision Pro you see your surroundings. You can freely move apps to fill the space around you and they can expand into your space. The digital crown lets you adjust the volume or the degree of immersion in your environment\\u2013from fully immersed in a virtual space to seeing \\u201cpass-through\\u201d video of your own space. Here\\u2019s a primer on what the Vision Pro buttons do.\\nA user can bring a Mac wirelessly into the Apple Vision Pro space just by looking at it and choosing to connect to it if it is logged into the same Apple ID. The Mac display will blank out and be replaced by a big 4K virtual display in your Vision Pro environment; you\\u2019ll continue to use the Mac keyboard and touchpad, however, and audio will still play from the Mac.\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro: Software and apps\\nThe Vision Pro headset runs visionOS, an operating system that Apple has designed from the ground up for visual computing. Apple launched a number of native Vision Pro versions of its apps at launch, such as Safari, Messages, and FaceTime. Apple launched Vision Pro with more than 600 optimized apps. The latest version is visionOS 1.1, which includes support for managed profiles, improved Personas, and lots of bug fixes and minor improvements.\\nIn fall 2024, Apple will release visionOS 2, the first major update to the OS. It will bring numerous refinements and upgrades, including the ability to transform regular, 2D photos into spatial photos, and wide and ultra-wide screen views with Mac Virtual Display.\\nApple Vision Pro: Glossary and terminology\\nAs with many Apple products, the company has some of its own branding around things that may be better understood by other names. Here are some of the things you may see associated with Vision Pro and what they mean.\\nSpatial Computing: Computing that appears to happen in the environment around you rather than inside a computer (or phone). A sort of umbrella term that encapsulates AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality), and MR (Mixed Reality). It is not inaccurate to call Vision Pro a mixed-reality headset.\\n\\n\\nSpatial apps: Apps designed with the Vision Pro hardware in mind, as opposed to iPad apps running in a window. Some Spatial apps are fully immersive experiences, others are almost indistinguishable from iPad apps.\\nFully immersive: A \\u201cfully immersive\\u201d experience is one in which your surroundings are not visible: you\\u2019re completely surrounded in a virtual environment. In other words Virtual Reality.\\nSpatial Audio: Audio that seems to come from specific places in your environment. \\nPersona: A 3D digital recreation of you, created by scanning your face using the Vision Pro cameras. It is meant to be used to represent you in video conferencing apps like FaceTime or Zoom since the Vision Pro has no cameras that can actually see your face (just specialized internal cameras for eye tracking).\\n\\n\\nSpatial Video: A new 3D video format that can be captured with either the Vision Pro or an iPhone 15 Pro. Spatial Videos can be viewed using a Vision Pro or even a Quest headset, and look a bit like a 3D diorama of a memory. It\\u2019s an emotionally charged and effective way of capturing the moment.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tMacworld is your best source for all things Apple.

Courtesy of NSS Canada.                                \\n\\n\\nNSS Canada, a Sudbury, Ontario-based mining technology company, has incorporated an augmented reality (AR) display into its underground surveying software.\\u00a0\\nIts proprietary Miner Operated Survey System (MOSS) integrates mine design specifications and drawings, and supplies data in real time, so that users can complete markups of the mine face underground and create a blasting plan. The technology has been on the market since 2017, with clients that include Vale Base Metals, Glencore, Newmont and Pan American Silver.\\u00a0\\nNSS Canada has spent the last two years developing MOSS AR and demonstrated the technology at the Mining Transformed exhibition, which took place from May 27-29, at the NORCAT Underground Centre in Sudbury. The company announced that it has moved into the pilot stage for MOSS AR and is currently looking for mining companies to test it at their underground operations.\\u00a0\\nKaitlynn Zygmont, sales and marketing director for NSS Canada, told CIM Magazine in an interview that the new technology provides real-time holographic projections of all survey and planned data, and significantly reduces the amount of equipment, and time, required to conduct surveying underground.\\u00a0\\nThe MOSS AR set-up includes a hard hat that is outfitted with Microsoft\\u2019s HoloLens 2, a tablet that connects to the HoloLens via Bluetooth, and two printed QR codes that utilize existing survey control points; this configuration replaces the total station, tripod and prisms that were previously required to get the job done. Zygmont said that MOSS AR can mark up the underground area in three to five minutes, compared to about 20 minutes using MOSS without AR.\\u00a0\\n\\u201cThis is something that allows the users to move faster underground,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIn addition to that, it eliminates your interaction with the face. Obviously, miners want to [limit] their interactions with the face as much as possible, because that\\u2019s where rockfalls happen, and there\\u2019s potential for injury. You\\u2019re able to stay three to five metres away from the face with MOSS AR. And you\\u2019re not needing to do any physical markup with the face at all anymore, because everything\\u2019s just done with hand gestures and with the augmented reality display.\\u201d\\u00a0\\nHow it works is the blasted face profile is captured by the HoloLens 2, creating a digital twin of the drift. The data is then exported in real time to the tablet, where the miner can calculate overbreak and design a blast pattern based on the captured face.\\u00a0\\n\\u201cAt that last step, you\\u2019re able to see the completed markup, and you\\u2019re ready to see all the drill hole patterns,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s really cool to be able to see the visual of all those drill hole patterns of what the jumbo operator would see.\\u201d\\u00a0\\nZygmont described the technology, which she said is unique in the market, as the future of mining\\u2014something that could potentially become part of every miner\\u2019s surveying toolkit.\\u00a0\\nBen Rantala, senior technical support specialist for NSS Canada, told CIM Magazine in an interview that safety was the biggest consideration when designing the product: \\u201cMaking sure that the visuals would be good underground safety-wise, because the number one thing [underground] is safety.

This article has covered observations made by analysts at IDC and Omdia on the recent developments in the XR industry.\\nDespite a projected stagnation in near-eye display shipments for 2024, the long-term outlook for the market remains positive, Kimi Lin said in a recent Omdia report.\\n\\u201cWith advancements in display, optical, and other component technologies, Omdia is optimistic about the long-term outlook. Near-eye display shipments are projected to grow rapidly from 2027, reaching 92.9 million units by 2030,\\u201d stated Kimi Lin, Senior Research Analyst at Omdia.\\nThe global display industry is set to convene at the Omdia Display Conference from September 12-13, 2024, in Shanghai, China. During the event, Kimi Lin and a team of Omdia analysts will present their research on the latest innovations within the display sector.\\nXR market\\nThe XR market, which includes AR, VR, and MR, is currently facing a downturn, causing significant layoffs at leading companies and prompting several smartphone brands to halt or scale back their XR projects. Despite these setbacks, industry leaders are determined to rejuvenate the market and drive growth in the coming years, Omdia said.\\nFor instance, Microsoft announced layoffs primarily targeting its mixed reality (MR unit, responsible for the HoloLens 2 AR headset.\\nTechnology major Google is cutting hundreds of jobs in its AR (Augmented Reality) hardware and voice assistant businesses, according to reports.\\nAnother tech giant Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs in 2023.\\nChina-based ByteDance-owned virtual reality (VR) headset maker Pico is conducting a new round of\\u00a0job cuts\\u00a0in line with a restructuring.\\nThe latest IDC report said global shipments of augmented reality and virtual reality (AR VR) headsets fell 67.4 percent in the first quarter of 2024 as the market is transitioning to include new categories such as Mixed Reality (MR) and Extended Reality (ER).\\n\\nThe average selling price (ASP) of AR and VR headsets rose to over $1000 as Apple entered the market and incumbents such as Meta focused on premium headsets such as the Quest 3.\\nVirtual Reality headsets are forecast to reach 24.7 million units by the end of 2028, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.2 percent as the consumer base slowly grows beyond core gaming use cases and as businesses adopt more headsets for training, design, and more.\\nAugmented Reality headsets will grow from a smaller base of less than a million units in 2024 to 10.9 million in 2028, representing an 87.1 percent CAGR over the same period, Jitesh Ubrani, research manager,\\u00a0Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers\\u00a0at IDC, said.\\nGrowth plans\\nMeta and PICO plan to launch the Quest 3S and PICO 4S in the second half of 2024, both at lower prices than their predecessors to stimulate sales. Meanwhile, Sony\\u2019s PlayStation VR2 (PS VR2) will now support PC VR games, expanding beyond its previous PS5 exclusivity, which is anticipated to boost PS VR2 sales, Omdia said.\\nIDC report on share of AR VR vendors Q1 2024\\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms has announced the initial release of its XR operating systems to third-party OEMs, including ASUS, Lenovo, and Microsoft Xbox. Meta will also focus on enhancing the quality and quantity of its platform and application software to improve hardware terminal sales.\\nIn 2024, the XR market\\u2019s primary focus will be on the Apple Vision Pro. Its high price is expected to limit its sales, preventing it from significantly boosting overall market growth.\\nOmdia predicts that total XR set shipments in 2024 will remain steady compared to 2023, with near-eye display shipments also flat at 17.2 million units. Nonetheless, the Vision Pro has significantly increased the share of OLED on silicon (OLEDoS) displays.\\nThe XR industry is expected to remain stagnant for the next one to two years. While set shipments will experience slight fluctuations, near-eye display shipments are projected to increase more significantly due to the inevitable shift from single to dual displays.\\nBaburajan Kizhakedath\\nTweetShareSharePin\\n\\nPrevious articleEricsson posts 7% drop in sales to $5.7 bn in second-quarterNext articleTPG Telecom and Optus network sharing deal faces review in Australia\\n\\n\\nLatest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAT&T faces questions from senators over cyber-attack affecting 109 mn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTRAI report highlights poor demand for 5G in India\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIndia telecoms poised for ARPU growth with tariff hike and data surge\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nUK regulators probe Big Tech\\u2019s growing influence in digital payment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSK Telecom to invest $200 mn in SMART Global in AI push\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore like thisRelated\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nUK regulators probe Big Tech\\u2019s growing influence in digital payment\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 16, 2024 \\n\\nBritish regulators are investigating the increasing use of digital...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nApple sale in India reaches $8 bn in 2023-24 fiscal\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 15, 2024 \\n\\nApple has generated sales of almost $8 billion in...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSmartphone market growth and leading vendors in second-quarter\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 15, 2024 \\n\\nIDC and Canalys have shared the growth trends in...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nOppo signs global patent cross license agreement with Ericsson\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 15, 2024 \\n\\nOppo, one of the leaders in the smartphone business,...\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nABOUT US\\nPARTNERSHIP\\nPRIVACY POLICY\\nCONTACT US\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNews website for 4G, 5G, Statistics, Telecom Services, Internet, Broadband, Broadcast, Network, Chips, and Smartphones.\\n\\n\\nFacebookLinkedinTwitter\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nABOUT US\\nPARTNERSHIP\\nPRIVACY POLICY\\nCONTACT US\\n\\n\\nThe latest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAT&T faces questions from senators over cyber-attack affecting 109 mn\\n\\nTelecom Services\\n\\nJuly 17, 2024 0 \\n\\nTwo U.S. senators have demanded answers from AT&T regarding...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTRAI report highlights poor demand for 5G in India\\n\\n5G\\n\\nJuly 16, 2024 0 \\n\\nThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has released...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIndia telecoms poised for ARPU growth with tariff hike and data surge\\n\\nTelecom Services\\n\\nJuly 16, 2024 0 \\n\\nIndian telecom companies are set to see a substantial...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a9 2024 Kizhakedath Media Services.

(Courtesy of Lauren Millet-Simpson) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHorses have a funny way of keeping us on our toes, don\\u2019t they? Just when you think things are going one way, we constantly have to pivot another way.\\nOur last update saw the big horse Mr Nobility getting ready to display his progress at the LongRun open house. Unfortunately, he had other plans. The day before the open house he had blood and mucus coming out of his nose. The next day, the morning of the open house, more mucus, coughing, and lots of blood pouring out of his nose. The veterinarian came out for an emergency endoscopy to see what was going on, and unfortunately didn\\u2019t really find much other than a very irritated soft palate and a lot of bloody mucus in the throat. Needless to say, we did not ride at the open house.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tMr Nobility naps in the weirdest places. (Courtesy of Lauren Millet-Simpson)\\t\\n\\n\\nSince we are getting down to the wire as such, we really needed to start going off property and experimenting with different adventures. My coach booked a schooling time at a local show barn for myself and her other student who is going to the Makeover for an off-property ride.\\nThe week leading up to going off property was one of the most frustrating weeks for us in a while. Mr Nobility seemed for forget all manners and went back to his super studly behavior that I thought we had worked him out of. I think we maybe had five minutes of actual forward trot the entire week \\u2014 one day he was so completely ridiculous on the lunge I didn\\u2019t even get on him.\\nI decided to throw him on the trailer anyway and that, at the absolute worst, he would walk around on a new farm and watch another horse working in the ring. I set my expectations six-feet underground so there was no way we could possibly fail!\\nOnce again, horses surprise us. He surprised everyone that day and was a very good 5-year-old for a lot of firsts.\\nAfter walking around the arena for a while getting him used to the fact that another horse was working around him, and teaching him it\\u2019s OK to let the other horse canter by and not react whatsoever, Mr Nobility was level-headed enough to hop on. In my mind, this was already a victory as I truly thought I wouldn\\u2019t even get this far. He had never been in a ring with another horse and handled that well, anything else was bonus!\\nHe was good enough walking around that we did some trot work. He had issues circling to the right and steering was optional, but I chalked that up to inexperience, lots of distractions, and new things. Overall, he was being pretty good!\\nMy coach then set up a little X to jump over. He had never jumped before but she thought he was a horse who would thrive the more we asked of him \\u2026 and boy was she right! Once he fell over the X the first couple times and sent the poles flying, he learned to pick up his feet and ended the day jumping a little vertical with filler. He loved it! He actually paid attention and had better steering while jumping than flatting. Go figure!\\nWe have continued jumping in our lessons and he amazes me each time how much he enjoys it and how engaged he becomes. He is almost a completely different horse when a jump is front of him versus attempting to master a 20-meter circle while balanced and supple. We have now put four jumps together and done a flying change in a very short period of time! Not to mention his most balanced canter seems to be the first several strides after landing a jump.\\nWe have also discovered that his massive, teenage-boy growing body does require some maintenance as we transition into this new career. He is getting regular chiropractic treatments, which he responds really well to, and occasional osteopathy sessions.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tMr Nobility does not appreciate fly gear \\u2026 or flies. (Courtesy of Lauren Millet-Simpson)\\t\\n\\n\\nAs with any athlete, it\\u2019s important to listen to the body and react appropriately when something is not 100%. Mr Nobility is a little bit like \\u201cprincess and the pea\\u201d and he makes no qualms about letting me know immediately when he needs a treatment. He is definitely expensive, but at least he is pretty!\\nAs we continue to progress toward (hopefully!) going to Kentucky in October, and I discover more and more about this wonderful creature, I am amazed at how much they also teach us about ourselves. After my accident a year and a half ago, when a horse I was riding tripped and fell and my leg got pinned underneath him, my confidence was definitely shaken. Prior to that, I would get on anything and not think twice about it. Now there exists a little voice in the back of my head that just adds a moment of hesitation when a horse is acting frisky or stubborn. But Mr Nobility, in all his 17 hands-plus of pure athlete, is re-teaching me to ride the big trot again and to not be afraid to trust in the foundation of my riding and the skills we have developed together. He is a really nice horse that I\\u2019m very lucky to be riding, and when we have those harmonious moments, it really is the most amazing feeling.\\nI hope to take him to our first show in a few weeks and see what we have to work with. As with everything on this journey, I am expecting anything but smooth sailing, so stay tuned for our next update to find out what crazy things are thrown at us this time!\\n\\nThe Jockey Club supports\\u00a0many\\u00a0aftercare initiatives\\u00a0including the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance, the only accrediting body in aftercare, and Thoroughbred Incentive Program (T.I.P.), which encourages the retraining of Thoroughbreds into other disciplines upon completion of careers.\\u00a0View all of the initiatives supported by The Jockey Club.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated News\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nmost popular\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis Week\\nThis Month\\nThis Year\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThoroughbred Makeover Diary: Expect the Unexpected on This Journey\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere to Watch/Listen: Horse Racing Coverage July 17-21\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRoad to Breeders\\u2019 Cup Sneak Peek: Haskell Stakes and Other Key Races\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFive-Time Horse of the Year Kelso: A True \\u2018One of a Kind\\u2019\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeginner\\u2019s Guide to the Breeders\\u2019 Cup World Championships\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLady\\u2019s Secret: Horse Racing\\u2019s Iron Lady\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2021 Kentucky Derby Cheat Sheet\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPreakness Quick Sheet: Get to Know the 2021 Preakness Horses\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet to Know All 13 U.S. Triple Crown Winners\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated Stories\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\nThoroughbred Makeover Diary: Expect the Unexpected on This Journey\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere to Watch/Listen: Horse Racing Coverage July 17-21\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPlanning Underway to Celebrate Preakness 150 With a Festival\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeginner\\u2019s Guide to the 2024 Del Mar Meet\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nget our Newsletter\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\nSign-up now!\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow Us on Social Media\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nComing Up\\nThoroughbred Makeover Diary: Trial Run for Two!\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 TJC Media Ventures.

Exhilarated Republicans are making a display of this in Milwaukee, where the party formally nominated Donald Trump as its presidential nominee. Understandably, Mr Trump appears happy to have defied death. His party is also looking triumphal, with Mr Trump holding a steady lead in national polls and key swing states. Yet it is too soon to judge how durable this advantage will be.Saturday\\u2019s attack has also affected Democrats. It disrupted and may have finished off the faltering effort within the party to replace Joe Biden as its nominee. After the shooting, the atmosphere of anxiety and shock made it untenable for Democratic rebels in Congress to advance their attempt to challenge Mr Biden\\u2019s candidacy. No new House member or senator has publicly called on the president to step aside since Friday. Meanwhile, the president and his allies have kept to their plan to thwart Mr Biden\\u2019s doubters by playing for time. The strategy is working. Two weeks ago PredictIt, a political betting market, signalled that Mr Biden was more likely than not to be replaced. On Tuesday it gave him a 72% chance of being the nominee.Explore moreUnited StatesElectionsJoe BidenDonald TrumpShareReuse this contentMore from United StatesBob Menendez is found guilty of corruptionFrom head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to convicted foreign agentA maverick judge tosses Donald Trump\\u2019s classified documents caseThe ruling may be reversed\\u2014but delay helps the former presidentJ.D.

Turns out, the Seattle Kraken netminder is equally adept appearing ON-screen.\\nAs the old Simpsons character Troy McClure used to say, \\u201cYou might have seen Phillip Grubauer in such films as Welcome to our Crib! and 40 NHL Broadcasts over the past year!\\u201c, Grubauer tends to find himself as a leading man in many a project about and for friends and partners of the Kraken. Of course, many a fan may remember their first interaction with Grubauer\\u2019s acting chops and camera-savvy from his time with the team\\u2019s collaboration with the Filson outdoor apparel company back in 2023; labelled Uncharted, but his range extends far beyond his admittedly extremely admirable love of the natural world; he can bring that affable nature to the realm of the small screen.\\nIf you\\u2019ve watched the titantron at CPA, or stopped by the Kraken\\u2019s YouTube page, you\\u2019ve likely seen the native of Rosenheim, Germany in Welcome to Our Crib! Peek Into Tours @ Climate Pledge Arena with Philipp Grubauer.\\nIt\\u2019ll soon become clear why Philipp Grubauer is visiting the Kraken players\\u2019 bench without goalie gear.YouTube Screengrab\\nMaking his way to the players benches, he explains, \\u201cThis is where the magic happens.\\u201d Standing in front of the WNBA Seattle Storm locker room, he says, \\u201cI have great roommates, too.\\u201d Pointing to a blank door with a plaque reading \\u201cNBA Locker Room,\\u201d Grubauer says, \\u201cMaybe someday, we\\u2019ll get a few more!\\u201d\\nWere film critic Roger Ebert still alive, he probably would have written, \\u201cI haven\\u2019t seen dramatic range like that since DeNiro in Raging Bull.\\u201d\\nGrubi\\u2019s First Visit To The Space Needle\\nHis talent doesn\\u2019t just extend to solo performances, however. Last summer, Seinfeld writer Peter Mehlman chatted up Grubauer in a video for VisitSeattle.org, a city tourism organization. This was actually shown before movies at AMC theaters.\\nSeinfeld writer Peter Mehlman (left), borrowing Grubauer\\u2019s goalie equipment in the Kraken dressing room. Not that there\\u2019s anything wrong with that. | VisitSeattle.org Screengrab\\nApparently there\\u2019s no hockey superstition about letting non-players try on equipment, because the goalie generously lends Mehlman his blocker, trapper glove, and even his mask. Showing his imposing chest protector, he helpfully explains that \\u201cIt\\u2019s like RoboCop.\\u201d Considering what it takes to become a RoboCop, one would probably say being a goalie is a better gig.\\nWith the same probing curiosity one might expect from a Seinfeld writer; Mehlman asks, \\u201cYou spell your name with one \\u2018L\\u2019 and three \\u2018P\\u2019s. What\\u2019s up with that?\\u201d Using the alacrity he shows on the ice, Grubauer ad-libs, \\u201cI blame my parents for that.\\u201d\\nKraken goalie Philipp Grubauer (left), hoping his first Space Needle visit won\\u2019t be his last. |VisitSeattle.org Screengrab\\nLater, they do the tourist-y thing and visit the Space Needle. Leaning forward for a better view of Puget Sound, Grubauer knocks on the glass to make sure it will support his weight. Which is a bit like asking if the poisonous pufferfish has been cooked safely after you\\u2019ve taken a bite. \\nThe barrier fortunately is sturdy, and the goalie and writer don\\u2019t fall 500 feet to gruesome deaths. (Though \\u201cGruesome Grubauer\\u201d would have made an awesome headline. Maybe if he does a Budget horror flick with Neon/Blumhouse this halloween?)\\nNo Goalie Likes Red Flashing Lights: Grubauer the IT Guardian.\\nMost recently, the goalie stars in a series of vignettes for computer security company WatchGuard; a tour de force of seven promotional spots. At one point, the goalie is practicing when Kraken Community Iceplex becomes bathed in a flashing red glow while an alarm sounds. \\nGrubauer, in full gear, scrambles up steps toward the team offices because, \\u201cIt\\u2019s my job to defend the Kraken. They need me!\\u201d Again, Spoiler Alert: by the time he reaches the I.T. department, the security software has neutralized the cyberattack.\\nGrubauer, in the Kraken offices, explaining the dangers of a phishing trip.WatchGuard Screengrab\\nSomewhat despondent, Grubauer plops onto a couch next to a Kraken employee typing on a laptop. When the employee appears to be viewing a suspicious site, Grubauer perks up. \\u201cDon\\u2019t click that link, it looks like a phishing email!\\u201d The grateful employee, who doesn\\u2019t seem to mind his couchmate\\u2019s wandering eyes, responds, \\u201cThanks, Grubi. You should join the I.T. department.\\u201d In the most recent spot, which premiered July 9, the goaltender does just that.\\nBy the way, the Kraken do have an actual information technology department, some of whose members co-starred in the Grubauer spots to cover their most famous desk jockey. \\u201cSports teams have unique cybersecurity challenges,\\u201d I.T. director Sean Rawlins told SDxCentral. \\u201cPlayers and staff are on the road half the season, and team scouts travel the world to find fresh talent.

It was Mr. Biden\\u2019s first major meeting as president with foreign dignitaries.\\n\\nMr. Biden, who was 78, publicly chided British Prime Minister Boris Johnson for not introducing the president of South Africa, even though Mr. Johnson had already introduced him by name.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nMr. Biden appeared confused. He looked around the room bewilderedly before mumbling, \\u201cOh, he did?\\u201d His words trailed off, and the other leaders broke into laughter.\\nWeeks earlier, Mr. Biden forgot the name of his secretary of defense. After a few seconds of struggling, the president called him \\u201cthe guy who runs that outfit over there.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\nFew news outlets in the U.S. covered the president\\u2019s mental misfires, and lawmakers on both sides of the aisle ignored them.\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n  \\n    SEE ALSO: \\u2018More determined\\u2019 Biden eager to prove presidential fitness despite mounting concerns\\n  \\n  \\n\\nStill, those incidents provided the first glimpse of a spark that has erupted into a three-alarm fire engulfing the Democratic Party ahead of the November elections.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSince Mr. Biden\\u2019s confused and sometimes incoherent June 27 debate with former President Donald Trump, panicked Democrats have called for Mr. Biden to bow out of the presidential race and to be replaced with a younger candidate.\\nYet questions about Mr. Biden\\u2019s fitness to serve were apparent years before the debate when he struggled to complete his thoughts and stared vacantly. Though The Washington Times chronicled Mr. Biden\\u2019s deterioration and polls recorded voters\\u2019 growing doubts about his fitness for office, mainstream media outlets rarely reported the story.\\n\\u201cIt makes the media look partisan,\\u201d said Richard Benedetto, a former White House correspondent who teaches journalism at American University. \\u201cI have no doubt that the White House press corps knew all along that Biden was slipping, but they thought he was a better choice than Donald Trump and looked the other way. We didn\\u2019t see any of these stories before the debate.\\u201d\\nDavid Paleologos, director of the Political Research Center at Suffolk University, dismissed the idea of a media conspiracy to cover up Mr. Biden\\u2019s health concerns.\\n\\u201cLook at all the podcasters and people who have looked at it pretty fairly and knew three years ago that Biden was unpopular and knew three years ago that his health wasn\\u2019t going to get better,\\u201d he said.\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n    \\n      SEE ALSO: Biden campaign brushes off Trump golf challenge, calls it \\u2018weird antics\\u2019\\n    \\n    \\n\\nThroughout Mr. Biden\\u2019s presidency, aides have aggressively resisted the idea that he has become diminished and have tried to change the narrative to whether Mr. Trump tells the truth.\\nThey shielded the president from news media as concerns about his age mounted.\\nA hallmark of Mr. Biden\\u2019s presidency has been the lack of public visibility in situations that aren\\u2019t scripted or tightly controlled. According to data from Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project, Mr. Biden held 36 news conferences through June 30, fewer than any other president in the same time frame since President Reagan.\\nMr. Biden has given 129 interviews, compared with Mr. Trump\\u2019s 369 and President Obama\\u2019s 497 during the same period. One of Mr. Biden\\u2019s interviews, with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News, was hastily scheduled after the debate debacle.\\nThe American people noticed problems less than 10 months into Mr. Biden\\u2019s presidency. A November 2021 Politico/Morning Consult poll revealed that 50% of voters said Mr. Biden was not in good health.\\nThat represented a massive 29-percentage-point shift since October 2020, when voters overwhelmingly said he was in good health.\\nIn the same poll, 48% of voters said Mr. Biden was not mentally fit to serve as president, compared with 46% who said he was. That negative 2-point margin starkly contrasted with the October 2020 poll, when voters said, by a 21-point margin, that he was mentally fit.\\nThe poll was released just weeks after Mr. Biden appeared to fall asleep during opening remarks of the COP26 climate change summit.\\nDemocratic pollster Celinda Lake told Politico that the findings were the result of the \\u201cright-wing disinformation machine.\\u201d\\nBy August 2023, the share of voters saying Mr. Biden was too old to effectively serve a second term soared to 75% in an Associated Press/NORC poll, and 60% said he didn\\u2019t have the mental capabilities to serve as president.\\nBy February, 86% of Americans said Mr. Biden was too old to serve a second term.\\nMr. Paleologos said Democrats didn\\u2019t heed the polls\\u2019 warnings because they were in denial about what the American public was seeing.\\n\\u201cThe reason no one acted on [health concerns] is because there was a feeling the numbers would change and his numbers would flip back to where they were in January 2021 when Biden was highly popular,\\u201d he said.\\nDemocrats banked on the debate against Mr. Trump as the moment Mr. Biden\\u2019s numbers would rebound, but panic ensued instead.\\n\\u201cThe debate was supposed to be an inflection point for the campaign, but the opposite happened, and now time is ticking away, and the situation was made worse,\\u201d Mr. Paleologos said.\\nDavid Dix, a Democratic Party strategist, said Democrats waited until it was too late to listen to voters\\u2019 concerns about Mr. Biden\\u2019s age. Mr. Dix said the real failure was a lack of succession planning. Democrats have not had a competitive primary since 2008, before President Obama\\u2019s first term.\\n\\u201cThe party told everyone it was going to be Hillary in 2016 and Biden in 2020,\\u201d he said. \\u201cYou can\\u2019t make up for the exercise that both the candidate and party go through when you have a vigorous and earnest primary. The fact that Democrats haven\\u2019t has atrophied their connection to the common, regular voters.\\u201d\\nAs voter concerns about Mr. Biden\\u2019s age increased, so did his number of memory lapses. The president made headlines in September 2022 when he asked for Jackie Walorski to stand up, even though the House lawmaker had died a month earlier. Immediately after her death, Mr. Biden issued a statement offering condolences and ordered flags lowered to half-staff.\\nA year later, Mr. Biden bizarrely wrapped up a gun safety speech by declaring, \\u201cGod save the queen, man.\\u201d The White House dismissed questions about his statement by saying he was talking to someone in the crowd.\\nA gush of memory lapses was revealed in February when special counsel Robert Hur issued a report outlining his decision not to prosecute Mr. Biden for mishandling sensitive government documents. Mr. Hur wrote in his report that Mr. Biden couldn\\u2019t recall basic facts of his life, including when his son died or when he was vice president.\\nHe said a jury would view Mr. Biden sympathetically as \\u201ca well-meaning, elderly man with a poor memory.\\u201d\\nInstead of calling for Mr. Biden to step down, Democrats dismissed Mr. Hur as a partisan out to derail the president\\u2019s reelection.\\nMr. Biden compounded the damage with his performance in a rare 13-minute press conference on the evening the report was released. He confused Egypt\\u2019s president with Mexico\\u2019s when talking about the war in Gaza. He also created a political problem for Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi\\u00a0by saying he had to be persuaded to allow humanitarian aid into Gaza.\\n\\nA week before the Hur report, Mr. Biden twice recalled speaking with a European leader who had died years earlier. During a series of fundraisers in New York, Mr. Biden said he had discussed the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol with German Prime Minister Helmut Kohl, who died in 2017. Days earlier, Mr. Biden talked about meeting French President Francois Mitterrand in 2021. The French leader died in 1996.\\n\\n\\u2022 Jeff Mordock can be reached at jmordock@washingtontimes.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 The Washington Times, LLC. \\n                        \\n                          Click\\n                            here for reprint permission.\\n\\nPlease read\\n  our comment policy before commenting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Click to Read More and View Comments\\n                    \\n Click to Hide \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTop of the Times\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch\\nSearch Keyword:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Search\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSEE MORE VIDEOS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Advertisement\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Advertisement\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nFront Page Podcast\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommentary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClifford D.

Millions have been spent on diamonds and emeralds the size of credit cards, on haute couture saris, on wedding invitations made of silver and gold.Billionaire businessmen, Bollywood stars, models and politicians were among the more than 1,200 guests at a pre-wedding bash in March.

Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset (Apple calls it a \\u201cSpatial Computer\\u201d) that marries an M2 processor with a lot of custom silicon, sensors, cameras, and more. The starting price of $3,499 means that it\\u2019s a niche product, but it\\u2019s the first in a new category that Apple believes will be critical in the coming years.\\nUpdate July 12: Vision Pro is now available in the U.K., Canada, Australia France, and Germany.\\n\\nApple Vision Pro: Worldwide availability\\nAfter the U.S. launch in February 2024, Apple had said that the Vision Pro would be shipping to \\u201cmore countries\\u201d later in 2024. At WWDC Apple announced which countries and when: \\n\\nChina (mainland): June 28\\nHong Kong: June 28\\nJapan: June 28\\nSingapore: June 28\\nAustralia: July 12\\nCanada: July 12\\nFrance: July 12\\nGermany: July 12\\nU.K.: July 12\\n\\nVision Pro is now available to purchase in all of the above countries and the U.S. It\\u2019s unclear when or if Apple plans to launch the new headset in other countries beyond these.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro: Price and availability\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Read our review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe headset was first announced at WWDC on June 5, 2023, with pre-orders starting January 19, 2024, and availability in the U.S. only on February 2. The starting price is $3,499 for 256GB of storage, with a 512GB model available for $3,699 and a 1TB model for $3,899. \\nNow that Apple has started to sell the Vision Pro outside the U.S. we have the price for those other territories:\\n\\n\\nChina: 29,999 yuan\\nHong Kong: HK$27,999\\nJapan: 599,800 yen\\nSingapore: S$5,299\\nAustralia: A$5,999 inc. GST\\nCanada: $4,999 (CAD)\\nFrance: \\u20ac3 999 \\nGermany: \\u20ac3.999\\nU.K.: \\u00a33,499\\n\\nYou can only buy a Vision Pro online directly from Apple\\u2019s website, by using the Apple Store app on your iPhone, or at an Apple Store. Part of the reason for this is the necessity to get a proper fit and optical insert if needed. Apple takes a scan of your face (you do this yourself with your iPhone if you are buying online) to select a proper face seal size. If you wear prescription eyewear or need readers, you can order special Zeiss inserts for $99/\\u00a399 (readers) or $149/\\u00a3149 (prescription). The headset is not designed to work with your existing eyewear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\n\\nApple\\n\\n\\nApple\\nThere are also other accessories available for purchase, including a travel case ($199/\\u00a3199), battery ($199/\\u00a3199), Belkin Battery Holder ($50/\\u00a349.95), Solo knit Band ($99/\\u00a399), Dual Loop Band ($99/\\u00a399), Light Seal ($199/\\u00a3199), and Light Seal Cushion ($29/\\u00a325). AppleCare+ is also available for $499/\\u00a3499 for two years.\\n\\n\\nWill there be a cheaper Apple Vision Pro? \\nWe take the fact that the Vision Pro has the word \\u201cPro\\u201d in its name as a big hint that a more affordable version will be coming down the line. An \\u201cApple Vision Air,\\u201d if you will. \\nApple is thought to be working on two new Vision products: a refreshed high-end \\u201cPro\\u201d model with enhanced capabilities, and a more affordable model that Apple would aim to sell for a price similar to that of a high-end iPhone.\\n\\nNew rumors about the successor to Vision Pro \\u2013 both what it will be and when it will arrive \\u2013 change frequently. They all have one thing in common, though: there isn\\u2019t expected to be any new hardware in 2024. Bloomberg\\u2019s Mark Gurman believes that a cheaper headset will arrive in 2025. He reported in October 2023 that Apple is already working on the sequel to the headset, which will be cheaper than the original model.\\nIn June 2024 a report in The Information claimed that Apple had killed the development of the Vision Pro 2 in order to focus on a lower-cost headset for 2025. However, Apple is said to be struggling to bring down manufacturing costs without cutting back on features and performance too much.\\n\\n\\nThe Vision Pro is likely to follow the example of the HomePod with the expensive pro model paving the way for a cheaper option down the line. But it could be a while before the economies of scale and advancements in technology make a cheaper Apple Vision product viable.\\nApple Vision Pro: Compatibility \\nThe Vision Pro is its own product with its own software ecosystem. It has its own App Store, and runs software independent from other Apple products (though apps like Messages and Photos can sync via iCloud with your other Apple products).\\n\\nThere is support for iPad apps, however. By default, all iPad apps are made available for use on Vision Pro and can be found in the Vision Pro app store, but developers can opt not to allow their apps to be used on the device. White many iPad apps are available, prominent exceptions include YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix.\\nApple Vision Pro: Specs\\nThe Vision Pro is powered by an M2 processor with 8 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores\\u2013the same as you would find in a MacBook. It has 16GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of flash storage.\\n\\n\\nThere are 14 cameras on the inside and outside, a LiDAR scanner, multiple IR illuminators, an accelerometer, gyroscope, and multiple microphones. A custom R1 processor is made to process the vast amount of data from these sensors very quickly, for lightning-fast eye tracking and a delay for the video pass-through of only 12 milliseconds.\\nWhen wearing the Vision Pro you look through custom catadioptric pancake lenses at a pair of micro-OLED displays, one for each eye. About the size of a postage stamp, each of these displays has a stunning resolution of about 3,386 pixels per inch, more than 4K per eye. Of course, what matters is pixels per degree when looking through the lenses, which on Vision Pro is around 34 pixels per degree (less than you\\u2019d see looking at an iPhone display, but more than most other VR headsets).\\nApple does not disclose the field of view for the Vision Pro, but it appears to be somewhere around 110\\u00b0 horizontally and 90\\u00b0 vertically.\\nThe Vision Pro is actively cooled, with a fan inside, but the fan runs so quietly you can\\u2019t hear it.\\n\\n\\nThere are two individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod on the side of the headset near the headband connection. They deliver Personalized Spatial Audio based on the user\\u2019s own head and ear geometry. As a result, the sound feels like it is coming from the space around you. Vision Pro also matches the sound to the room using audio raytracing. \\nThe Vision Pro also recognizes the user\\u2019s iris via a new method to unlock the device and authenticate passwords and purchases called Optic ID. Like the iPhone and Mac, all data is stored on a dedicated Secure\\u00a0Enclave processor.  \\nOn the outside of the headset is an OLED display with a lenticular lens over it that Apple calls EyeSight. It projects a rendered image of your own eyes with correct perspective, so others can see you looking at them. If you are in a fully immersive environment and can\\u2019t see anyone, the EyeSight display shows a blueish haze.\\nBattery life \\nApple Vision Pro connects to an external battery via a custom tether, and the battery lasts for around 2 to 2.5 hours. The battery pack has a USB-C port that can only be used to recharge it, though you can use the Vision Pro with the battery plugged in.\\n\\n\\nWeight and dimensions\\nAccording to Apple Vision Pro tech specs, the headset weighs 21.2 to 22.9 ounces (600 to 650 grams) depending on the Light Seal and headband configuration. That\\u2019s about the weight of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (24 ounces/682\\u00a0grams). It\\u2019s not necessarily heavier than other VR headsets but quite a bit heavier than the Meta Quest 3, which weighs 18.2 ounces (516 grams).\\nThe weight is very front-heavy, mostly in the metal and glass out in the front of the face seal instead of distributed around the sides. The battery pack weighs 12.5 ounces (353 grams). \\nApple Vision Pro: Hands-on and overall experience\\nIn our Apple Vision Pro review, we found the technology very impressive, but the comfort and software\\u2014both apps and operating system\\u2014quite limited. There\\u2019s a lot of potential there, but it will take quite a while for the software to mature enough to unlock it, and for most users, the Vision Pro will never be worth the price. \\nWith a Vision Pro headset users will be able to watch a movie, listen to music, browse photos, look at 3D objects, and even collaborate on a presentation. \\n\\n\\nUsers experience a three-dimensional interface and input system that they control with their eyes, hands, and voice. You select things by looking at them and pinching your fingers together, then dragging objects around or flicking your hand to scroll. A virtual keyboard is used to enter text where appropriate, either by poking at the keys or looking at each key in succession and pinching your fingers together. You can also use voice input to enter text, or a Bluetooth keyboard.\\nApple has posted a 10-minute guided tour explaining how navigation and gestures work as well as several apps.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\n\\nApple\\n\\n\\nApple\\nWhen you first put on Vision Pro you see your surroundings. You can freely move apps to fill the space around you and they can expand into your space. The digital crown lets you adjust the volume or the degree of immersion in your environment\\u2013from fully immersed in a virtual space to seeing \\u201cpass-through\\u201d video of your own space. Here\\u2019s a primer on what the Vision Pro buttons do.\\nA user can bring a Mac wirelessly into the Apple Vision Pro space just by looking at it and choosing to connect to it if it is logged into the same Apple ID. The Mac display will blank out and be replaced by a big 4K virtual display in your Vision Pro environment; you\\u2019ll continue to use the Mac keyboard and touchpad, however, and audio will still play from the Mac.\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro: Software and apps\\nThe Vision Pro headset runs visionOS, an operating system that Apple has designed from the ground up for visual computing. Apple launched a number of native Vision Pro versions of its apps at launch, such as Safari, Messages, and FaceTime. Apple launched Vision Pro with more than 600 optimized apps. The latest version is visionOS 1.1, which includes support for managed profiles, improved Personas, and lots of bug fixes and minor improvements.\\nIn fall 2024, Apple will release visionOS 2, the first major update to the OS. It will bring numerous refinements and upgrades, including the ability to transform regular, 2D photos into spatial photos, and wide and ultra-wide screen views with Mac Virtual Display.\\nApple Vision Pro: Glossary and terminology\\nAs with many Apple products, the company has some of its own branding around things that may be better understood by other names. Here are some of the things you may see associated with Vision Pro and what they mean.\\nSpatial Computing: Computing that appears to happen in the environment around you rather than inside a computer (or phone). A sort of umbrella term that encapsulates AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality), and MR (Mixed Reality). It is not inaccurate to call Vision Pro a mixed-reality headset.\\n\\n\\nSpatial apps: Apps designed with the Vision Pro hardware in mind, as opposed to iPad apps running in a window. Some Spatial apps are fully immersive experiences, others are almost indistinguishable from iPad apps.\\nFully immersive: A \\u201cfully immersive\\u201d experience is one in which your surroundings are not visible: you\\u2019re completely surrounded in a virtual environment. In other words Virtual Reality.\\nSpatial Audio: Audio that seems to come from specific places in your environment. \\nPersona: A 3D digital recreation of you, created by scanning your face using the Vision Pro cameras. It is meant to be used to represent you in video conferencing apps like FaceTime or Zoom since the Vision Pro has no cameras that can actually see your face (just specialized internal cameras for eye tracking).\\n\\n\\nSpatial Video: A new 3D video format that can be captured with either the Vision Pro or an iPhone 15 Pro. Spatial Videos can be viewed using a Vision Pro or even a Quest headset, and look a bit like a 3D diorama of a memory. It\\u2019s an emotionally charged and effective way of capturing the moment.\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tMacworld is your best source for all things Apple.

Overnight, topics relating to race, gender, and the legacies of racism and sexism became fraught within school districts throughout the country. Teachers who covered these grounds in their classrooms questioned if and when they might be called to an administrative office and told their services were no longer needed.\\nThe presiding judge, Paul Barbadoro, noted in\\u00a0his decision that the New Hampshire law \\u201cforce[s] teachers to guess as to which diversity efforts can be touted and which must be repudiated, gambling with their careers in the process.\\u201d\\nThis resulted both in self-censorship and the enforcement by school districts of precautionary censorship to avoid legal jeopardy.\\nBooks were taken off classroom shelves out of fear of violating the law. The New Hampshire Department of Education created a\\u00a0portal for reporting teachers who dared to speak up for honest, fact-based histories. A bounty was issued with a $500 reward for the first person to report a teacher.\\nDespite the obstacles, many teachers taught the truth and spoke out to news media, in writing, and through informal groups. These teachers did not conform under the immense pressure of the law. Others simply left the profession\\u2014a protest in itself.\\nAs similar laws spread across the country, teachers partnered with the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center to challenge the constitutionality of such measures. In Rhode Island, a law was defeated in committee, and in Arizona, it was struck down by the State Supreme Court. In Georgia, on the other hand, a law has been fully enacted, and one educator was fired for reading the children\\u2019s book My Shadow Is Purple to her class.\\nAssessing the varied legal strategies, Professor Derek Black of the University of South Carolina stated in 2023 that he believed the arguments addressing the chilling effect of the laws on teachers\\u2019 free speech presented the strongest cases for combatting \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d laws.\\nBlack\\u2019s analysis was prescient in New Hampshire, where Thurgood Marshall\\u2019s dissent in\\u00a0Arnett v. Kennedy held sway. Marshall had written in 1974, \\u201cFor every employee who risks his job by testing the limits of the statute, many more will choose the cautious path and not speak at all.\\u201d In the \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d case, the judge concluded that the vaguely worded statute provided no clear guideline for determining what kind of educational efforts were allowed or prohibited, leaving district administrators to err on the side of an overly broad application of the law, not knowing when an accusation of a violation might surface. All of this adds tremendous strain on our profession and public schools, arguably the central institutions of our communities.\\nThe ruling could bode well for Oklahoma, where the primary argument for striking down \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d was based on the vagueness of the law. Yet the positive outcome in New Hampshire comes with a warning: There\\u2019s still a possibility that the legislature could address the issue of vagueness with more direct language aimed at limiting speech on topics related to race and gender.\\nLike other states that have passed corrosive laws targeting public schools, New Hampshire must now decide the kind of civic culture we want to have today and for the next generation.\\nOur small state has long received outsized attention due to hosting the first primary election in the nation. As such, New Hampshire takes its role in the process of picking a President seriously. From the tiny hamlet of Dixville Notch down to Manchester and many small towns in between, there is a sense of civic pride in asking candidates tough questions. There is also a strong sense of pride in each of our local public schools\\u2014a trust in the professionalism and experience of our neighbors who teach.\\nThe ban on books and teaching honest history was anathema to the civic culture of New Hampshire. Or at least it put a dent in what many of us saw as our down-to-earth civic sensibility. We understood Florida, Texas, and Oklahoma had similar bills. But could it be that the politically purple Granite State could have such censorship? The answer was clear: It could and did happen here. And it would have continued to happen here had it not been for a federal judge.\\nAll of this is noteworthy in determining whether New Hampshire becomes a bellwether in the campaign for reaffirming a national commitment to a democratic, pluralistic civil society. We have seen laws that attempt to limit teaching and learning\\u2014a departure from the principle of the classroom being a \\u201cmarketplace of ideas.\\u201d We have also seen the shortcomings of past curricula that left important stories untold. This brings us to a moment where we all have a collective choice: recommit to the project or backslide on affirming the promise of a more perfect union.\\nThe long awaited win in federal court provides hope for educators. That hope is most palpably felt in my home state of New Hampshire, but educators across the United States should take it to heart. It is the hard work of educators who choose to teach the truth and to speak up for what\\u2019s right that creates the foundation of civic life and the potential for civic renewal. But the promise of liberty and justice for all takes all of us working together\\u2014victory over \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d legislation is a chance to improve how we do democracy and support learning for each and every student. We cannot afford to waste this opportunity.\\n\\nJacob Goodwin is a sixth grade social studies teacher and the 2021 New Hampshire History Teacher of the Year.\\n\\n\\nMonthly Review does not necessarily adhere to all of the views conveyed in articles republished at MR Online.

The bear was the creation of plant and flower nursery, E. Smith and Son, based in Lymm in Cheshire, and appeared in the BBC North West Tonight garden in 2003.But since late founder, Edwin Smith, created it the frame for the Children In Need mascot display had been left to the elements behind a shed. His son, Derek Smith, has got Pudsey in shape and it is ready to feature again this year. The late Edwin Smith pictured with his creation back in 2003Edwin died in 2018, but his son said he would have been \\\"absolutely made up\\\" to see his creation back in Tatton. Mr Smith told the BBC: \\\"We have kept him all these years never knowing that we would ever use him again. \\\"But it's really fantastic to get him out and get him replanted.\\\"He said Pudsey's metal frame had been \\\"hiding behind the shed\\\" for the past two decades and had not been \\\"well-looked after\\\". However, Mr Smith said it was still in good shape which was \\\"testament to the work of my father\\\". How the re-constructed plant-based Pudsey looks nowAfter a call from a BBC producer about five weeks ago, he said his enthusiasm was \\\"re-fired\\\" and the beloved bear was rescued and re-planted. Despite the challenges of such a short time-frame, the bear is now in fine shape thanks to Mr Smith's staff, including his daughter, Rachel. Rachel, who tried her best to help as a toddler in 2003, said her grandad \\\"would have been thrilled\\\" to see the bear back on display. Mr Smith said his father did \\\"lots of fantastic things\\\" for the Tatton show over the years. \\\"His legacy lives on in Pudsey,\\\" he added.

There also were more word mix-ups, which have become characteristic of Mr. Biden\\u2019s public addresses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen it came time to answer a question about Vice President Kamala Harris possibly succeeding him on the ticket, he identified her as \\u201cVice President Trump.\\u201d\\nHe said, \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t have picked her if she wasn\\u2019t qualified to be president.\\u201d\\nMr. Biden was criticized for his gaffes, including by former President Donald Trump, who blasted him on his social media site for mixing him up with Ms. Harris.\\nBiden aides praised his performance, which they said showcased his command of foreign affairs.\\n\\u201cTo answer the question on everyone\\u2019s minds: No, Joe Biden does not have a doctorate in foreign affairs,\\u201d White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates posted on X. \\u201cHe\\u2019s just that f\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 good.\\u201d\\nThe press conference focused mostly on his fitness for the job and whether he should run for another term.\\nThe president said he would take a cognitive test, but only if his doctor ordered one, and denied needing to go to bed early despite reports that he told Democratic governors he needed to retire at 8 p.m.\\nHe explained that \\u201cit would be smarter to pace myself a little more\\u201d and not be on the job from early in the morning until very late at night.\\n\\u201cMy schedule has been full bore,\\u201d Mr. Biden added, taking a swipe at his opponent.\\n\\u201cWhere has Trump been? Riding around in his golf cart, filling out his scorecard before he hits the ball? I always have an inclination, just to keep going, not stopping. I\\u2019ve just got to pace myself a little more,\\u201d Mr. Biden said.\\nHe stumbled over questions about U.S. weapons being used by Ukraine to strike Russia, telling reporters, \\u201cour military is working on following the advice of my commander in chief, my, my chief of staff of the military, as well as the secretary of defense and our intelligence people\\u201d when it comes to U.S. involvement.\\nHe attempted to navigate a question about how he would handle the growing alliance between Russia and China, but part of it was rambling.\\nHe answered a follow-up question about whether he would be capable of negotiating face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin or Chinese President Xi Jinping in two or three years.\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m ready to deal with them now and three years from now. Like I said, I\\u2019m dealing with Xi right now, in direct contact with him. I have no good reason to talk to Putin right now. There isn\\u2019t any world leader I\\u2019m not prepared to deal with. I\\u2019m not ready to talk to Putin unless Putin is ready to change his behavior,\\u201d he said.\\nHe also highlighted his efforts to assist civilians in Gaza while Israel roots out Hamas militants who attacked their country on Oct. 7.\\nThe president took questions from the press in a bid to prove his cognitive mettle after a disastrous debate performance two weeks ago and amid increasing calls from within his own party for him to quit the race and hand the baton, presumably to Ms. Harris.\\nThe president arrived at the press conference after a bad stumble at NATO, right in front of world leaders gathered in Washington where he has worked this week to prove he is a capable leader.\\nAfter a day of talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Mr. Biden introduced him as \\u201cPresident Putin,\\u201d the Russian president who invaded his country.\\nMr. Biden immediately corrected and attempted to explain himself, but the gaffe exploded on social media and led the evening news, adding to Mr. Biden\\u2019s struggle to prove he is cognitively fit for office.\\nHe is facing rising pressure from Democrats to move aside for Ms. Harris or another Democratic candidate ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which begins on Aug. 19.\\nSenate Democrats met with Biden staffers Thursday on Capitol Hill and left no more confident that Mr. Biden could pull off a win against Mr. Trump.\\n\\nA Washington Post/Ipsos poll released Thursday showed Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump tied nationally, which has largely been the case for months. But the same poll showed two-thirds of Americans believe Mr. Biden should not run for reelection, including three-quarters of critical independents and more than half of all Democrats.\\n\\n\\u2022 Susan Ferrechio can be reached at sferrechio@washingtontimes.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 The Washington Times, LLC. \\n                        \\n                          Click\\n                            here for reprint permission.\\n\\nPlease read\\n  our comment policy before commenting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Click to Read More and View Comments\\n                    \\n Click to Hide \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch\\nSearch Keyword:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Search\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Advertisement\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Advertisement\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nFront Page Podcast\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommentary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nClifford D.

The technology giant has smashed the global record for quarterly profits after racking up a surplus of 18 billion US dollars (\\u00a311.9 billion). (PA Archive)Apple has launched its \\u201cmost advanced\\u201d smartphone yet with the iPhone 14, which features battery life and camera upgrades over its predecessor.Its four new models are between 6.1 and 6.7 inches in length, meaning they have larger screens than the iPhone 13, while lasting all day on a single charge.However, one expert noted that Apple had reserved the \\u201cbiggest leaps\\u201d \\u2013 such as a more powerful processor \\u2013 for the Pro, its more expensive handset.The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus feature an upgraded 12MP camera, while the Pro and Pro Max have a 48MP camera.All are equipped with a larger light sensor which can produce low-light photographs twice the previous generation\\u2019s quality.\\u201cLow-light photography has always been a challenge given the sensor size in mobile phones,\\u201d Ru Bhikha, mobiles expert at Uswitch.com, told the PA news agency.\\u201cSo any sort of improvements there, given the amount of pictures we take on a daily basis, will definitely be seen as a worthy upgrade compared to the iPhone 13.\\u201dMeet iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Ultra, and AirPods Pro. All that and more from the #AppleEvent\\u2014 Apple (@Apple) September 7, 2022However, while the standard iPhone 14 uses its predecessor\\u2019s A15 bionic chip, the Pro will be equipped with the faster A16 chip.\\u201cApple has stuck to its guns and reserved its biggest leaps in innovation for its most premium handsets, despite the economic challenges facing many consumers,\\u201d Mr Bikha noted.Similarly, the Pro versions boast an \\u201cAlways-On Display\\u201d, meaning users can see basic notifications while the screen is locked.Unveiling the feature at a virtual event, Apple executive Greg Joswiack said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s easy to see the time and other core information without raising your iPhone or tapping the display.\\u201cThis keeps the central information available for the moments where all you need is just a glance\\u2026 this is the most advanced display we\\u2019ve ever shipped.\\u201dMr Joswiack added that it was made possible by the Pro\\u2019s \\u201cincredibly power-efficient\\u201d display, which operates with a refresh rate as low as 1Hz.Apple has ditched the iPhone mini seen in previous generations \\u2013 the \\u201ccheapest and most pocket-friendly phone from the main series\\u201d, Mr Bikha said.The virtual event also saw the unveiling of the Apple Watch Ultra, which the company\\u2019s chief operating officer Jeff Williams labelled \\u201cthe most rugged and capable Apple Watch yet\\u201d.It is aimed at those taking part in extreme sports \\u2013 such as deep-sea diving \\u2013 and is fortified by titanium casing and a sapphire crystal display protector.The iPhone 14 will be available for \\u00a3849 on September 16, while the Plus will appear on shelves for \\u00a3949 on October 7.The Pro and Pro Max retail for \\u00a31,099 and \\u00a31,199 on September 16 and 23.Up nextUp nextUp nextUp nextLatest StoriesUSA TODAY OpinionThe Florida judge who just gave Trump a pass in documents case will now be judged herselfU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon's ruling has nothing to do with the merits of Trump's classified documents case.HuffPostVan Jones Thinks This Celebrity\\u2019s RNC Speech Was \\u2018Most Dangerous\\u2019 For Democrats\\u201cShe\\u2019s way more famous than any of us up here,\\u201d said the CNN commentator, describing it as a \\u201cbunker buster\\u201d address.

This article has covered observations made by analysts at IDC and Omdia on the recent developments in the XR industry.\\nDespite a projected stagnation in near-eye display shipments for 2024, the long-term outlook for the market remains positive, Kimi Lin said in a recent Omdia report.\\n\\u201cWith advancements in display, optical, and other component technologies, Omdia is optimistic about the long-term outlook. Near-eye display shipments are projected to grow rapidly from 2027, reaching 92.9 million units by 2030,\\u201d stated Kimi Lin, Senior Research Analyst at Omdia.\\nThe global display industry is set to convene at the Omdia Display Conference from September 12-13, 2024, in Shanghai, China. During the event, Kimi Lin and a team of Omdia analysts will present their research on the latest innovations within the display sector.\\nXR market\\nThe XR market, which includes AR, VR, and MR, is currently facing a downturn, causing significant layoffs at leading companies and prompting several smartphone brands to halt or scale back their XR projects. Despite these setbacks, industry leaders are determined to rejuvenate the market and drive growth in the coming years, Omdia said.\\nFor instance, Microsoft announced layoffs primarily targeting its mixed reality (MR unit, responsible for the HoloLens 2 AR headset.\\nTechnology major Google is cutting hundreds of jobs in its AR (Augmented Reality) hardware and voice assistant businesses, according to reports.\\nAnother tech giant Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs in 2023.\\nChina-based ByteDance-owned virtual reality (VR) headset maker Pico is conducting a new round of\\u00a0job cuts\\u00a0in line with a restructuring.\\nThe latest IDC report said global shipments of augmented reality and virtual reality (AR VR) headsets fell 67.4 percent in the first quarter of 2024 as the market is transitioning to include new categories such as Mixed Reality (MR) and Extended Reality (ER).\\n\\nThe average selling price (ASP) of AR and VR headsets rose to over $1000 as Apple entered the market and incumbents such as Meta focused on premium headsets such as the Quest 3.\\nVirtual Reality headsets are forecast to reach 24.7 million units by the end of 2028, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.2 percent as the consumer base slowly grows beyond core gaming use cases and as businesses adopt more headsets for training, design, and more.\\nAugmented Reality headsets will grow from a smaller base of less than a million units in 2024 to 10.9 million in 2028, representing an 87.1 percent CAGR over the same period, Jitesh Ubrani, research manager,\\u00a0Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers\\u00a0at IDC, said.\\nGrowth plans\\nMeta and PICO plan to launch the Quest 3S and PICO 4S in the second half of 2024, both at lower prices than their predecessors to stimulate sales. Meanwhile, Sony\\u2019s PlayStation VR2 (PS VR2) will now support PC VR games, expanding beyond its previous PS5 exclusivity, which is anticipated to boost PS VR2 sales, Omdia said.\\nIDC report on share of AR VR vendors Q1 2024\\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms has announced the initial release of its XR operating systems to third-party OEMs, including ASUS, Lenovo, and Microsoft Xbox. Meta will also focus on enhancing the quality and quantity of its platform and application software to improve hardware terminal sales.\\nIn 2024, the XR market\\u2019s primary focus will be on the Apple Vision Pro. Its high price is expected to limit its sales, preventing it from significantly boosting overall market growth.\\nOmdia predicts that total XR set shipments in 2024 will remain steady compared to 2023, with near-eye display shipments also flat at 17.2 million units. Nonetheless, the Vision Pro has significantly increased the share of OLED on silicon (OLEDoS) displays.\\nThe XR industry is expected to remain stagnant for the next one to two years. While set shipments will experience slight fluctuations, near-eye display shipments are projected to increase more significantly due to the inevitable shift from single to dual displays.\\nBaburajan Kizhakedath\\nTweetShareSharePin\\n\\nPrevious articleEricsson posts 7% drop in sales to $5.7 bn in second-quarterNext articleTPG Telecom and Optus network sharing deal faces review in Australia\\n\\n\\nLatest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAT&T faces questions from senators over cyber-attack affecting 109 mn\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTRAI report highlights poor demand for 5G in India\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIndia telecoms poised for ARPU growth with tariff hike and data surge\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nUK regulators probe Big Tech\\u2019s growing influence in digital payment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSK Telecom to invest $200 mn in SMART Global in AI push\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore like thisRelated\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nUK regulators probe Big Tech\\u2019s growing influence in digital payment\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 16, 2024 \\n\\nBritish regulators are investigating the increasing use of digital...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nApple sale in India reaches $8 bn in 2023-24 fiscal\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 15, 2024 \\n\\nApple has generated sales of almost $8 billion in...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSmartphone market growth and leading vendors in second-quarter\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 15, 2024 \\n\\nIDC and Canalys have shared the growth trends in...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nOppo signs global patent cross license agreement with Ericsson\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 15, 2024 \\n\\nOppo, one of the leaders in the smartphone business,...\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nABOUT US\\nPARTNERSHIP\\nPRIVACY POLICY\\nCONTACT US\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNews website for 4G, 5G, Statistics, Telecom Services, Internet, Broadband, Broadcast, Network, Chips, and Smartphones.\\n\\n\\nFacebookLinkedinTwitter\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nABOUT US\\nPARTNERSHIP\\nPRIVACY POLICY\\nCONTACT US\\n\\n\\nThe latest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAT&T faces questions from senators over cyber-attack affecting 109 mn\\n\\nTelecom Services\\n\\nJuly 17, 2024 0 \\n\\nTwo U.S. senators have demanded answers from AT&T regarding...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTRAI report highlights poor demand for 5G in India\\n\\n5G\\n\\nJuly 16, 2024 0 \\n\\nThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has released...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nIndia telecoms poised for ARPU growth with tariff hike and data surge\\n\\nTelecom Services\\n\\nJuly 16, 2024 0 \\n\\nIndian telecom companies are set to see a substantial...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a9 2024 Kizhakedath Media Services.

         Credit: OMNIVISION\\r\\n                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntended for eye and face tracking in AR/VR/MR consumer headsets and glasses it is the first time that OMNIVISION has brought its patented DCG high dynamic range (HDR) technology to the AR/VR/MR market in the 2.2-micron (\\u00b5m) pixel OG0TC GS image sensor.\\nWith a package size of just 1.64mm x 1.64mm, the device is an ultra-small and low-power image sensor that\\u2019s intended for optimising primarily inward-facing tracking cameras.

(Image: Facebook0Mumbai: Amidst the growing controversy over wagh nakh (tiger claw-shaped weapon) used by Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj to kill Mughal general Afzal Khan, Maharashtra minister Sudhir Mungantiwar on Thursday reiterated that the historic weapon was indeed used by the Maratha king. He denied the claims made by historian Indrajit Sawant that the Victoria and Albert Museum in London has said there is no evidence the wagh nakh (in its possession) belongs to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj.Making a statement in the legislative assembly on Thursday, Mr. Mungantiwar said, \\u201cThe government decided to bring wagh nakh after \\u201cShiv Premi\\u201d (devotees of Shivaji) made the demand. We also received documents and records from them insisting that wagh nakh used by Shivaji Maharaj to kill Afzan Khan in 1659 were in the London Museum. We wrote letters to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the UK PM and the museum clearly stating that we wish to bring wagh nakh used by Shivaji Maharaj to India. We received a response from the museum, which specified that wagh nakh in their possession were used by Shivaji Maharaj against Mughal general.\\u201dMr. Sawant has claimed that the Victoria and Albert Museum has said there is no evidence the wagh nakh (in its possession) belongs to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj. He has also alleged that the state government is bringing the historic weapon on a loan agreement of Rs 30 crore for three years.Responding to Mr. Sawant\\u2019s claim, the minister said, \\u201cThe museum has never said that.\\u201d He also denied that the government is spending Rs 30 crore. He informed the House that the total expenses were Rs. 14.08 lakh including the travel expenses and signing of the agreement. \\u201cThe wagh nakh will be kept on display at the government museum in Satara in the presence of the descendants of the warrior king on July 19,\\u201d he said.( Source : Deccan Chronicle with agency inputs )Wagh Nakhe (tiger claws)\\u00a0chhatrapati shivaji maharaj\\u00a0sudhir mungantiwar\\u00a0Rest of India\\u00a0Maharashtra\\u00a0Mumbai (Bombay)\\u00a0About the AuthorDC CorrespondentLatest News   Next StoryX\",\n        \"type\": \"Document\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"lc\": 1,\n      \"type\": \"constructor\",\n      \"id\": [\n        \"langchain\",\n        \"schema\",\n        \"document\",\n        \"Document\"\n      ],\n      \"kwargs\": {\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"source\": \"https://baodanang.vn/english/culture-sport/202407/diff-2024-finale-expects-thrilling-competition-between-china-and-finland-3977855/\",\n          \"title\": \"DIFF 2024 finale expects thrilling competition between China and Finland - Da Nang English- News - eNewspaper\",\n          \"description\": \"China's Liuyang Lingduan New-art Display Co, and Finland's Joho Pyro Professional Fireworks AB will compete at the finale of ...\\n\\n  Da Nang English- News - eNewspaper\",\n          \"language\": \"vi\"\n        },\n        \"page_content\": \"\\n\\n\\nDIFF 2024 finale expects thrilling competition between China and Finland - Da Nang English- News - eNewspaper\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n272\\n5879\\n1041\\nCulture - Sports\\nculture-sport\\n/culture-sport/\\n1450003\\nDIFF 2024 finale expects thrilling competition between China and Finland\\n1\\nArticle\\n\\nnull\\n\\n\\n\\n.\\nCulture - Sports\\n\\nDIFF 2024 finale expects thrilling competition between China and Finland\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBy DA NANG Today / DA NANG Today\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJuly      11, 2024, 12:03 [GMT+7]China's Liuyang Lingduan New-art Display Co, and Finland's Joho Pyro Professional Fireworks AB will compete at the finale of the Da Nang International Fireworks Festival (DIFF) 2024 themed \\\"Made of Young Generation\\\" on the evening of July 13. They promise to bring to people and tourists the most exciting finale of DIFF seasons.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite the hot weather, both Chinese and Finnish teams have been working hard to prepare for the final night. IN PHOTO: The fireworks team from China is installing fireworks at the yard. Photo: THU HA\\n\\n\\n\\nThe competition is equal in talent and strength\\nCurrently, the preparatory works for the forthcoming grand finale by the two fireworks teams have been basically completed.\\nMr. Johan Dan Erik Hollaender, leader of the Finnish fireworks team, revealed that his team will adhere to the general theme of DIFF 2024 \\\"Made in Unity - Global Connection - Radiant Five Continents\\u201d.\\n\\u201cWe are determined to bring an explosive and impressive performance with the overwhelming red colour of fireworks. With the theme of \\\"Made of Young Generation\\\", we want to bring to the audience a performance prepared from the team's heart, mixed with many different emotions and the most positive energy\\u201d he added.\\nThe Finnish fireworks team will continue to show their inherent style in their display in the qualifying round. In the technical part, the team will demonstrate from many different angles including high-altitude, low-altitude, and on the water surface. As for music, they will take the audience through many levels of emotions with different musical works and then will conclude the performance with the hope that everyone will live in happiness and peace.\\n\\u201cWe have been working very hard to design displays of different types of fireworks with lots of different effects. By using about 10,000 firecrackers of all kinds, the team are determined to bring a show that is more perfect and impressive than the previous one\\u201d Mr. Johan Dan Erik Hollaender shared.\\nMeanwhile, members of the fireworks team from China are all diligently preparing for their performance in the grand finale.\\nMr. Liang Weiming, leader of the Liuyang Jingduan New-art Display Co fireworks team from China, couldn't hide his joy after his team entered the finale at their debut at the DIFF. Therefore, the whole team was very excited to plan carefully and confidently for the upcoming performance night. At the finale, the team will bring a difference in their performance by combining Eastern and Western music to draw the audience's attention.\\nThe leader of the Chinese fireworks team voiced his hope that the careful combination of music and fireworks promised to bring the most wonderful moments to the audience.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFireworks team members from Finland are preparing for their performance in the final competition night. Photo: THU HA\\n\\n\\n\\nTeams\\u2019 commitment to return to Da Nang\\nAccording to Mr. Hollaender, the final night of DIFF 2024 will be a competition of equal talent and strength between the two teams.\\n\\u201cIt is difficult to predict the final results because of two different performance styles. However, I think that the two teams are the winners and most importantly, they bring very satisfying and impressive fireworks shows to the audience in Da Nang\\\" Mr. Johan Dan Erik Hollaender said.\\nHaving attended many DIFFs, Mr. Johan Dan Erik Hollaender always feels very comfortable when coming to Da Nang. He shared that he was always full of surprises at the larger scale and professionalism of the festival whenever he returned to the central coastal city.\\n\\u201cWe hope the festival will always maintain its quality and develop more each year. If we have the opportunity, we still want to come back and try to bring different performances to the audience in Da Nang\\\" he expressed.\\nSharing the same opinion, Mr. Liang Weiming highly appreciated the scale of DIFF 2024 as well as the quality of the participating teams. He underlined that his team had great experiences at DIFF 2024. He also affirmed that the warm welcome of the organisers and local people was the motivation for the team members to prepare their best for the final night. \\u201cIf we are given the opportunity, we will continue to return to DIFF\\u201d he noted.\\nMs. Nadia Shakira Wong, the Director of Global 2000 Company, the consulting unit for DIFF 2024, said that all preparations for the finale have been being carried out very well. She added the final competition night was really a challenge for the Finnish and Chinese teams because they only had two weeks to design and prepare for their shows instead of four months in the qualifying rounds.\\nMs. Nadia Shakira Wong further informed that DIFF was increasingly growing stronger and attracted the attention of fireworks teams around the world. The fireworks teams highly appreciated and wanted to participate in the festival whilst the audience did not know which night to choose to watch because every performance night was amazing.\\n\\u201cIt is very difficult to judge which team is stronger than the other because the Chinese and Finnish teams are both very excellent. Every team has a different style and they shine in their own way. The team has strengths in music, and the other has a very beautiful performance design. This causes many difficulties for the judges in scoring and choosing the best team. But I believe, the jury will find the best element of the 2024 DIFF season\\u201d Ms. Nadia Shakira Wong emphasised.\\nReporting by THU HA, VAN HOANG - Translating by M.DUNG, T.

the Volvo Car UK Heritage Fleet is a model 144E from 1974.\\nOriginally in production as one of Volvo\\u2019s volume marques in 1966 the car continued in various model forms and was sold all the way through until the early 1990s.\\nThis exciting loan was arranged by Mike Trigg, Van Mossel Esplanade\\u2019s resident Volvo Master Technician.\\nMike collected the car from Volvo Southampton and before putting on display in the showroom he took it on a tour of the Island.\\n\\nMike said:\\n\\\"I really enjoy classic cars and Volvo have done such a great job in curating a collection of restored older models. \\n\\\"It was interesting but fun to drive. \\n\\\"The steering wheel is very thin compared to that of a modern car and amazingly the air-conditioning is still in full working order! \\nThis 144E is not only a lovely example of classic car with an interesting history but also a great illustration of the quality that has always been associated with Volvo cars.\\\"\\nWith a unique provenance this car was originally the property of the late Mr Leslie Charteris who wrote the \\u2018Saint\\u2019 novels.\\nThey were successfully turned into the TV series starting Roger Moore and the famous Volvo P1800 \\u2018ST1\\u2019 which helped promote the brand worldwide.\\nOrdered to a high specification this model 144E has some unique features for the period including air conditioning, heated rear window and a twin fog light grille.\\nWhen he passed away Mr Charteris gifted the 144E to his chauffeur who couldn\\u2019t bear to use it.\\nHe put it into long term storage in the early 90\\u2019s after only 33,400 miles of usage.\\nCurrently it is the only 144E recorded by the DVLA as being roadworthy.\\nAs the only approved retailer and repairer for Volvo on the Isle of Wight, Van Mossel Esplanade would like to invite anyone wishing to see this unique classic car to their premises.\\nThe showroom can be found at Airfield Way, Cowes, PO31 8BF and is open Monday to Saturday with plenty of parking.\\n\\n\\nShare\\n\\n\\n\\nShare on Facebook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare on Messenger\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare on Messenger\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare on X\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare

Former rivals of Donald J. Trump, such as Nikki Haley, came forward to pledge their support. The Republican Party showcased confidence in its fate for the upcoming November elections by emphasizing an aggressive law-and-order message.Throughout the Trump era, there has been a divisive tone between the supporters of Mr. Trump and everyone else. However, the Make America Great Again movement inherently embodies unity, despite not being recognized by the news media and the Democratic Party elites. While the past strategy involved pitting members of the movement against others to secure a win, the current political climate seems to be shifting towards portraying Trumpism as a movement for all Americans, whether they realize it or not.Senator Marco Rubio of Florida closed the night by highlighting that Americans supporting the movement are not hateful or extreme. They simply desire good jobs, lower prices, secure borders, legal immigration, safety from criminals and terrorists, and a focus on domestic issues rather than foreign affairs. This message aimed to show the unifying aspects of the movement.The main theme of the night was unity, with a visual representation of loyalty. Former rivals of Mr. Trump, including Vivek Ramaswamy, Senator Ted Cruz, former Gov. Nikki Haley, Gov. Ron DeSantis, and Senator Marco Rubio, all expressed their allegiance to the former president. This display of support was a stark contrast to the tensions seen during the 2016 convention, particularly when Senator Cruz did not endorse Mr. Trump. This time, Mr. Cruz thanked God for protecting President Trump, which was met with a smile from the former president.The night showcased a united front within the Republican Party, highlighting the support and loyalty towards Donald J. Trump. The message of unity and common goals resonated throughout the event, emphasizing the importance of coming together for the upcoming elections. The Republican National Convention served as a platform to solidify the party\\u2019s stance on key issues and to demonstrate a unified front in the face of opposition.

The knockout game was a head-to-head race until just before the end, when Ollie Watkins, who had been substituted, rescued the Three Lions and their fans with the winning goal. Hundreds of kilometers away in Dortmund, The Killers were performing a concert in London.The Killers show England's semifinal win on stageAs numerous videos on X, formerly Twitter, show, the concertgoers didn't have to miss the game. The band showed the last minutes of the match, during which the English national team fought for a place in the final. The fans of the Rockband watched intently on a large screen. When Watkins' shot secured the EM-Final place, they cheered loudly \\u2013 and the Killers added to it.Without delay, they launched their biggest hit, \\\"Mr. Brightside\\\", in response to the jubilation of their and England's fans. The first notes of the worldwide hit were so recognizable that everyone in the hall knew what was coming next. The result: Complete ecstasy. Although \\\"Mr. Brightside\\\" originally deals with separation and hurt feelings, it has become one of the sing-along and party anthems in recent years.\\\"Today we played for England,\\\" the band wrote on X after the concert. \\\"It was absolutely brilliant. And football was a bonus, and 'Mr. Brightside' was the madness,\\\" an excited fan wrote.The English fans will have to tense up again on Sunday. They face Spain in the EM-Final in Berlin. And the Killers? They play the last concert of their Europe tour on Saturday \\u2013 coincidentally in Madrid.Ollie Watkins' winning goal during the semifinal match between England and the Netherlands was a highlight that even reached The Killers' concert in Dortmund. Despite being hundreds of kilometers away, fans watched the final minutes of the game on a large screen, cheering loudly as Watkins secured England's place in the EM-Final.After the goal, The Killers responded with their popular hit \\\"Mr. Brightside,\\\" which resonated with the jubilant crowd, despite the song's original theme of separation and hurt feelings.Read also:Caught up in the present: the end of \\\"The Crown\\\"Could a girl play every role despite her age not fitting the part?Through New Year's Eve with TV showsWhat's next for the series hits?\\n\\n\\nComments \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCulture\\n\\nSinger with stone on \\\"Walk of Fame\\\" honored\\nGelsenkirchen in Taylor-Swift-Fever: On the 'Walk of Fame' of the city, the singer temporarily has her own plaque.\\n\\n\\n,\\u00a0\\n\\u00a0and\\u00a0\\nKsenia Johnson\\n\\n\\n\\n2024 July 17\\n \\nPaid\\nMembers\\nPublic\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCulture\\n\\nEvery pendulum stroke costs 50 Euro: dealers bet rhythmically\\nBares for Rares - Every pendulum stroke costs 50 Euro: dealers bet rhythmically\\nDorothee Sudau and Liane Petersen from Hamburg brought a bracelet adorned with diamonds, named \\\"Bares fu\\u0308r Rares\\\", to the event.
