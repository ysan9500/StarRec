(Courtesy of Lauren Millet-Simpson) Horses have a funny way of keeping us on our toes, don\\u2019t they? Just when you think things are going one way, we constantly have to pivot another way.Our last update saw the big horse Mr Nobility getting ready to display his progress at the LongRun open house. Unfortunately, he had other plans. The day before the open house he had blood and mucus coming out of his nose. The next day, the morning of the open house, more mucus, coughing, and lots of blood pouring out of his nose. The veterinarian came out for an emergency endoscopy to see what was going on, and unfortunately didn\\u2019t really find much other than a very irritated soft palate and a lot of bloody mucus in the throat. Needless to say, we did not ride at the open house.\\t\\tMr Nobility naps in the weirdest places. (Courtesy of Lauren Millet-Simpson)\\tSince we are getting down to the wire as such, we really needed to start going off property and experimenting with different adventures. My coach booked a schooling time at a local show barn for myself and her other student who is going to the Makeover for an off-property ride.The week leading up to going off property was one of the most frustrating weeks for us in a while. Mr Nobility seemed for forget all manners and went back to his super studly behavior that I thought we had worked him out of. I think we maybe had five minutes of actual forward trot the entire week \\u2014 one day he was so completely ridiculous on the lunge I didn\\u2019t even get on him.I decided to throw him on the trailer anyway and that, at the absolute worst, he would walk around on a new farm and watch another horse working in the ring. I set my expectations six-feet underground so there was no way we could possibly fail!Once again, horses surprise us. He surprised everyone that day and was a very good 5-year-old for a lot of firsts.After walking around the arena for a while getting him used to the fact that another horse was working around him, and teaching him it\\u2019s OK to let the other horse canter by and not react whatsoever, Mr Nobility was level-headed enough to hop on. In my mind, this was already a victory as I truly thought I wouldn\\u2019t even get this far. He had never been in a ring with another horse and handled that well, anything else was bonus!He was good enough walking around that we did some trot work. He had issues circling to the right and steering was optional, but I chalked that up to inexperience, lots of distractions, and new things. Overall, he was being pretty good!My coach then set up a little X to jump over. He had never jumped before but she thought he was a horse who would thrive the more we asked of him \\u2026 and boy was she right! Once he fell over the X the first couple times and sent the poles flying, he learned to pick up his feet and ended the day jumping a little vertical with filler. He loved it! He actually paid attention and had better steering while jumping than flatting. Go figure!We have continued jumping in our lessons and he amazes me each time how much he enjoys it and how engaged he becomes. He is almost a completely different horse when a jump is front of him versus attempting to master a 20-meter circle while balanced and supple. We have now put four jumps together and done a flying change in a very short period of time! Not to mention his most balanced canter seems to be the first several strides after landing a jump.We have also discovered that his massive, teenage-boy growing body does require some maintenance as we transition into this new career. He is getting regular chiropractic treatments, which he responds really well to, and occasional osteopathy sessions.\\t\\tMr Nobility does not appreciate fly gear \\u2026 or flies. (Courtesy of Lauren Millet-Simpson)\\tAs with any athlete, it\\u2019s important to listen to the body and react appropriately when something is not 100%. Mr Nobility is a little bit like \\u201cprincess and the pea\\u201d and he makes no qualms about letting me know immediately when he needs a treatment. He is definitely expensive, but at least he is pretty!As we continue to progress toward (hopefully!) going to Kentucky in October, and I discover more and more about this wonderful creature, I am amazed at how much they also teach us about ourselves. After my accident a year and a half ago, when a horse I was riding tripped and fell and my leg got pinned underneath him, my confidence was definitely shaken. Prior to that, I would get on anything and not think twice about it. Now there exists a little voice in the back of my head that just adds a moment of hesitation when a horse is acting frisky or stubborn. But Mr Nobility, in all his 17 hands-plus of pure athlete, is re-teaching me to ride the big trot again and to not be afraid to trust in the foundation of my riding and the skills we have developed together. He is a really nice horse that I\\u2019m very lucky to be riding, and when we have those harmonious moments, it really is the most amazing feeling.I hope to take him to our first show in a few weeks and see what we have to work with. As with everything on this journey, I am expecting anything but smooth sailing, so stay tuned for our next update to find out what crazy things are thrown at us this time!The Jockey Club supports\\u00a0many\\u00a0aftercare initiatives\\u00a0including the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance, the only accrediting body in aftercare, and Thoroughbred Incentive Program (T.I.P.), which encourages the retraining of Thoroughbreds into other disciplines upon completion of careers.\\u00a0View all of the initiatives supported by The Jockey Club.Related News\\t\\t\\tmost popular\\t\\t\\tThis WeekThis MonthThis YearThorpedo Anna Scores Dominant Win in CCA Oaks, Travers May Be NextShareDornoch Takes Charge of 3-Year-Old Division with Haskell Stakes VictoryShareTale of the Tape: Leading Eclipse Award Contenders in 3-Year-Old Male DivisionShare Lady\\u2019s Secret: Horse Racing\\u2019s Iron LadyShareCol.

SUBMITTED PHOTOS       July 14, 2024    Local historian Paul Lovett, the Rehoboth Beach Museum and more than 100 guests celebrated the opening of the Golden Age of Rehoboth diorama exhibition June 20 in the museum's Bob & Dee Moore and Mr. and Mrs. E. Thomas Harvey III Upper Gallery.Lovett's miniature display of Rehoboth Avenue, set circa 1900, depicts a working locomotive and more than 60 handmade replicas of the homes and businesses that graced the Avenue during the railroad era, when visitors came to the beach by train. Realistic sound effects bring the display populated by tiny people in period dress to life. Visitors can press buttons that activate the train, a rotating merry-go-round, a working smokestack, and sounds of ocean waves, seagulls and church bells. With the lights lowered, the internally lighted buildings give visitors a sense of how Rehoboth appeared more than 100 years ago.Lovett said he is excited to have his work exhibited in the museum. This diorama is unique from train displays at other museums, because the buildings are historically accurate replicas of those that existed in early 1900s Rehoboth. The models are built by a professional model maker using specifications based on photographs and insurance maps. Because his grandparents purchased property along the canal in 1929, Lovett has come to the location where he now lives, next to the canal just across from the museum. He became obsessed with the town\\u2019s history when, at almost 70 years of age, he learned that a railroad bridge crossed the canal within a hundred yards of where he played on the canal bank in the early 1950s.Heidi Nasstrom Evans, the museum's executive director, welcomed guests and commented on fundraising plans to create a permanent display for the diorama, including interactive touchscreen technology for guests to explore its historical features. \\\"Tonight, Mr. Lovett and the museum wanted to let you know about these exciting plans and ask you to support them when the time comes so we may preserve the handmade diorama and have it available for you and your families, and their families to enjoy for generations to come.\\\"Attendees included several Rehoboth Beach Museum board members, city commissioners and the new city manager.Lovett will be offering scheduled presentations of the diorama throughout the summer; check the museum website,\\u00a0rehobothbeachmuseum.org, for times. He will also be giving three topical lectures on the history of railroad-era Rehoboth this summer. Reservations may be made on the museum website.\\u00a0The Rehoboth Beach Museum is at 511 Rehoboth Ave., Rehoboth Beach, near the Lewes-Rehoboth Canal and Grove Park.

Overnight, topics relating to race, gender, and the legacies of racism and sexism became fraught within school districts throughout the country. Teachers who covered these grounds in their classrooms questioned if and when they might be called to an administrative office and told their services were no longer needed.The presiding judge, Paul Barbadoro, noted in\\u00a0his decision that the New Hampshire law \\u201cforce[s] teachers to guess as to which diversity efforts can be touted and which must be repudiated, gambling with their careers in the process.\\u201dThis resulted both in self-censorship and the enforcement by school districts of precautionary censorship to avoid legal jeopardy.Books were taken off classroom shelves out of fear of violating the law. The New Hampshire Department of Education created a\\u00a0portal for reporting teachers who dared to speak up for honest, fact-based histories. A bounty was issued with a $500 reward for the first person to report a teacher.Despite the obstacles, many teachers taught the truth and spoke out to news media, in writing, and through informal groups. These teachers did not conform under the immense pressure of the law. Others simply left the profession\\u2014a protest in itself.As similar laws spread across the country, teachers partnered with the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center to challenge the constitutionality of such measures. In Rhode Island, a law was defeated in committee, and in Arizona, it was struck down by the State Supreme Court. In Georgia, on the other hand, a law has been fully enacted, and one educator was fired for reading the children\\u2019s book My Shadow Is Purple to her class.Assessing the varied legal strategies, Professor Derek Black of the University of South Carolina stated in 2023 that he believed the arguments addressing the chilling effect of the laws on teachers\\u2019 free speech presented the strongest cases for combatting \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d laws.Black\\u2019s analysis was prescient in New Hampshire, where Thurgood Marshall\\u2019s dissent in\\u00a0Arnett v. Kennedy held sway. Marshall had written in 1974, \\u201cFor every employee who risks his job by testing the limits of the statute, many more will choose the cautious path and not speak at all.\\u201d In the \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d case, the judge concluded that the vaguely worded statute provided no clear guideline for determining what kind of educational efforts were allowed or prohibited, leaving district administrators to err on the side of an overly broad application of the law, not knowing when an accusation of a violation might surface. All of this adds tremendous strain on our profession and public schools, arguably the central institutions of our communities.The ruling could bode well for Oklahoma, where the primary argument for striking down \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d was based on the vagueness of the law. Yet the positive outcome in New Hampshire comes with a warning: There\\u2019s still a possibility that the legislature could address the issue of vagueness with more direct language aimed at limiting speech on topics related to race and gender.Like other states that have passed corrosive laws targeting public schools, New Hampshire must now decide the kind of civic culture we want to have today and for the next generation.Our small state has long received outsized attention due to hosting the first primary election in the nation. As such, New Hampshire takes its role in the process of picking a President seriously. From the tiny hamlet of Dixville Notch down to Manchester and many small towns in between, there is a sense of civic pride in asking candidates tough questions. There is also a strong sense of pride in each of our local public schools\\u2014a trust in the professionalism and experience of our neighbors who teach.The ban on books and teaching honest history was anathema to the civic culture of New Hampshire. Or at least it put a dent in what many of us saw as our down-to-earth civic sensibility. We understood Florida, Texas, and Oklahoma had similar bills. But could it be that the politically purple Granite State could have such censorship? The answer was clear: It could and did happen here. And it would have continued to happen here had it not been for a federal judge.All of this is noteworthy in determining whether New Hampshire becomes a bellwether in the campaign for reaffirming a national commitment to a democratic, pluralistic civil society. We have seen laws that attempt to limit teaching and learning\\u2014a departure from the principle of the classroom being a \\u201cmarketplace of ideas.\\u201d We have also seen the shortcomings of past curricula that left important stories untold. This brings us to a moment where we all have a collective choice: recommit to the project or backslide on affirming the promise of a more perfect union.The long awaited win in federal court provides hope for educators. That hope is most palpably felt in my home state of New Hampshire, but educators across the United States should take it to heart. It is the hard work of educators who choose to teach the truth and to speak up for what\\u2019s right that creates the foundation of civic life and the potential for civic renewal. But the promise of liberty and justice for all takes all of us working together\\u2014victory over \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d legislation is a chance to improve how we do democracy and support learning for each and every student. We cannot afford to waste this opportunity.Jacob Goodwin is a sixth grade social studies teacher and the 2021 New Hampshire History Teacher of the Year.Monthly Review does not necessarily adhere to all of the views conveyed in articles republished at MR Online.

Exhilarated Republicans made a display of this in Milwaukee, where the party formally chose Donald Trump as its presidential nominee. The attack on July 13th has also affected Democrats, who have been in turmoil since President Joe Biden\\u2019s catastrophic debate performance last month. It disrupted the effort within the party to replace Mr Biden as its nominee. After the shooting, the atmosphere of shock made it untenable for Democratic rebels in Congress to advance their attempt to challenge Mr Biden\\u2019s candidacy.

Robert Pattinson brought the World's Greatest Detective to and gave a performance that gave the old character a fresh perspective. Paul Dano's Riddler almost stole the show and as with most great comic book movies, it was really the villain that made the film. Yet, some of Batman's greatest villains have been mistreated in cinema and The Batman Part II is perfectly poised to fix a 27-year-old mistake that continues to haunt the Batman franchise.  In the much-maligned Batman & Robin, Arnold Schwarzenegger was given the chance to play Mr. Freeze alongside Poison Ivy and Bane. This version of Mr. Freeze was campy and nearly cartoony. This may have fit the vibe of Batman & Robin, but this version of the character has never sat well with Batman fans. Mr. Freeze is a complex character full of deep emotions and personal motivations, Batman & Robin felt like it skipped over all of that. The Batman Part II has been rumored to be looking at either Mr. Freeze or Clayface for its main villain and this would be the perfect chance to fix the errors of Batman & Robin, erasing the final memories of that film.  Why Fans Didn't Like Batman & Robin's Mr. Freeze         Related Batman: The Animated Series Cemented Mr. Freeze as a Sympathetic Villain  Thanks to Batman: The Animated Series giving him tragic character development, Mr. Freeze became one of Batman\\u2019s most sympathetic foes.       Schumacher Era Batman Films   IMDb Rating    Batman Forever   5.4    Batman & Robin   3.8      Batman and Batman Returns defined Batman for a generation. Tim Burton and Michael Keaton brought an unforgettable version of The Dark Knight to life that showcased the darker aspects of the character, rather than the campier aspects that had been so prevalent before. This is part of the reason that the Joel Schumacher films were so poorly received. Both Batman Forever and Batman & Robin abandoned the tone of the previous movies and went back and tried to embrace a more Adam West-style Batman, rather than this new darker version that audiences had embraced so quickly. This also went double for the villains that were in these movies. The Joker and the Penguin were creepy and memorable as villains, while villains like Riddler, Two-Face, Poison Ivy, and Mr. Freeze barely felt like a threat. Mr. Freeze especially had a hard time considering one of the greatest versions of the character had appeared on screen only a few years earlier.  Mr. Freeze in \\\"Heart of Ice,\\\" was a sympathetic yet threatening and dangerous villain who was more than capable of holding Gotham City in his grip of terror.  Batman: The Animated Series redefined a lot of expectations about Batman and his Rogue Gallery. Characters like Clayface, Harley Quinn, and the Ventriloquist all were given definitive interpretations, with this being Harley's first appearance also. Mr. Freeze is perhaps the biggest success story of Batman: The Animated Series. The storyline \\\"Heart of Ice,\\\" redefined the character of Mr. Freeze for the rest of the character's life. The version shown in Batman: The Animated Series was so popular that the comics made retcons to make the character on the page more similar to the character on screen. Mr. Freeze in \\\"Heart of Ice,\\\" was a sympathetic yet threatening and dangerous villain who was more than capable of holding Gotham City in his grip of terror. With this being such an iconic version, it made it impossible for Batman & Robin's version to be accepted. Even movies like Sub-Zero or other TV shows like Batman Beyond continued the reputation of Mr. Freeze more faithfully and intriguingly than Joel Schumacher's version. The Batman Part II can join a legacy of faithful adaptations, rather than silly ones.  The Batman Part II Can Revolutionize Mr. Freeze  Close           Related The Batman: Why Isn\\u2019t DC Studios Developing the Most Obvious Spin-Off?  The Penguin will be the first spin-off from Batman, and while others have been in the works, it's surprising this character hasn't been considered.2       Many fans credit Batman: The Animated Series for reimagining Mr. Freeze and making him a masterful modern villain.  Mr. Freeze's presence in The Batman Part II can create a darker and more realistic version than Schwarzenegger's portrayal. The Penguin could set up the accident that creates Mr. Freeze, therefore preparing him for his big screen appearance.   The Batman helped to change how people viewed many Batman characters including Carmine Falcone, the Penguin, and especially the Riddler. Each character was given a fresh feel in The Batman, with the Penguins being so strong that he was given his own HBO spinoff show. Now fans have high expectations for the villains in The Batman Part II, with many fans feeling extremely excited to see what Matt Reeves would do with characters like Clayface and Mr. Freeze. Reeves has a chance to revolutionize Mr. Freeze in the same way that Batman: The Animated Series and even the Arkham video games did. By truly diving into the intense psyche of Mr. Freeze in the same way he did for the Riddler, Victor Fries would become a leading villain of Batman's Rogue Gallery in a time when he has fallen into some obscurity.  Moving on past the campy and joke-filled Mr. Freeze that plagued the 90's movie would allow fans to move past that character and finally be given the on-screen adaptation of Mr. Freeze that is deserved. Freeze is an A-list character that has rarely been treated like that. Characters like Joker or Ra's Al Ghul have continued to dominate the spotlight, while Mr. Freeze can easily maintain just as strong a presence on-screen. Making Batman responsible for his transformation, or even reversing the roles and having Nora Fries become the villain while Victor is trapped, would be a great way to bring life back to the character in the film and treat the audience to something special, rather than another water-downed version of this intimidating foe. Mr. Freeze can terrorize all of Gotham City with his chilly demeanor and is capable of being truly terrifying. His misguided quest for love and power makes him immensely interesting and it is well past time to give Mr. Freeze a better live-action interpretation than Batman & Robin and Arnold Swchazanegger's failed attempt.

The sentencing took place on July 18 with Judge Ha Sang-je of the Suwon District Court's 12th Criminal Division presiding over the case.Mr. A, an expert in the OLED display field, worked at Samsung Display for over a decade before resigning to establish and operate his own display company in Korea. From 2018 to May 2020, Mr. A illegally acquired and used Samsung's trade secrets, including the \\\"OLED Display ELA (Excimer Laser Annealing) Equipment Inversion Optical System\\\" and \\\"OCR Inkjet Equipment\\\" technology, to sell and provide to Chinese companies.The ELA equipment inversion optical system is crucial for maintaining the intensity and stability of lasers used on OLED electronic circuits, while the OCR inkjet equipment is used to bond the OLED panel and the outermost cover glass of the screen. These technologies are valued at more than 340 billion won (around $251 million) and are integral to Samsung's competitive edge in the OLED market.Mr. A's scheme involved his juniors, subordinates, and friends from his time at Samsung, who helped siphon off trade secrets to his domestic company and replicate Samsung Display's technology. In August 2020, five accomplices were indicted. Among them, three former Samsung Display researchers were sentenced to one to two years in prison, while two friends received suspended sentences.In October 2020, Mr. A was indicted and detained on charges of violating the Unfair Competition Prevention Act (leaking trade secrets abroad). His detention period was set to expire in March of this year, and he was released on bail to be tried without detention. However, following the sentencing on July 18, Mr. A was immediately taken into custody.Samsung is a global leader in OLED technology, which is known for its superior image quality, including better contrast, faster response times, and more vibrant colors compared to traditional LCD displays. The company has invested heavily in research and development to maintain its competitive edge in the display market. The theft of such advanced technology can have significant repercussions, affecting the competitive landscape and leading to financial losses for Samsung.

Summary Daniel's world is rocked by the discovery of Mr. Miyagi's past secrets, leading to major conflicts in the next two parts of Cobra Kai season 6.  Showrunners Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg address the reveal of Miyagi's connection to the Sekai Taikai, teasing that the late sensei may not have actually fought in the tournament.  With the showrunners also having previously assured that the answers to the Miyagi mystery won't upend audiences' feelings of him, it seems likely this trunk of secrets will be something of a misdirect.  While the ending delivered a number of major shockers for its characters, Jon Hurwitz and Hayden Schlossberg have shared some insight for Cobra Kai season 6 part 1's tease of Mr. Miyagi's connection to the Sekai Taikai. As he and Johnny Lawrence prepare to train their Miyagi-Do and Eagle Fang students for the international tournament, Daniel LaRusso finds himself surprised at the discovery of a trunk hidden by Mr. Miyagi in his dojo. Among the secrets in the chest include a headband with the Sekai Taikai logo with dried blood on both ends of it, rocking Daniel to his core.  During an interview with Collider in anticipation of its premiere, Hurwitz and Schlossberg were asked about the reveal of Mr. Miyagi's connection to the Sekai Taikai in the Cobra Kai season 6 part 1 ending. The co-showrunners clarified that just because Daniel's late sensei has the headband, it doesn't necessarily mean that he fought in the tournament, while also teasing that the reveal will have a major impact on Daniel going into the tournament itself. See what Hurwitz and Schlossberg explained below:  HURWITZ: It means that his relationship to tournaments is maybe a little bit different than what Daniel thought it was and what we were led to believe in the past. First of all, we don't know if he fought in the Sekai Taikai. We just know that he has a headband from the Sekai Taikai. We don't know what exactly happened there to this point. You\\u2019ll have to watch further to find out more about that. But I think there's a lot of intrigue as Daniel enters the middle five episodes, and he's at the Sekai Taikai. He certainly wants to know more about what went on there and if anyone maybe knows anything about the history.  SCHLOSSBERG: If you look at the original movie, Mr. Miyagi makes it pretty clear that he hasn't been in tournaments before to Daniel, so you can interpret that as a conflict that Daniel is gonna have to deal with. Why would he not say anything about this and act as if that's not a part of his past, if it is? Again, like Jon said, it's a headband that could be anybody's. Daniel assumes he fought in the Sekai Taikai.  What Mr. Miyagi's Headband Means For Cobra Kai Season 6 Part 2  Daniel's head won't be in the game for his dojo.  Close      Throughout both the original Karate Kid movies and Cobra Kai, Mr. Miyagi's lessons left quite an indelible mark on Daniel in his most formative years. Even as the teenage LaRusso was faced with everything from high school bullies to murderous antagonists, he frequently stayed true to the lessons taught by his mentor, namely those of mercy and forgiveness. As such, the reveal of Mr. Miyagi's more troublesome past is about to cause major problems for Daniel going into Cobra Kai season 6's Sekai Taikai.    In addition to the Sekai Taikai headband, the chest seen in Cobra Kai season 6 part 1's ending also contained a newspaper clipping of an assault and robbery in 1947, which Miyagi was suspected of committing. Given the peaceful nature Daniel was accustomed to of his late sensei, his desire to find answers seems likely to take priority over the training and coaching of his students, which will likely put a further strain on his and Johnny's crumbling partnership. Schlossberg and Ralph Macchio previously teased this kind of arc to Screen Rant, with the former pointing towards it being a means to \\\"understand the past\\\", as seen below:  The big conflict that Daniel has this season is realizing that his mentor, who he thought was the most perfect, ideal person of all time, actually had flaws. And I think, for us, we were okay with that, because we always assumed that Mr. Miyagi was a human being, and that he wasn't necessarily born a sage, he wasn't born as somebody who had all the answers. This season, you're gonna get a little taste of that, and the hope is that it's not something that upends what you think about Miyagi, but instead kind of paints a deeper picture of him. But for the here and now, it rocks Daniel to his core, and it's something that's throwing a wrench into his mojo at a time when the students need him at his best.  With Schlossberg and Hurwitz seemingly hinting that the Sekai Taikai headband in Miyagi's trunk could be a misdirect, it also seems possible that Cobra Kai season 6 part 2 will reveal that the late character was actually framed for some of these past events. The greater inclusion of Master Kim Sun-Yung could also very well be building towards this reveal, and explain why he would be open to working with Kreese to build a new team to bring down Miyagi-Do at the international tournament.  Cobra Kai season part 2 will premiere on Netflix on November 15.

In simple terms, it is a speech that lays out the government\\u2019s legislative program for the coming year.The speech is written by the elected government, currently led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, and delivered by the king during a joint session of the House of Lords and the House of Commons.The event is a symbol of the monarch\\u2019s constitutional role as head of state and is accompanied by centuries of tradition. It is the only routine occasion during which both houses of Parliament and the Crown come together in the same place.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adWhy now? This year\\u2019s State Opening of Parliament marks the first sitting of the House of Commons following the July 4 general election in which Starmer\\u2019s left-leaning Labour Party won an overwhelming victory, ending 14 years of Conservative Party rule.It gives Starmer the opportunity to spell out his government\\u2019s priorities and the legislation it intends to pass in the coming year.But there is more to it than just a speech, right? Of course. Britain and the royals know how to put on a show.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adThe King\\u2019s Speech dates back to at least the 15th century, and the traditions highlight that history.The event gets underway at 9:30 am, when the Yeomen of the Guard \\u2014 a group of ceremonial bodyguards who still wear traditional red and gold uniforms from the Tudor period \\u2014 search the cellars beneath the Houses of Parliament for explosives. The tradition is a reminder of the 1605 Gunpowder Plot in which Roman Catholic rebels led by Guy Fawkes tried to kill Protestant King James I by blowing up the building during the State Opening of Parliament.The public show starts later in the morning, when the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment leads a procession from Buckingham Palace to the Houses of Parliament. The monarch travels in a gilded coach, while a separate coach carries the Imperial State Crown, the Cap of Maintenance and Sword of State.Meanwhile, a lawmaker goes to the palace as a symbolic hostage to ensure the king\\u2019s safe return. The tradition dates back to King Charles I\\u2019s effort to arrest lawmakers in 1642 as he tried to assert his right to govern without the advice and consent of Parliament. Charles I was ultimately tried for treason and beheaded.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adEver since then, the monarch has been barred from entering the House of Commons. That is why the opening ceremony takes place in the House of Lords, Parliament\\u2019s unelected upper chamber.The Lords will send a security official called the Black Rod to the Commons to summon members to the joint sitting. But lawmakers traditionally slam the door in Black Rod\\u2019s face to symbolize their independence. Only after Black Rod pounds on the door with a staff will lawmakers make their way to the House of Lords, purposefully taking their time to once again show that the elected house holds the real power. Upon arrival, they pile into the back of a chamber packed with lords in ermine-trimmed scarlet robes.\\u201cIt\\u2019s a terrible cram because there are so many people and not enough space,\\u201d said George Gross, a royal historian at King\\u2019s College London. \\u201cBut I think that\\u2019s part of the magic of the occasion, this sense that you\\u2019ve got everything crammed together \\u2026 a very unusual moment that otherwise doesn\\u2019t happen.\\u2033The king traditionally delivers his speech from a golden throne while wearing the Robe of State and the diamond-encrusted Imperial State Crown.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adHas Charles done this before? This will be third speech Charles has delivered, and his second as king.In 2022, the late Queen Elizabeth II delegated this critical duty to Charles. The move was seen as evidence that a transition was underway, with the 96-year-old monarch remaining on the throne but turning over more responsibilities to her eldest son.The choreography of the day emphasized a queen who was absent and yet still present. Her throne had been removed, but in its place the Imperial State Crown sat propped on a pillow. Charles, wearing the uniform of an admiral of the fleet, glittered in gold braid rather than sweeping ermine robes.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adAfter becoming king, Charles presided over his own ermine-infused affair last year.What are they thinking? Charles is the head of state, but he is constitutionally obliged to follow the government\\u2019s advice. As such, he will likely be inscrutable in his reading of the speech, offering no clue as to whether he approves of the policies he announces on behalf of \\u201cmy government.\\u201dLikewise, members of both houses of Parliament are expected to listen to the speech in silence \\u2014 unusual indeed for the House of Commons, where political debate is often raucous and irreverent.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adSo what does it all mean? All the pomp and circumstance is there to make a point, Gross told The Associated Press. Those ceremonial events highlight the turning points in British history.What really matters is the reference to Charles I, which cements the road to Britain becoming a constitutional monarchy, showcasing that neither the monarch nor anyone else can march into Parliament and demand whatever they want, Gross said.\\u2019\\u2019It ultimately shows where power lies, and power now lies via the people through the government,\\u2033 Gross said.AdvertisementArticle continues below this adBeyond that, there\\u2019s something for every branch of British government. The \\u201cgenius\\u2019\\u2019 of the ceremony is its ability to have something for everyone \\u2014 the lords, the lawmakers and the crown, said anthropologist Emma Crewe of SOAS University of London, who has studied Parliament.\\u201cI do think that stories are really, really powerful and we do well to listen to the stories that people tell about our most important political institution,'' she told the AP. \\\"It reminds us that it\\u2019s been around for a very long time, and we should protect it. And we should get involved.''July 16, 2024|Updated July 17, 2024 6:00 a.m.DANICA KIRKAMost Popular1.Pedestrian killed by pickup making evasive maneuver2.Midland's The Palms offers rare Kobe beef and wagyu3.New Sewell automotive campus in Midland to open in 20264.Memphis animal services director on leave after dog death5.2024 MRT Postseason Baseball All-Star TeamMore from MRTOil & EnergyWTI crashes near $80Crude prices fell for a second consecutive week in largely listless tradingOil & EnergyMidland County unchanged with 18 rigsDrilling activity remains bound in a tight range, hovering near three-year lowsNewsMidland's civilian labor force nears 117,000Summer doldrums continued to increase Midland's unemployment rate, which rose to 2.9% in...NewsWant to run for local office?

Vance of Ohio became the latest, and potentially most consequential, of Donald J. Trump\\u2019s apprentices to accept the position in prime time.For years as the host of \\u201cThe Apprentice,\\u201d Mr. Trump picked out prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9s from boardrooms full of young supplicants. There was a delicate art to getting the nod. Offend him and you might be dismissed; appear too thirsty and you could get the boot as well. The key was to be yourself but also be him, to be a mirror but a flattering one, to be an echo auto-tuned to please the boss\\u2019s ear.Mr. Vance spent much of his two years in the Senate auditioning for the promotion to vice-presidential nominee, cultivating a relationship, apologizing for his Never-Trumper apostasy and recently blaming Biden campaign rhetoric for leading \\u201cdirectly\\u201d to the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump.Accepting the nomination on Wednesday night, he cast himself as a loyal fighter, an ideological heir and a grateful son of the working class with roots in Appalachia and the Rust Belt.With Merle Haggard\\u2019s \\u201cAmerica First\\u201d as his walk-on music, he began his speech praising Mr. Trump: \\u201cHe didn\\u2019t need politics,\\u201d Mr. Vance said, \\u201cbut the country needed him.\\u201d Mr. Trump looked on smiling in split-screen, as if watching a winner at a season finale.When it came to introducing himself, Mr. Vance had a head start and a challenge. He was telling a story he had already told, in the memoir \\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\\u201d and so had Ron Howard, in the 2020 film adaptation.We are having trouble retrieving the article content.Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

That\\u2019s probably because these men and women weren\\u2019t just kissing the ring: They were performing things on it one shouldn\\u2019t do in polite company. If God was present at the convention, which is something to which speakers repeatedly referred, surely he would not be pleased to see such lustful acts committed in public and outside of marriage.Over and over, speaker after speaker, the message was the same: America needs Donald Trump again. The economy was better when Mr. Trump was in charge, they said (which is a complicated claim; inflation was certainly lower, but Mr. Trump ran huge deficits, which have continued under President Joe Biden). There was less violent crime when Mr. Trump was running the country (not true). America\\u2019s borders were more secure, and there were fewer illegal immigrants (true).There was less global instability, more domestic pride and prosperity, and greater affordability, they said. The sun shone brighter. Bathwater never ran cold. Ice cream was somehow sweeter. God spared Mr. Trump from a would-be assassin last weekend, said South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, Donald Trump Jr., Arkansas Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and others, because his work for the would-be president is not finished. Mr. Trump must save America.A certain level of adulation for the leader is of course expected during the nomination exercise. It has been a feature of Republican conventions of the past, and no doubt will centre in the coming Democratic event in early August as well. But what made this particular exercise in fealty so striking, even compared with previous Trump nominations, was the degree of self-flagellation on display by Mr. Trump\\u2019s former critics. One by one, they took to the stage to bow before the king, lining up dutifully as his loyal servants.It was a humiliating exercise. Ex-Trump rival Nikki Haley endured boos as she offered her \\u201cstrong endorsement\\u201d of Mr. Trump, saying she accepted his invitation to speak in the name of \\u201cunity.\\u201dDuring her bid for the Republican nomination, Ms. Haley called the former president \\u201cunhinged\\u201d and said he couldn\\u2019t win a general election. She also questioned his mental acuity, and said that his continued leadership would be like \\u201csuicide for the country.\\u201dThose comments weren\\u2019t reflective of typical sparring during a nomination contest. Indeed, Ms. Haley wasn\\u2019t simply saying that Mr. Trump would be bad for America; she was saying that he would destroy the country. And seemingly tied to that conviction, she resisted offering her endorsement even after she dropped out of the race.But the winds changed, and Mr. Trump has now reoccupied his throne atop the Republican Party mount. On Tuesday night, Ms. Haley \\u2013 whom Mr. Trump labelled \\u201cbirdbrain\\u201d during the nomination race \\u2013 extolled the nominee as \\u201ctough,\\u201d clear-headed and open-minded. She said she was \\u201cproud\\u201d to serve in his previous cabinet. She professed her loyalty, and retreated back to her place among the masses.Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who also made a bid for the presidential nomination, did the same. He had previously derided Mr. Trump as an ineffective president, chastising him for failing to complete his border wall and implying he is too old and too self-centred to run the country again. But at the convention, Mr. DeSantis (dubbed \\u201cDeSanctimonious\\u201d during the race by Mr. Trump) decried that the former president has been \\u201cdemonized\\u201d by those around him, and implored viewers and attendees to offer him their unwavering support. \\u201cWe cannot let him down,\\u201d he said.Florida Senator Marco Rubio said during Mr. Trump\\u2019s first run at the nomination that he was a \\u201ccon man\\u201d who couldn\\u2019t be trusted with nuclear secrets. Mr. Rubio was passed over as Mr. Trump\\u2019s vice-presidential pick this time around, though he nevertheless celebrated Mr. Trump at the convention for inspiring a movement. And J.D. Vance, who is Mr. Trump\\u2019s pick for vice-president, and who previously compared the would-be president to Adolf Hitler, said his running mate is America\\u2019s \\u201clast, best hope.\\u201d He celebrated him as a fundamentally good person, saying that though he is tough, \\u201che cares about people.\\u201dTo the extent that there was ever a healthy reckoning within the Republican Party after the first Trump presidency \\u2013 and especially after the party\\u2019s significant 2022 midterm losses \\u2013 that period for reflection is clearly over. The resistance is dead. The Republican Party is the party of Mr. Trump yet again, and those who fail to fall in line will falter before his awesome power. All signs point to a second-term president who will be even more insulated by the shamelessly obsequious, and thus even more emboldened to take radical, fanatic actions. Yes, Mr. Trump is calling for unity, but this unity must all be in service to one man.

Not only that, each of the 50 YouTubers received a retro gaming handheld to call their own.The discovery was made on r/SBCGaming, where a screenshot of LilyPichu\\u2019s vlog of her experience being in the MrBeast competition surfaced. Each participant was given a goody bag, which features custom AirPods, and something a little more unusual: An Anbernic RG353V handheld.Article continues after adArticle continues after adThe Anbernic RG353V isn\\u2019t one of the priciest retro handhelds out there. In fact, the device with its 3.4-inch IPS display, and up to 2GB LPDDDR4 of RAM (depending on the version) has an MRSP of $120.99. Even with all 50 YouTubers each receiving their own, that\\u2019s still just over $6000 USD of handhelds alone.While the Anbernic RG353V is not the most expensive, or even the most high-powered retro handheld out there, MrBeast\\u2019s choice to give it away makes sense. The YouTuber has cited his love of the Nintendo Game Boy repeatedly in the past, even going so far as to commission a custom Game Boy from The Retro Future years ago.Related:MrBeast reveals insane ad revenue earned from Twitter/X videoArticle continues after adAlthough the RG353V is not an official Nintendo handheld, it takes after the Game Boy in multiple ways. Its form factor is highly reminiscent of that of the DMG model Game Boy but with some added extras. Article continues after adInstead of just a D-pad and two-button layout, the RG353V features a left stick, a full ABXY button layout, and built-in WiFi. Depending on the version MrBeast gave away, the retro handheld also has a touch-screen to use alongside Android-based games, a microSD card slot, and a 3200mAH rechargeable battery. Maybe some of these creators will fall in love with the emerging retro handheld emulator scene.Article continues after adkeep readingYouTubeMrBeast breaks his own record for day-one viewership with latest videoDaniel ApplefordYouTubeEvery creator in MrBeast\\u2019s $1 million YouTuber challenge & how they got eliminatedCarver FisherYouTubeMrBeast reveals video idea he wasn\\u2019t allowed to makeAlice Sj\\u00f6bergEntertainmentHow to apply for MrBeast\\u2019s $5 million Beast Games competitionMeera JackaYouTubeMrBeast urges billionaires to put their \\u201cunfathomable wealth\\u201d into YouTube contentMichael GwilliamYouTubeMrBeast reveals how much money he\\u2019s made reposting old YouTube videos to XMeera JackaYouTubeMrBeast\\u2019s Beast Games: Prize, where to watch & moreShay RobsonEntertainmentCreators furious as MrBeast nets $250K on Twitter/X for posting old videoVirginia GlazeRelated TopicsHandheldslilypichuMrbeastAbout The AuthorRosalie NewcombeDexerto's Senior Tech Writer.

This iconic weapon is said to have been used by the Maratha king to kill Afzal Khan, the general in the Bijapur Adil Shahi empireread moreAdvertisementThe iconic weapon will be displayed across various museums in Maharashtra for three years. Image courtesy: Victoria and Albert MuseumThe iconic \\u2018wagh nakh\\u2019 (tiger claw-shaped dagger) that is said to be used by the Maratha empire\\u2019s warrior king, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj has been repatriated from the London to its homeland in Maharashtra.The wagh nakh was taken to Chhatrapati Shivaji Sangrahalay (museum) in western Maharashtra\\u2019s Satara, where it will be put on display from July 19, the state\\u2019s Culture Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar told PTI.The weapon has been brought back by Indian authorities from London\\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum \\u201con loan\\u201d for three years during which it will be put on display across several museums in Maharashtra.AdvertisementOn Friday, the weapon will reach Satara which is preparing to accord a grand welcome, State Excise Minister Shambhuraj Desai said earlier this week, adding that it will be encased in a bulletproof cover. Moreover, he said that security has also been beefed up at the museum where wagh nakh will be on display for seven months.The special exhibit, featuring many other artifacts from the Maratha king, will be inaugurated by CM Eknath Shinde and DCMs Ajit Pawar and Devendra Fadnavis on Friday (July 19).But what makes this weapon so significant and how did it end up in London\\u2019s Victoria and Albert Museum? Let\\u2019s take a closer lookThe historyAfzal Khan, a general who served the Adil Shah dynasty of Bijapur, was ordered to conduct a military operation against Chhatrapati Shivaji\\u2019s Maratha empire. According to the London-based museum, the duo arranged a truce and agreed to meet \\u2013 alone and unarmed \\u2013 in a tented enclosure during a protracted military engagement in 1659.The catch, however, was that both carried concealed weapons. Shivaji wore chainmail under his clothes and a metal skull protection under his turban, while hiding a metallic \\u2019tiger claw\\u2019 in his hand. When they fought, the Maratha warrior \\u201cdisembowelled his opponent,\\u201d the museum\\u2019s website said.\\u201cThis weapon was quite dangerous and was used to surprise the opponent. It was used in close combat without letting the opponent know,\\\" medieval weapons expert Indrajeet Sawant told The Print.AdvertisementThe weapon which was handed by the last Peshwa (Prime Minister) of the Marathas, Baji Rao II, surrendered to the British in June 1818 after defeat in the Third Anglo-Maratha War and was banished to Bithoor near Kanpur.The museum\\u2019s website further said it is possible one of Peshwas\\u2019 officials \\u201cgifted\\u201d this weapon to James Grant Duff, East India Company official and Resident or political agent of the Satara state in 1818, who later gave it to the British museum.Maharashtra government and London\\u2019s Victoria and Albert (V&A) Museum signed the MoU for the repatriation of wagh nakh in October 2023. PTIHowever, it has not been possible to verify whether these tiger claws are the ones used by Shivaji nearly 160 years earlier, the museum stated.AdvertisementWhy is wagh nakh\\u2019s authenticity in question?After news broke, Sawant claimed that the iconic weapon that was being brought back to India was not \\u201coriginal\\u201d and asserted the one used by the legendary emperor remains in the state\\u2019s Satara itself.According to historians, the wagh nakh was kept in the sanctum sanctorum of a temple housed within the ruler\\u2019s family residence.Another researcher, Pandurang Balkawade, told a Marathi TV channel that Pratapsinh Chhatrapati, the last emperor of the Maratha empire, gave the weapon from his personal collection to Duff between 1818 and 1823, adding that his great-great-grandson then handed it over to the museum.AdvertisementAccording to the museum\\u2019s website, the weapon was accompanied by a fitted case made after Grant Duff returned to Scotland. The inscription on the case reads, \\u201cThe \\u2018Wagnuck\\u2019 of Sivajee With Which He Killed the Moghul General. This Relic was given to Mr. James Grant-Duff of Eden When he was Resident at Satara Minister of the Peshwa of the Marathas\\u201d.The inscription on the case reads, \\u2018The \\u2018Wagnuck\\u2019 of Sivajee With Which He Killed the Moghul General.

Agreeing with him, Sawant, said there are multiple such tiger claws, and their references have come up many times.AdvertisementHowever, the Maharashtra government rejected such claims.\\u201cIt is unfortunate that doubts are being raised about Shivaji\\u2019s wagh nakh,\\u201d Cultural Affairs Minister Mungantiwar told PTI and noted that the item being procured from London was the original one which had been displayed in two exhibitions in London held in 1875 and 1896 respectively.The iconic tiger claw weapon is set to be displayed in three other museums apart from the one in Satara, namely the Central Museum in Nagpur, the Lakshmi Vilas Palace in Kolhapur and CSMVS in Mumbai, a Government Resolution (GR) stated.With input from agenciesTagsIndiaUnited KingdomRead MoreFind us on YouTubeSubscribeTop ShowsRelated StoriesRice stocks surging to record, India to ease export curbs it imposed in 2023: Report'Elder statesman at 44': Rishi Sunak nails first speech as UK Opposition LeaderLucky Indians whose salary as well as income tax is paid by governmentUnion Budget: A perfect platform to unlock India's space potentialRice stocks surging to record, India to ease export curbs it imposed in 2023: Report'Elder statesman at 44': Rishi Sunak nails first speech as UK Opposition LeaderLucky Indians whose salary as well as income tax is paid by governmentUnion Budget: A perfect platform to unlock India's space potentialAbout FirstpostMost Searched CategoriesWeb StoriesWorldIndiaExplainersOpinionSportsCricketTech/AutoEntertainmentIPL 2024NETWORK18 SITESNews18Money ControlCNBC TV18Forbes IndiaSitemapis on YouTubeSubscribe NowCopyright @ 2024.

In previous years various amounts up to \\u00a3100,000 were received as a grant. However this year, due to budgetary restrictions, the annual grant has been limited to \\u00a340,000 and sadly costs have not gone down and in fact have increased substantially,\\u201d Mr Higgins said.A Lancaster flying high at the Jersey International Air Display in 2023 Picture: DAVID FERGUSON. (38594549)A crowdfunding page has been launched and Mr Higgins said that if each person who watched the display were to donate \\u00a35, it would not only fund this year\\u2019s display but also put the event on a more sustainable footing for the future.\\u201cThe Jersey International Air Display is part of the DNA of our Island community. Not only is it a significant event in the Island\\u2019s calendar for locals and visitors alike but, with its origins in the previous Battle of Britain Air Display, it also remains a poignant reminder of the reasons behind our Liberation, and our liberty. It also remains a significant day for relevant charities to raise funds to care for our military veterans,\\u201d Mr Higgins said.Watched in person and online by more than 50,000 people \\u2013 the organisers say \\u2013 the display is funded from a combination of private and government sources. Mr Higgins explained that, having had to reduce its scale as a result of restrictions following the Covid pandemic, they now aspired to return the event to its previous stature with enhanced static displays and educational areas.Jersey International Air Display organiser Mike Higgins at the 2023 display Picture: James Jeune (38598762)Aircraft booked for the 2024 display include the \\u00c9quipe de Voltige de l\\u2019Arm\\u00e9e de l\\u2019Air (French Air Force Extra 330), the RAF Falcons parachute display team, the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Lancaster, the French North American OV-10 Bronco, French Conair Turbo Firecat (ex-S\\u00e9curit\\u00e9 Civile fire fighting aircraft), Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat and the Dutch Fokker D.XXI WW II fighter.Mr Higgins said that, in the event that the 2024 display did not take place, all funds raised would be put towards next year\\u2019s event, or split between Jersey\\u2019s Helping Wings charity and British Military Service charities if the decision were taken not to proceed permanently.Those wishing to support the event can do so using the link: sportsgiving.co.uk/sponsor/activity/appeal-for-12-september-2024/jersey-international-air-display.

File| Photo Credit: PTIAll India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday lambasted the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government after a police order reportedly instructed owners of eateries along the Kanwar Yatra to display names of staff. He said this order was akin to reviving untouchability.Speaking to the media at party headquarters in Darussalaam, the Hyderabad parliamentarian said the oral order was in violation of the articles in the Constitution that deal with the right to live, the right to a livelihood and abolishing of untouchability. \\u201cWe have removed untouchability under Article 17, and you are bringing it back. It is a clear-cut discriminatory order. It shows that they want to make Muslims second-class citizens in UP, and in the country,\\u201d he said, adding that since the Uttar Pradesh government gave the order, Muslims working in the dhabas of Muzaffarnagar have been fired.Contesting the Uttar Pradesh government stand, Mr. Owaisi said: \\u201cI challenge you to issue a written order. The Yogi Adityanath government should release a written order and show it to us. There is clear discrimination that is happening against Muslims. The Constitution is being smashed to smithereens.\\u201dThe AIMIM chief said the order gives the impression that Adolf Hitler\\u2019s spirit have entered Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath\\u2019s body. \\u201cThis is like the krystallnacht moment. Hitler did a Judenboykott. This kind of a boycott is being done by the Uttar Pradesh government. Who are you to do this? Will you give a yatra so much importance at the cost of ruining the livelihoods of others? Will you work for just one community? Where will the Constitution go? In the dustbin?\\u201d Mr. Owaisi said.He ascribed the move to the pressure exerted by Hindutva organisations, and claimed that the move has radicalised sections of the Hindu community. \\u201cWhy is there so much hate in the BJP for the Muslims?\\u201d he sought to know.Read Comments Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditREAD LATERRemoveSEE ALLPRINTRelated TopicsTelangana/All India Majlis-E-Ittehadul MuslimeenTop News Today0 / 0Read in AppThe HinduAbout UsCode of Editorial ValuesNews ArchiveSitemapPrint SubscriptionDigital SubscriptionSubscribe to NewslettersRss FeedsReaders Editor-Terms of ReferenceAuthors & ContributorsContact usContact UsSocial MediaAdvertise With UsGroup News SitesBusiness LineBL on CampusSportstarFrontline\\u0b87\\u0ba8\\u0bcd\\u0ba4\\u0bc1 \\u0ba4\\u0bae\\u0bbf\\u0bb4\\u0bcd \\u0ba4\\u0bbf\\u0b9a\\u0bc8The Hindu CentreYoung World ClubThe Hindu ePaperBusiness Line ePaperCrossword + Free GamesOther ProductsRoofandFloorSTEPImagesClassifieds - PrintBookstore & Special PublicationsPopular SectionsElectionsIsraeli\\u2013Palestinian conflict 2023Latest NewsNational NewsInternational NewsVideosLife & StyleFoodPodcastShowcaseOpinionEditorialColumnsCommentCartoonLettersInterviewLeadBusinessAgri-BusinessIndustryEconomyMarketsBudgetSportCricketFootballHockeyTennisAthleticsMotorsportRacesOther SportsSci-TechScienceTechnologyHealthAgricultureEnvironmentGadgetsInternetStatesAndhra PradeshKarnatakaKeralaTamil NaduTelanganaCitiesBengaluruChennaiCoimbatoreDelhiHyderabadKochiKolkataKozhikodeMaduraiMangaluruMumbaiPuducherryThiruvananthapuramTiruchirapalliVijayawadaVisakhapatnamTrending on The HinduNewsIndia NewsLive News from the HinduNEET-UG 2024 hearing LIVEAanvi Kamdar News: Travel influencer dies after falling into gorgeTDS Fraud CaseSC directs NTA to publish results by July 20 noonIndia vs Sri Lanka Squad: Suryakumar Yadav to lead India in T20IsLast universal common ancestor (LUCA)ED raids premises of Haryana Congress MLA, others in \\u20b91,400 crore bank fraud caseTrending on Group sitesStock Market Live UpdatesStocks to buy todayLok Sabha Election Results 2024Spain vs England LIVEGold Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayCSK vs SRH LIVEFootball NewsPolitics NewsFrontline Current IssueTerms of UsePrivacy Policy Copyright\\u00a9 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

A view of the political banner on ECR Road at Lawspet.| Photo Credit: S.S. KUMARResidents have welcomed the district administration\\u2019s decision to launch a dedicated helpline for people to lodge complaints on illegal hoardings, banners and cut-outs in Puducherry.Sub-Divisional Magistrate, North, Arjun Ramakrishnan, had a few days ago, announced the launch of Whatsapp number 9443383418 for people to report on display of illegal publicity materials in public places. Mr. Ramakrishnan, in a release, had requested vigilant citizens to post the photos of illegally displayed publicity structures. The photos should have date, time and location stamp, he said.Welcoming the decision of the district administration to launch a grievance mechanism pertaining to construction of hoardings, President of PeoplesPulse P. Devanathan said it was one of the long pending demands of residents\\u2019 associations and non-governmental groups in dealing with hoardings.\\u201cIn fact, we had written to the administration to introduce a Whatsapp number for residents to complain about banner culture. We hope the move would help residents to immediately bring to the notice of administration the difficulty faced by illegal banners in a particular area,\\u201d he said.Bhoominathan, a resident of Karuvadikuppam, said that though there had been some improvement in the implementation of the ban on putting up hoardings, politicians continue to erect sizeable cut-outs during birthday celebrations and during political meetings.\\u201cWe have seen several proactive steps from the District Administration in removing illegal banners during the last few months but still the rules are violated by a section of politicians. The ECR, near Sivaji Statue was full of banners and hoardings coinciding the birthday of a politician a few days ago. The culture can be defeated only when people completely cooperate with the government,\\u201d Mr. Boominathan said. He added that banners were displayed on Bussy Street to mark the birthday of a prominent actor on Thursday.Hamper vehicle movementOfficials in the Public Works Department said they are facing stiff resistance in removing hoardings and cut-outs from public places. \\u201cTwo weeks ago, our workers were prevented from removing the structures at Thavalakuppam. We faced a similar situation at Murungapakkam a few days ago. People are not understanding that putting up of such display materials hamper vehicle and pedestrian movement. It is also a threat to public life,\\u201d said a PWD official. Mr. Ramakrishnan told The Hindu that the administration would take severe action against those violating the ban order. Around 20 cases were registered under section 6 of the Pondicherry Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement Act, 2000) for construction of hoardings and cut-outs in public places, he said. \\u201cWe have come across reports of obstruction caused by people to government servants while removing such illegal materials. It is an offence under section 221 of the Bharathiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, punishable with imprisonment or fine or both. We seek cooperation of people to keep Puducherry free from illegal banners and to prevent any threat to the safety and lives of the innocent public from banners and cut-outs,\\u201d he said.Read Comments Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditREAD LATERRemoveSEE ALLPRINTTop News Today0 / 0Read in AppThe HinduAbout UsCode of Editorial ValuesNews ArchiveSitemapPrint SubscriptionDigital SubscriptionSubscribe to NewslettersRss FeedsReaders Editor-Terms of ReferenceAuthors & ContributorsContact usContact UsSocial MediaAdvertise With UsGroup News SitesBusiness LineBL on CampusSportstarFrontline\\u0b87\\u0ba8\\u0bcd\\u0ba4\\u0bc1 \\u0ba4\\u0bae\\u0bbf\\u0bb4\\u0bcd \\u0ba4\\u0bbf\\u0b9a\\u0bc8The Hindu CentreYoung World ClubThe Hindu ePaperBusiness Line ePaperCrossword + Free GamesOther ProductsRoofandFloorSTEPImagesClassifieds - PrintBookstore & Special PublicationsPopular SectionsElectionsIsraeli\\u2013Palestinian conflict 2023Latest NewsNational NewsInternational NewsVideosLife & StyleFoodPodcastShowcaseOpinionEditorialColumnsCommentCartoonLettersInterviewLeadBusinessAgri-BusinessIndustryEconomyMarketsBudgetSportCricketFootballHockeyTennisAthleticsMotorsportRacesOther SportsSci-TechScienceTechnologyHealthAgricultureEnvironmentGadgetsInternetStatesAndhra PradeshKarnatakaKeralaTamil NaduTelanganaCitiesBengaluruChennaiCoimbatoreDelhiHyderabadKochiKolkataKozhikodeMaduraiMangaluruMumbaiPuducherryThiruvananthapuramTiruchirapalliVijayawadaVisakhapatnamTrending on The HinduNewsIndia NewsLive News from the HinduNEET-UG 2024 hearing LIVEAanvi Kamdar News: Travel influencer dies after falling into gorgeTDS Fraud CaseSC directs NTA to publish results by July 20 noonParody account\\u2019s post lands YouTuber Dhruv Rathee in legal troubleNEET-UG 2024 CounsellingIAS officers reshuffle in TNTrending on Group sitesStock Market Live UpdatesStocks to buy todayLok Sabha Election Results 2024Spain vs England LIVEGold Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayCSK vs SRH LIVEFootball NewsPolitics NewsFrontline Current IssueTerms of UsePrivacy Policy Copyright\\u00a9 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

File| Photo Credit: ANIUnion Minister Jitan Ram Manjhi on July 20 asserted that he saw \\\"nothing wrong\\\" with fruit sellers along the 'Kanwar Yatra' route in Uttar Pradesh being asked to display their names at their stalls.Mr. Manjhi was responding to journalists' questions about the controversial U.P. police directive, which has faced criticism from the Opposition and some BJP allies, including Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar's [Janatha Dal (United) [JD(U)] and Union Minister Chirag Paswan's Lok Janshakti Party (Ram Vilas).Mr. Manjhi, who heads the Hindustani Awam Morcha, asked, \\\"I cannot speak for other parties, but I see nothing wrong with such an order. What is the harm if people involved in businesses are asked to display their names and addresses prominently? In fact, such a display only makes it easy for buyers to spot a favourite stall. It is wrong to view the episode through the prism of religion\\\", Mr. Manjhi added, who made his Parliamentary debut, at the age of 79, in the recent elections.Mr. Manjhi's stance on the issue differs from that of Mr. Paswan, another Dalit leader from Bihar. Mr. Paswan recently told PTI that he disapproved of the directive, stating that \\\"casteism and communalism have harmed the country more than anything else.\\\" The Opposition has alleged that the U.P. police directive aims to push Muslim fruit sellers out of business during the pilgrimage season.JD(U) chief spokesman K. .C Tyagi criticised the U.P. police order, invoking Prime Minister Narendra Modi's sabka saath sabka vikas slogan and noting that similar directives have not been issued in other States associated with Kanwar Yatra, such as Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan.Interestingly, Mr. Manjhi has often drawn flak from the BJP for remarks like \\\"Lord Rama is imaginary, not historical\\\" and tirade against Brahmins.
