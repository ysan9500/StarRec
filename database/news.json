Relatively poor red LED  performance is a roadblock on the route to full-color displays based on InGaN  LED technology. Apart from much lower cost, the advantage of using silicon  substrates include better thermal conductivity than the more usual  sapphire-based epitaxy.\\nThe epitaxial structure for the red  micro-LED arrays was grown by metal-organic chemical vapor  deposition (MOCVD) on 4-inch Si (111)  wafers (Figure 1). The buffer region was  1.3\\u03bcm, followed by 2\\u03bcm n-GaN contact. The  superlattice consisted of 10 pairs of  0.9/5nm Al0.04Ga0.96N/In0.05Ga0.95N. \\n\\n Figure 1: (a) InGaN/GaN red micro-LED  epitaxial structure. (b) Transmission electron microscope (TEM) image. (c)  Fabrication process flow and photograph inset of InGaN/GaN red micro-LEDs on  4-inch silicon wafer.\\nThe active light-generating region  consisted of a three-well multiple quantum well  (MQW). The wells were 2.4nm In0.23Al0.05Ga0.72N separated by 10nm  GaN barriers. The MQW was capped with 12nm AlGaN varying in Al-content in three  steps (13%, 7%, 42%). The structure was completed with 150nm p-GaN as the  contact layer.\\nThe researchers used the material to  fabricate the red micro-LED arrays. The first step was deposition of 200nm  annealed indium tin oxide (ITO) as a transparent ohmic conductor  p-electrode. The mesa structures for the individual LEDs were fabricated through  a three-step inductively coupled plasma-reactive ion etching  process. The steps consisted of ITO etching, hydrochloric acid treatment to remove ITO residues, and the  final etching down to the n-GaN layer.\\nThe metal contacts with the common  n-electrode and ITO p-contact consisted of chromium/gold (Cr/Au), deposited  after 500nm silicon nitride (SiNx) CVD passivation. A passive matrix  (PM) array format was used to wire the LEDs together in pixels.\\nThe researchers point out that all these  processes were carried out at the 4-inch wafer scale. The team comments: \\u201cIn  semiconductor fabrication, the most effective way to lower costs is through  large-scale wafer-level fabrication, as it allows for the production of a  larger number of devices in a single process.\\u201d\\nThe dark current  density under reverse bias was below 1\\u03bcA/cm2 for all devices sizes from 5\\u03bcm  to 100\\u03bcm.\\nThe LEDs suffered a blue-shift in  wavelength as the injection current  density increased. For arrays of 12\\u03bcm LEDs, the wavelength shifted from 648nm to 624nm for injections  between 3A/cm2 and 30A/cm2,  respectively. Standard red 642nm emission occurred at 5A/cm2.\\nThe full-width at half maximum (FWHM) for  the LEDs was around 65nm at low injection, narrowing to 50nm at 30A/cm2. This put a large  chunk of the emissions in the \\u2018orange\\u2019 range (590\\u2013625nm) rather than \\u2018red\\u2019  (625\\u2013750nm).\\nThe researchers comment: \\u201cThe peak wavelength  shift in InGaN quantum wells was  attributed to the quantum-confined Stark effect (QCSE) and the band-filling  effect.\\u201d\\nThe QCSE results from shifts in the energy  levels due to the different combinations of applied electric field and electric fields arising from the  strain-dependent contrasts in the charge polarization of the different In AlGaN  alloys making up the epitaxial structure.\\nThe band-filling effect refers to the  filling up of the conduction and valence bands and localized states (as is  common in high-indium-content InGaN, which tends to have more non-uniform indium  concentrations) at higher current injection  \\u2014 an electron from the top of the conduction band has to transit a larger  energy difference to recombine with a hole, creating a higher-energy/shorter-wavelength  photon.\\nThe \\u2018dominant\\u2019 wavelength, taking into  account the perception of a normal human eye  and reducing it to a single wavelength, was determined, showing that the the  LEDs were more orange than red. The largest 100\\u03bcm LEDs recorded a dominant wavelength between 612nm  and 588nm for injections between 10 and 130A/cm2, respectively. The corresponding  dominant wavelength range for the 5\\u03bcm devices was 610\\u2013583nm.\\n\\nFigure 2: EQE of InGaN/GaN MQW red micro-LEDs with different device sizes.\\nThe peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) ranged from 0.52% for the 5\\u03bcm LED down to 0.36% for 100\\u03bcm (Figure 2). The injections at which the peak occurred  varied between 3A/cm2 and 5A/cm2,  but without any clear trend, suggesting that the differences were due to  process variations. By contrast, the competing red LED  technology based on III-phosphide materials suffers a large shift in peak EQE injection current  with size.\\nThe higher EQE for the smaller InGaN  devices is explained as being due both to the reduction of sidewall  recombination, relative to phosphide-based LEDs, and higher light-extraction  efficiency (LEE).\\nThe carriers in InGaN are more likely to be  trapped in localized states, rather than traveling to the sidewalls for  non-radiative recombination. The small devices also allow more light to escape  rather than being trapped by total internal reflection  effects, increasing LEE.\\nThe team also compares their work with  recent reports from University of California at Santa Barbara  (UCSB) and South China Normal University  for red InGaN micro-LEDs on silicon. The USCB and South China  data points for peak EQE were 0.021% and 2.3%, respectively.\\nThe team sees the 5\\u03bcm device as being particularly suitable for  displays: the peak EQE occurs around 3A/cm2, which corresponds to a low drive current of 0.75\\u03bcA, which could be supplied by mainstream silicon CMOS device drivers.\\nThe researchers suggest that further  developments could enhance the EQE such as by removing the silicon substrate  through wafer bonding, by optimizing the device structure for higher LEE, and  by optimizing the buffer to alleviate strain induced by high indium incorporation.\\nThe team also demonstrate the ability to  produce images by selective wiring on 5\\u03bcm and 12\\u03bcm  LED arrays (Figure 3). The smaller  devices naturally achieved a higher resolution.\\n\\nFigure 3: Images of various arrays being  driven at various injections. \\nGiven the limitations of InGaN LED devices,  the researchers suggest that pulse-width modulation (PWM), rather than  pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM) might be a better method to control LED  brightness. The said limitations include efficiency and wavelength variations  with current injection, hence the desirability of using a fixed current injection amplitude. \\n The researchers found a linear dependence  of light luminance between 476nits and 4148nits (candela/m2) for pulse duty cycles varying between 10% and 90%,  respectively, on a 12\\u03bcm  LED biased at 3.3V, giving current injection of 3A/cm2.\\nThe researchers comment: \\u201cThese  measurements confirmed that it is possible to represent grayscale with red emission without peak shift using PWM in  InGaN/GaN red micro-LED devices.\\u201d \\nTags: InGaN micro-LEDs GaN InGaN MOCVD\\nVisit: https://doi.org/10.1364/OE.525680\\nThe  author Mike Cooke is a freelance technology journalist who has worked in the  semiconductor and advanced technology sectors since 1997.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n \\nFollow us\\r\\n    on X (Twitter)\\n\\n \\nJoin our LinkedIn network\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a92006-2024 Juno Publishing and Media Solutions Ltd.

Our editor-at-large, Caleb Denison, has had his hands full reviewing them over at our YouTube channel, and so far LG and Samsung have impressed him with the LG G4 and Samsung S95D, respectively.\\nIf you're in the market for a new TV, whether that's a new QLED TV, an OLED TV, a mini-LED, or a more traditional LED-LCD set, we take a look at all the year's top models to help you get the one that has the best picture and features for your dollar. (And if you're in a big hurry, check out the best early Prime Day TV deals.)\\nAs far as the best TV brands go, Samsung, Sony, and LG are always quick to impress, but Hisense and TCL deliver some incredible screens as well, and we still think that it's a great time to get into a TV from last year, while the deals are hot.\\nIn the meantime, here's our list of the best TVs to suit a range of features and budgets. Let's dig in.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones / Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tSony A95L QD-OLED\\nThe best TV you can buy right now\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSony Bravia A95L Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOutstanding color accuracy and brightness\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExcellent contrast and luminance\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGreat sound\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGorgeous game mode picture quality\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIncredibly good upscaling\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSome deep features not available at launch\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOur current top pick remains the Sony A95L QD-OLED. When it came out last year, Denison called it the best TV he\\u2019s ever reviewed, so you know you\\u2019re in for some seriously good picture, sound, and other features. And yeah, Sony\\u2019s 2023 flagship is still  a killer TV, that just so happens to be equipped with cutting-edge QD-OLED display tech.\\nFor those unaware, \\u201cQD-OLED\\u201d stands for Quantum Dot-Organic Light Emitting Diode. What we\\u2019ve got here is an OLED backbone, complete with a screen that contains self-emissive pixels. But on top of that, there\\u2019s also a layer of quantum dots built into the A95L, which does wonders for overall color and peak brightness levels; not to mention the supremely wide color gamut you\\u2019ll get to experience. Those are just the fundamentals though, with Sony giving us plenty more to love about this phenomenal TV.\\nIt\\u2019s not too often we get to rave about a TV\\u2019s audio system, but we couldn\\u2019t believe the type of sound quality the A95L is capable of. With powerful representation in the treble, midrange, and bass sectors, you\\u2019d think you were using a great soundbar or surround sound-lite, but nope: it\\u2019s all in the TV speakers, friends.\\nPicture-wise, the list of terrific things to say is nearly endless, but highlights include some of the best color purity and saturation levels we\\u2019ve ever seen on a TV, or at least one with these max nit figures. The A95L also delivers some tremendous 4K upscaling, which not only brings lower-res content closer to Ultra HD quality, but also reduces picture noise and other onscreen artifacts to give you final frames that look clean and sharp. The A95L is also a fantastic TV for modern gaming, especially for those of us who own a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S.\\nPrice-wise, this is going to be one of the most expensive picks on our list, but we really can\\u2019t praise the Sony A95L enough. And if you're on the lookout for a super-great deal on one of last year's flagship sets, now is the time to track down a Sony A95K.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSony A95L QD-OLED\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe best TV you can buy right now\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones / Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tLG G4 evo OLED\\nThe best OLED that LG has ever made\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLG G4 OLED Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOutstanding brightness\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAstounding accuracy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tUnprecedented flexibility\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAwesome gaming performance\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFive-year warranty\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHit-or-miss sound\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFrustrating remote\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe\\u2019re not easily impressed by just any TV. We expect the latest and greatest models to not only floor us with picture and sound, but also surprise us with features and capabilities that wouldn\\u2019t be possible in months and years past. Last year, we were totally gung ho about the amazing LG G3 OLED, a marvel of self-emissive picture that you can still buy -- and you should, as they're likely to go on sale now that the 2024s are here. For now, though, it's the LG G4's time to shine.\\nAnd shine it does. In our LG G4 video review (post coming soon), Denison not only says that \\\"the LG G4 has the best picture quality I've ever tested in a TV,\\\" but that \\\"it's the brightest TV we've tested to date.\\\" This is some high praise, but he does add that getting it there takes a little bit of work in the picture settings. In the end, it has some excellent versatility \\u2014\\u00a0it can be the brightest it can be if you're going to use it in a bright room, or it can be dialed down if your viewing setting is a man cave or light-controlled home theater room, for example. The choice is yours.\\nThere\\u2019s been plenty of fanfare about Samsung and Sony\\u2019s forays into QD-OLED tech, which has enjoyed the reputation of being brighter than OLED. We're big fans of QLED and QD-OLED panels, but now LG is forcing its two fiercest competitors to take heed.\\nWe\\u2019re also pleased to see LG\\u2019s latest chip, the a11 AI processor, put to the test. The speedy new tech brings improved processing speed, unparalleled picture upscaling, lag-free streaming, and brilliant audio performance to LG's flagship lineup.\\nThe LG G4 also supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, Filmmaker Mode, and includes four HDMI 2.1 inputs and LG\\u2019s all-new webOS 24 for all things smart TV.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLG G4 evo OLED\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe best OLED that LG has ever made\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones / Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tSamsung S95D OLED TV\\nSamsung's best for bright rooms\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamsung S95D QD-OLED TV Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExellent brightness\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEye-popping color\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSnappy operation\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGreat gaming features\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAwesome for bright rooms\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnti-glare treatment is polarizing\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBlacks may appear lifted in bright rooms\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWe finally got our hands on Samsung's flagship OLED for 2024, the S95D, an excellently bright and color-accurate QD-OLED TV that has caused a bit of a stir with its new anti-glare coating.\\nThe Samsung S95D boasts impressive brightness, especially for an OLED. Normally OLED TVs struggle in sunny rooms, but the S95D holds its own, making it a great choice for spaces with a lot of natural light. While it's not quite as bright as the LG G4, it still gets plenty bright for most users.\\nLet's talk picture quality. Blacks are deep and inky, and the TV supports HDR10+ and HLG (but not Dolby Vision), creating a stunning contrast that makes movies and shows pop. Colors are vibrant and accurate, and there's even a booster setting that, even though it throws things a tad off from true color accuracy, makes things extra punchy for those who like that sort of thing.\\nBut the S95D's marquee feature that has been dividing TV enthusiasts is its special anti-glare coating that's new to the TV this year. We first saw it demoed at CES earlier this year, and it's cool tech that does a great job at drastically reducing glare, especially in bright rooms. However, it can ever-so-slightly reduce the picture's luster compared to traditional OLED TVs. In a completely dark room, you probably wouldn't notice the difference, but with some light in the room, a keen eye might pick up on it.\\nThe Samsung S95D also surprised us a bit with how good it sounds. Usually, TVs have pretty weak built-in speakers. The S95D's has rear-firing speakers and eight bass transducers that deliver decent low-end rumble. It won't replace a dedicated soundbar, but for casual viewing, it gets the job done. Especially if you plan on mounting this TV on the wall, where the speaker design performs best.\\nThe Samsung S95D is a strong contender for the title of best OLED TV, but we'd be remiss if we didn't also mention that it features Samsung's One Connect box that keeps your cables at bay. One of our only gripes is that it runs Samsung's Tizen operating system, which can be easily remedied by connecting your favorite streaming device instead. If you prioritize absolute picture perfection in a dark room over reflection control, you might want to consider other options. But for most viewers, the S95D is a winner.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSamsung S95D OLED TV\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSamsung's best for bright rooms\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones/Digital Trends / Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tSamsung S95C OLED\\nSamsung's best OLED TV of 2023\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamsung S95C OLED TV Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIncredibly bright colors\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPerfect black levels\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPristine overall picture\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGreat upscaling\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAwesome for gaming\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMediocre sound\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNo Dolby Vision support\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe 2024 Samsung S95D OLED has finally landed, and as you can see, it's a keeper as it's on our list above. But make no mistake, the S95C is still a banger of a TV, and with the new model out now it can be had for a deal, currently going for $1,300 off the MSRP.\\nBut let's get into the specs. The S95C is excellently bright, has a sleek design, and premium features that are still hard to beat. In fact, Denison called the S95C \\\"the best TV Samsung has ever made.\\\" Although it doesn't come with a wall mount, the all-metal stand mount is sturdy, stable, and leaves enough space for a soundbar underneath, but more importantly, it cradles the S95C's One Connect box that was once only found with Samsung's 8K QLED TVs. The One Connect box is a rather ingenious solution for messy and awkward cables at the back of your TV as it puts all those connections in a separate sleek box that connects to the TV with one cable.\\nAs you might expect, picture quality is off the charts. Starting with brightness, peaking at 1,600 nits in our own tests. And that's bananas. True to QLED and QD-OLED panels, this TV will be more than fine in any bright room you want to put it in. Color brightness is also very good and accurate on this TV, with 100% of P3 color space, and 75% of BT.2020, and Denison praised it for having a \\\"super vivid vibe that, when combined with OLED\\u2019s perfect blacks, is simply unmatched by any other TV technology.\\\" However, there is that matter of Samsung still not supporting Dolby Vision, the dynamic HDR format that's supported by several streaming services. If that's a deal breaker for you, and it shouldn't be, then scroll back up to the LG G3.\\nGamers will be delighted by the S95C's Game Mode that supports fast gaming at up to 120Hz, and because it's a Samsung, gamers can also tap into Samsung Gaming Hub for cloud gaming without the console.\\nOne of the other differentiators between the S95C and its closes competitor from last year, the LG G3, is Samsung's array of eight bass transducers on the back of the TV, which, Denison reports, don't really add much to the native sound of the set and you'd still be better off getting a soundbar. Speaking of sound, the S95C does support Dolby Atmos sound, as well as pass through via eARC, but not DTS passthrough, sadly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSamsung S95C OLED\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSamsung's best OLED TV of 2023\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones / Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tLG M3 Wireless OLED\\nPremium picture meets cutting-edge tech\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLG M3 Wireless OLED Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGorgeous OLED picture quality\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLow-latency wireless for gaming\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSolid wireless signal connection\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEasy setup\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGood sound\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWireless box needs true line of sight\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe LG M3 Wireless OLED has arrived to solve a problem that a lot of home theaters struggle with: having too many wires to run. When it comes to power cables, we\\u2019ll always be reliant on a lead and power brick (at least for the foreseeable future), but as far as AV connections go (HDMI and digital optical), this is where TVs like the LG M3 are starting to change the game. In terms of picture quality, the M3 is pretty much toe-to-toe with the amazing LG G3, our favorite OLED this year. But the true calling card feature is the M3\\u2019s ability to wirelessly receive picture and sound from a broadcasting unit called the Zero Connect Box.\\nThe Zero Connect includes three HDMI ports that can push 4K at up to 120Hz (and the second port is eARC/ARC compatible), digital optical, ethernet, two USB-A, and an output for an IR blaster. And as long as the transmitting device is in range of the M3 TV\\u2019s receiver, you\\u2019ll be able to enjoy wireless audio and video. Do keep in mind that if you\\u2019re planning on using a soundbar, you\\u2019ll want to have the Zero Connect located fairly close to the TV, otherwise, you probably won\\u2019t have enough cord length to place the soundbar under the M3.\\nAs mentioned, the picture quality on this model is right on par with the LG G3, and when we tested the M3 ourselves, we experienced zero troubles with latency or any kind of compression or pixelation. This is definitely the kind of next-gen TV that leans on one awesome feature more than any other, and at $5,000 we do wish the Zero Connect box was a little smaller and completely reliable in the signal-range department. But if you told us a year ago that we\\u2019d have the ability to go wireless with our HDMI gear, and the picture and sound would be just as good as running physical cables, we\\u2019d scoff and laugh. But the LG M3 Wireless OLED has proved us wrong.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLG M3 Wireless OLED\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPremium picture meets cutting-edge tech\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones/Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tTCL QM8 mini-LED\\nThe TV most people should buy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTCL QM8 mini-LED TV  Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStunning HDR performance\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tClass-leading brightness\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExcellent black levels\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVirtually no detectable blooming\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVery good color saturation/brightness\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSome motion artifacts\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSure, the LGs, Sonys, and Samsungs are the cream of the crop so far, but the price tags on those panels can be a jagged pill to swallow. May we present to you, then, a TCL TV that has closed the performance-versus-price gap so thoroughly, that it surprised us: the 2023 TCL QM8.\\nWith appeal to an extremely broad audience, the TCL QM8 sits at the top of TCL's new Q class flagship lineup with this 4K mini-LED QLED TV that runs Google TV. As we mentioned in the intro, 2023 has so far been all about brightness, something that TCL promises with the QM8 with its \\\"High Brightness ULTRA LED Backlight\\\" technology. So ... it's bright then?\\nYou betcha. In fact, in our review of the QM8, Caleb Denison's calibration tool is only rated to accurately read up to 2,000 nits of brightness, which is already insanely powerful. The QM8 blew past that, giving readings of up to 3,500 nits in HDR mode before some tweaking settled things to a more consistent 2,500 (TCL's website lists the peak nits at 2,000 though). The TL;DR here is: schnikies, it's bright.\\nBut how about the black levels? While deep inky blacks is the calling card of OLED technology, this mini-LED gets really close, with excellent contrast and support for Dolby Vision IQ, HDR10+, HDR10, and  HLG. Denison was impressed, stating: \\\"The contrast on this TV is just out-of-this-world impressive, partially because it can get so bright, yes, but also because its blacks are remarkably good.\\\" The brightness and black level capabilities make this a great choice for both dark home theater dens and bright rooms.\\nColor-wise, the TCL QM8 is great, too, covering 97% of DCI-P3 and about 76% of BT.2020 color gamuts, and the TV looks excellent out of the box even without calibration. And while Denison did see some motion judder when viewing some higher-quality shows, there's a de-judder option in the settings that can nip that in the bud. But gamers will be pleased with the QM8's support for VRR, and there's an auto game mode with AMD FreeSync Premium Pro.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTCL QM8 mini-LED\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe TV most people should buy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones / Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tSony XR X95L mini-LED\\nOne of the brightest mini-LEDs\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSony Bravia X95L mini-LED TV Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBrilliant contrast\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExcellent color accuracy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSmooth motion\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMinimal blooming and halo\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExcellent gaming features/picture quality\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tQuirks with picture quality with some streaming apps\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSony has plenty of representation in this best TV roundup, but there was no way we were going to pass up the amazing Sony XR X95L mini-LED set. Now, side by side with the also-quite- amazing Sony XR X93L (which is our next featured pick), the X95L really isn\\u2019t too different. What really separates both models is not much more than local dimming capabilities and brightness levels, but if you\\u2019re a nose-to-the-screen videophile with grand expectations, the X95L is probably the set to go with.\\nOver the last couple of years, we\\u2019ve seen mini-LED lighting implemented on more and more TVs, and the results never get old. But what starts to grind our gears is picture maladies like haloing and light bloom. Unless you\\u2019re dealing with an OLED set, you\\u2019re pretty much always going to have to contend with some level of blooming on an LED-driven set, and the X95L is no exception. However, what you\\u2019ll get with this Sony flagship is the most minimal amount of haloing and bloom there could possibly be.\\nThanks to features like XR Backlight Master Drive and XR Triluminos Pro, the X95L\\u2019s picture performance is fine-tuned within an inch of its life, delivering some of the brightest and boldest picture quality we\\u2019ve ever seen. And whether you\\u2019re watching 4K HDR content, or something relatively low-res, the X95L is going to ensure that your source is as visually rich as possible. That\\u2019s on top of features like HDMI 2.1, an immersive gaming dashboard for PS5 and Xbox optimizations, as well as one of our favorite smart TV platforms, Google TV.\\nAs of right now, the only X95L size that seems to be available is the 85-inch model. When quantities improve, you should also be able to grab this set in 65 and 75-inch sizes, but there was no way we were going to miss the opportunity to dish about it. For now though, if you\\u2019re looking for some slightly smaller big-screen options, the Sony XR X93L is just as good as the X95L, save for those extra local dimming zones and higher nit numbers.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSony XR X95L mini-LED\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOne of the brightest mini-LEDs\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones / Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tHisense U8N\\nOur favorite Hisense\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHisense U8N Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIntense brightness\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDeep blacks/contrast\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVibrant, accurate color\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGreat sound\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOverly bright HDR\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPoor off-angle viewing\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\u2019s getting harder and harder for us to call Hisense a \\u201cbudget-friendly\\u201d brand. That kind of connotation just doesn\\u2019t line up with the type of picture and sound performance you\\u2019ll get from a Hisense set, especially if you\\u2019ve got your sights set on one of its U8 offerings.\\nOver the last couple of years, we\\u2019ve had the continued opportunity to review several Hisense sets, including a handful of its flagship models. The 2024 Hisense U8N is the newest addition to the Hisense family, and we were simply blown away by the picture quality and medley of features this bad boy brings to the table.\\nThe U8N is a powerful TV that delivers a brilliant and colorful image in both SDR and HDR viewing modes. When measuring nit output for these settings, our reviewer measured peak brightness at 1,300 nits in SDR, with around 3,500 for specular highlights in HDR. There\\u2019s no doubting the fact that the U8N can get very bright, but it also delivers the kind of incredible contrast numbers that might fool some folks into thinking it\\u2019s actually an OLED set.\\nWhile it suffers a bit in the viewing angle department, if you can arrange your furniture appropriately, we have no doubt that the Hisense U8N is one of the best bright TVs on the market for 2024.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHisense U8N\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOur favorite Hisense\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones/Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tSony XR X93L mini-LED\\nPremium performance without the Sony tax\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSony Bravia X93L mini-LED Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExcellent motion resolution\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStellar color accuracy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBright, punchy HDR performance\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSolid black levels\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSome backlight blooming/halo\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPoor off-angle performance\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDepending on how nerdy you are in the TV space, you may or may not notice that Sony's 2023 X93L mini-LED TV looks exactly the same as 2022's flagship mini-LED, the X95K. Well, actually, apart from what Sony says is some software improvements, it is exactly the same. And that's not a bad thing, because the X95K was an excellently bright, colorful, and contrast-capable TV backed by Sony's powerful Cognitive Processor XR. So what's the fuss, then? Sony's TVs tend to go for a premium (don't get us started on the \\\"Sony tax\\\"), so the big takeaway here is that the X93L is a great way for you to get in on all the premium performance of the X95K and save your wallet in the process.\\nFor a comparison, the 65-inch X95K was $2,800 at launch. The 65-inch X93L was $2,200 at launch. Boom, you just saved $600 for a sweet TV. But let's talk specs, shall we? In our review, Caleb Denison's assessment of the X93L's picture performance out of the box was \\\"excellent,\\\" with how brightness tests revealing an impressive peak of 1,800 nits. Color and contrast are killer, too, and the TV supports HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Vision. There are also some presets for movie lovers in the form of an IMAX Enhanced mode and a Netflix calibrated mode, too.\\nDenison praised the X93L's \\\"stellar motion processing and low-resolution content upscaling, excellent tone-mapping, and color accuracy,\\\" all calling-cards of Sony. And all that new software stuff we mentioned includes a new Eco Dashboard for managing eco settings, some additional black level adjustments for seeing darker scenes better, and a new gaming dashboard that lets you toggle VRR on and off between 60Hz and 120Hz, which gamers will rejoice over.\\nOne of the only downfalls Denison could find with the X93L is the inclusion of only two HDMI 2.1 inputs, whereas most new TVs have four. The X93L is Available in 65, 75, and 85-inch models.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSony XR X93L mini-LED\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPremium performance without the Sony tax\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones / Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tSony X90L LED\\nBest value Sony LCD TV\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSony Bravia X90L  Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPunchy HDR performance\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOustanding color and grayscale accuracy\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExcellent motion handling\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSolid value\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMinimal blooming/halo\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tUnimpressive sound\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen it comes to mid-tier TVs, Sony is a little quieter these days than it used to be. But that doesn\\u2019t mean the Bravia stalwart is only focusing on flagship sets, because the 2023 X90L is hard proof that Sony always means business, even at lower prices. What we\\u2019ve got here is a bold and brilliant full-array LED set that delivers exceptional HDR performance, next-level gaming specs, and the algorithmic king of smart TV platforms, Google TV. Available in 55-, 65-, 75-, 85-, and 98-inch sizes, whatever viewing space you\\u2019re working with, there\\u2019s an X90L to match the room.\\nOur review took a hard look at the Sony X90L, and was more than prepared to start issuing demerits for the TV\\u2019s relative lack of dimming zones when compared to the TCL QM8 and Hisense U8K. There\\u2019s also the fact that both of the latter are equipped with mini-LED lighting systems, which basically guarantees excellent brightness and colors with minimal light blooming. But even though the Sony X90L uses a less advanced LED setup, the TV still delivers a phenomenal picture. In fact, when it comes to color accuracy, our X90L test results came out on top (with the TCL QM8 and Hisense U8K trailing after).\\nNow in terms of light blooming and haloing, we\\u2019re not totally in the clear. In our testing of the X90L, we noted a bit of both image maladies when viewing certain content; and when it comes to the X90L\\u2019s sound, you should definitely be thinking about a soundbar to go with your new TV purchase (re: not great). But these are small grievances that are easy to forgive when observing the bigger picture (TV pun intended). The Sony X90L isn\\u2019t a perfect LED TV, but it does an admirable job at handling everything from HDR films to high frame-rate PS5 gaming, and it\\u2019s a pretty good price.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSony X90L LED\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest value Sony LCD TV\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones / Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tHisense UX ULED\\nAn empire of illumination\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHisense UX mini-LED TV Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe brightest TV we've reviewed\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOutstanding black levels and contrast\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPiercingly bright colors leap off the screen\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOutstanding sound system\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMotion resolution needs improvement\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tUpscaling should be better that this price\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOver the last few years, Hisense has been really showing up, especially when it comes to peak brightness levels. We were floored by the chart-topping luminance of the U8K and U7K models, but nothing would prepare us for the powerful punch to the eyeballs that is the Hisense 85-inch UX mini-LED. It\\u2019s only available in one size, and it\\u2019s a whopping 85 inches, so this recommendation is for all you big-screen savants with the wall space or TV stand to support this monster.\\nWith 5,000 dimming zones and 2,500 nits of peak brightness, Hisense promises some pretty big numbers with the UX, and guess what? It truly delivers. In fact, Digital Trends' TV reviewer Caleb Denison clocked just over 4,000 nits during an HDR picture test, and for those unaware, that\\u2019s a near-unbelievable figure. Beyond its almighty backlighting, the UX is also an exceptional TV when it comes to color and contrast.\\nDo keep in mind, though, that some of the out-of-the-box settings are rather dismal. Denison recommended setting the TV to Theater Day, Theater Night, or Filmmaker Mode for the most accurate saturation and contrast levels. Presets like Standard and Vivid are normal defaults, but they don\\u2019t quite make the grade here. We\\u2019re also dealing with a 120Hz panel, which is great for traditional movies and shows, but when it comes time to watch 4K HDR content, or fire up some PS5 or Xbox Series X/S titles, the motion clarity can feel just a little draggy.\\nAs far as sound goes, the UX features a built-in sub and up-firing speakers for decent surround virtualization. The TV is also built on the Google TV operating system, giving you access to popular entertainment platforms like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video.\\nThe Hisense 85-inch UX mini-LED isn\\u2019t the TV for everyone, but if you\\u2019re all about breathtaking lighting on a big screen, the UX should be at the top of your list.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHisense UX ULED\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAn empire of illumination\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones / Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tSamsung QN90C\\nA killer Samsung QLED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSamsung QN90C Neo QLED Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tClass-leading HDR performance\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExcellent black levels, backlight control\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOutstanding color performance\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPowerful processing\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPremium design and build\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFrustrating Smart TV OS\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLofty price\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Samsung QN90C is a stunning 4K TV, and if you\\u2019re looking to get a premium set without dipping your toes into the $3,000-plus flagship pool, Samsung\\u2019s latest Neo QLED dazzles for more reasons than one. For starters, it\\u2019s hard to beat the kind of punchy HDR performance you\\u2019ll get here. Without having to dial in ultra-bright picture settings, we found that the QN90C delivered incredible peak brightness levels when using filmmaker mode. Now although the real peak brightness laurels (the QN90C peaks at around 2,000 nits for SDR and HDR viewing) are reserved for the amazing Samsung S95C, the QN90C is no straggler. In fact, when compared to TCL\\u2019s QM8 and Hisense\\u2019s U8K, this Samsung has the better overall picture quality.\\nIn our testing of the QN90C, we used a number of low-resolution and low bit-depth content to see just how efficiently the TV could handle 4K upscaling (which is no easy feat). Compared to the aforementioned TCL QM8 and Hisense U8K, we found that the QN90C was better at reducing color banding, pixelization, and posterization; so if you\\u2019re looking for the kind of TV that can enhance whatever low quality streams or super-old DVDs you\\u2019re tossing at it, the QN90C more than delivers. We\\u2019re also glad to report that you\\u2019ll have your pick of four full-bandwidth HDMI 2.1 inputs, each of which supports refresh rates up to 144Hz.\\nAnd if you\\u2019re really on the fence about this Neo QLED, we\\u2019ll happily push you over with some other good news: Samsung\\u2019s switchover to ADS panels proved to be a solid move for off-angle viewing, and thanks to mini-LED backlighting, the black levels on this bad boy are awesome, too. Sure, it may not be on par with an LG OLED (or the S95C), but the QN90C still screams \\u201cpremium,\\u201d but without getting into absolutely-need-to-finance-this territory.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSamsung QN90C\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tA killer Samsung QLED\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZeke Jones / Digital Trends\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tLG C3 OLED evo\\nAnother great LG OLED\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLG C3 OLED TV Review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPros\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDelightful contrast\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tExcellent color performance\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVery good processing\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tKiller gaming features\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFive-year warranty\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCons\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLow-level color shift\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tToo-frequent updates\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is there to say about the LG C3 OLED that hasn\\u2019t already been said? While the C series isn't the brand's flagship (that honor goes to the aforementioned G Series), the C3 OLED still packs quite the punch in the picture department. Not to mention that you can save a tidy pile of cash, especially since it's last year's model and the 2024s are trickling in.\\nThere are a few key differences between the 2023 C3 and G3 models that could make or break a C3 purchase for some folks, though. One is that the G3 is designed for a completely flush wall-mounting job, and comes with a proprietary LG mount. If you\\u2019re planning on tabletop placement though, the G3\\u2019s stand is sold separately, whereas the C3 comes with a pedestal.\\nAnother difference is that the C3 gets a little less bright than the G3. This is because the latter is equipped with LG\\u2019s Micro Lens Array technology, which allows the G3 to get up to 150% brighter than the G2 lineup. Along with bigger brightness, MLA also brings wider viewing angles. But we digress!\\nWith the exception of the flush design and MLA brightness, the LG C3 has all the guts and ports of the flagship G3, including LG\\u2019s a9 AI Processor Gen6, four HDMI 2.1 ports, and some added luminance via LG\\u2019s Brightness Booster.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLG C3 OLED evo\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAnother great LG OLED\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMore\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrequently Asked Questions\\n\\n\\nWhat size 4K TV should I buy?\\nThe answer to that depends on many factors, including your stylistic preferences, the size of the room, and how far away you'll be sitting. Take a look at our guide to choosing the perfect TV size for you. \\n\\nWhat should you be aware of when it comes to viewing angles for your TV?\\nIf you want to enjoy your TV from a variety of viewing positions, you'll need a TV with wide viewing angles. Of the two main LCD panel types (IPS and VA), IPS panels offer the greatest viewing angles. However, this can sometimes come at the cost of worse contrast. OLED TVs offer both excellent contrast and viewing angles, compared to their QLED counterparts, which are best watched from the center position. \\n\\nWhat is QLED?\\nQLED stands for quantum dot LED TV, and it uses a layer of tiny particles to enhance an LED TV's color accuracy without diminishing brightness. QLED TVs still don't deliver the perfect blacks of OLED TVs, but the newest ones come very, very close. Because QLED TVs often have powerful backlights that use hundred (or in the case of mini-LED, thousands) of LEDs, they can get brighter than the brightest OLED TVs.\\nYou may want to check out our article that covers QLED vs. OLED TV: What\\u2019s the difference, and why does it matter? \\n\\nWhat is OLED?\\nOLED stands for organic light-emitting diode, and these TVs are notable for their ability to produce perfect blacks and what is sometimes referred to as \\\"infinite\\\" contrast. These TVs achieve this through their ability to completely shut down the light they emit on a pixel-by-pixel basis, something QLED TVs can't do because they rely on a separate backlight to create brightness. You can block a lot of the light produced by a backlight, but not 100%. \\n\\nWhat is the best Roku TV?\\nThese are the best Roku TVs. Roku has also started manufacturing its own \\\"Roku-made\\\" TVs, which are on store shelves now. \\n\\nHow well does 4K TV upscaling work?\\nThat depends on the TV, but as a general rule of thumb, the better (and more expensive) the TV, the better the upscaling. \\n\\nAre budget 4K TVs any good?\\nAlmost all new TVs are 4K, so there are plenty of fantastic options to choose from at the lower end of the pricing scale. Don't expect a standard LED TV to rival an OLED or QLED, though \\u2014 set your expectations accordingly. We recommend looking for a quantum dot LED TV (QLED) model, as these will offer the best picture quality at lower prices. \\n\\nCan a 4K TV work well as a PC monitor?\\nYes, so long as your computer has an HDMI output. Adapters can be used for other output types but frequently do not pass along audio. \\n\\nDo 4K TVs usually have Alexa, Google Assistant, or Siri?\\nMost modern TVs can be paired with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant\\u00a0through either an Amazon Echo, Fire TV, or Google Home device. Some televisions even have them built-in, eliminating the need for a smart speaker.\\nRight now, there are no TVs that have Siri built-in. Those that support AirPlay 2 and HomeKit, however, can be controlled using Siri on an iOS device, such as an iPad, iPhone, HomePod, or HomePod Mini, as well as a Mac. \\n\\nDo 4K TVs have problems with burn-in?\\nOLED TVs are the only type of 4K TVs that have the potential to suffer from burn-in, though it's incredibly uncommon. Unless you like to leave the same news channel playing for eight hours a day, seven days a week for weeks on end, you probably don't need to worry about it. \\n\\nHow do we test TVs?\\nTVs are a big priority for us at Digital Trends, and our resident TV expert, Caleb Denison, puts all the best TVs from every TV manufacturerr through their paces. Check out our detailed rundown of how we test TVs in our reviews. \\n\\nGlossary of terms\\nHere\\u2019s a rundown of some of the most common terms associated with today\\u2019s TV technology.\\n4K Ultra HD\\nThis refers to a display resolution that is four times that of 1080p HD. A 4K Ultra HD TV\\u2019s pixel resolution is a 3,840 x 2,160 grid in a 16:9 aspect ratio, resulting in nearly 8.3 million pixels. This increase in density adds striking detail and realism to an image and allows larger screens to be viewed from closer distances without individual pixels becoming visible.\\nHigh dynamic range (HDR)\\nHigh dynamic range is probably most familiar to people through the HDR mode on their digital cameras. It\\u2019s designed to deliver a picture that has greater details in the shadows and highlights, plus a wider range of colors. HDR in televisions pursues the same goal. The color palette is wider, blacks are deeper, and whites are brighter.\\nPresently, there are two major HDR formats: HDR10 and Dolby Vision, with a third \\u2014 HDR10+ \\u2014 beginning to show up on new models, particularly those from Samsung. The first is the HDR standard, but Dolby Vision offers a premium experience. Consider a TV that supports both. HLG (hybrid log gamma)\\u00a0is another recent addition to the HDR collection, which supports over-the-air (OTA) broadcast content with HDR.\\nFull-array local dimming (FALD)\\nThis refers to an LED TV\\u2019s backlighting system. A FALD display contains an array of LEDs spread out in a grid behind an LCD panel, rather than just at the edges of the TV. This LED array is broken up into zones that can be dimmed when necessary to achieve better black levels. Another benefit is more uniform brightness across the screen.\\nWide color gamut (WCG)\\nThese are the expanded color reproduction abilities of a 4K Ultra HD TV, which are closer than ever to what we see in a digital cinema. By approaching (or sometimes exceeding) the Digital Cinema Initiative\\u2019s (DCI) P3 color specification, a 4K UHD TV can produce billions of more colors than a 1080p HD TV.\\nQuantum dots\\nA layer of film loaded with tiny nanocrystal semiconductors is placed in a TV\\u2019s display panel to help produce a more accurate array of colors. Quantum dots work by producing a purer form of white light from a TV\\u2019s backlighting system, which helps the TV\\u2019s color filter perform more accurately.\\nPhosphor-coated LED\\nAn alternative to Quantum Dots, phosphor-coated LEDs have a chemical coating to alter the light\\u2019s output. When used in a TV, this results in a purer backlight that\\u2019s more easily manipulated by a TV\\u2019s color filter, resulting in a wide color gamut and increased color accuracy.\\nHDMI 2.1\\nThe latest version of the HDMI spec. It offers new enhancements for video games like variable refresh rate (VRR) and automatic low-latency mode (ALLM) and the ability to pass 4K signals to the TV at up to 120Hz, for ultra-smooth motion. HDMI 2.1 is a requirement for 8K video sources like the PlayStation 5\\u00a0and Xbox Series X. For most non-gamers, HDMI 2.1 is a nice way to future-proof yourself but it's nowhere near a necessity yet.\\nHDCP 2.3\\nThe latest version of the High-Bandwidth Digital Content Protection technology, which provides copy prevention specifically of 4K Ultra HD and 8K content. Any source device that requires HDCP 2.3 will require a TV with an HDCP 2.3-compliant HDMI port for a compatible connection.\\nHEVC (H.265)\\nStands for \\u201cHigh-Efficiency Video Coding.\\u201d A compression technology developed to make large 4K UHD video files smaller and, therefore, easier to stream over broadband Internet connections. HEVC is said to double the data compression ratio over H.264, the predominant encoding technology used today for 1080p videos while retaining the same video quality. A smart TV or streaming set-top box must be able to decode HEVC to playback 4K Ultra HD video from sites like Netflix and Amazon Prime Video.\\nVP9\\nAn alternative to HEVC developed by Google and used predominantly for encoding 4K Ultra HD YouTube videos. For a smart TV or streaming set-top box to play 4K Ultra HD YouTube videos, it must be able to decode VP9 videos.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tEditors\\u2019 Recommendations\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Prime Day TV deals in 2024: Sony, Samsung, TCL and more\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe giant 77-inch Samsung S90C OLED TV has a $1,300 price cut\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis 50-inch TV is only $190 during Amazon\\u2019s early Prime Day sale\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe 8 best QLED TVs for 2024\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest QLED TV deals: Samsung, TCL, LG and Vizio\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tTopics\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Products\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTVs\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDerek Malcolm\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tContributing Editor, A/V\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tinstagram\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlinkedin\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nEmail \\n\\n\\nDerek Malcolm is a Toronto-based technology journalist, editor, and content specialist whose work has appeared in publications such as Toronto Life, Canadian Business, The Globe and Mail, Business Insider, Today's Parent, and The Huffington Post.

Unlike traditional LED-LCDs, OLED TVs contain no actual light source. Thanks to the organic makeup of an OLED, each individual pixel on the screen is self-emissive and can be toggled on or off. This is how these TVs are able to achieve such arresting and accurate picture quality.\\nFor years, LG has been the predominant player in the OLED game, but now Samsung and Sony produce some excellent OLEDs too. In fact, every OLED manufacturer makes more than one set, so choosing the model that\\u2019s best for you isn\\u2019t just a matter of what brand to go with. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRead more\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAudio / Video\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLG\\u2019s best OLED TV finally has a discount\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nWhen it comes to chart-topping TVs, one brand you can always rely on is LG. Renowned for its impressive OLED lineup that spans several years now, LG has a reputation for this immersive, detail-rich picture technology, and we found an amazing deal we just had to bring to your attention: For a limited time, you can buy the all-new LG 55-inch G4 OLED for $2,300. This 2024 set has only been out for a few months, and it normally goes for $2,600. Our list of the best TVs of 2024 calls this the \\\"best OLED that LG has ever made.\\\"\\nWhy you should buy the LG 55-inch G4 OLED\\nThe LG G4 Series is the brand\\u2019s signature TV for 2024. And while we see OLED TV deals often enough, it\\u2019s rare that such a new set gets the markdown treatment so soon. When it comes to overall picture quality and motion performance, it\\u2019s hard to beat the many accolades the G4 brings to the table. You\\u2019ll get 4K at 120Hz across all four HDMI 2.1 ports, in addition to key gaming features like VRR, ALLM, and near-instant response times. \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRead more\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAudio / Video\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest 8K TV deals: Samsung and LG starting at $1,999\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nWhile the best TV deals are made up of mostly 4K TVs, there are some 8K TV deals out there if you\\u2019re trying to ensure your home theater has the highest resolution currently available. There are a number of sizes 8K TVs come in, so you can often find them among the best 65-inch TV deals, best 70-inch TV deals, best 75-inch TV deals, and even the best 85-inch TV deals. Awhile there aren\\u2019t nearly as many 8K TV deals going on as you\\u2019ll find among other resolutions, there are a few worth taking a look at.

Here, we report results from the RATE-AF trial wearables study, which was designed to compare heart rate in older, multimorbid patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and heart failure who were randomized to treatment with either digoxin or beta-blockers. Heart rate (n\\u2009=\\u2009143,379,796) and physical activity (n\\u2009=\\u200923,704,307) intervals were obtained from 53 participants (mean age 75.6\\u2009years (s.d. 8.4), 40% women) using a wrist-worn wearable linked to a smartphone for 20\\u2009weeks. Heart rates in participants treated with digoxin versus beta-blockers were not significantly different (regression coefficient 1.22 (95% confidence interval (CI) \\u22122.82 to 5.27; P\\u2009=\\u20090.55); adjusted 0.66 (95% CI \\u22123.45 to 4.77; P\\u2009=\\u20090.75)). No difference in heart rate was observed between the two groups of patients after accounting for physical activity (P\\u2009=\\u20090.74) or patients with high activity levels (\\u226530,000\\u2009steps per week; P\\u2009=\\u20090.97). Using a convolutional neural network designed to account for missing data, we found that wearable device data could predict New York Heart Association functional class 5\\u2009months after baseline assessment similarly to standard clinical measures of electrocardiographic heart rate and 6-minute walk test (F1 score 0.56 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.70) versus 0.55 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.68); P\\u2009=\\u20090.88 for comparison). The results of this study indicate that digoxin and beta-blockers have equivalent effects on heart rate in atrial fibrillation at rest and on exertion, and suggest that dynamic monitoring of individuals with arrhythmia using wearable technology could be an alternative to in-person assessment.

Here, we report results from the RATE-AF trial wearables study, which was designed to compare heart rate in older, multimorbid patients with permanent atrial fibrillation and heart failure who were randomized to treatment with either digoxin or beta-blockers. Heart rate (n\\u2009=\\u2009143,379,796) and physical activity (n\\u2009=\\u200923,704,307) intervals were obtained from 53 participants (mean age 75.6\\u2009years (s.d. 8.4), 40% women) using a wrist-worn wearable linked to a smartphone for 20\\u2009weeks. Heart rates in participants treated with digoxin versus beta-blockers were not significantly different (regression coefficient 1.22 (95% confidence interval (CI) \\u22122.82 to 5.27; P\\u2009=\\u20090.55); adjusted 0.66 (95% CI \\u22123.45 to 4.77; P\\u2009=\\u20090.75)). No difference in heart rate was observed between the two groups of patients after accounting for physical activity (P\\u2009=\\u20090.74) or patients with high activity levels (\\u226530,000\\u2009steps per week; P\\u2009=\\u20090.97). Using a convolutional neural network designed to account for missing data, we found that wearable device data could predict New York Heart Association functional class 5\\u2009months after baseline assessment similarly to standard clinical measures of electrocardiographic heart rate and 6-minute walk test (F1 score 0.56 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.70) versus 0.55 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.68); P\\u2009=\\u20090.88 for comparison). The results of this study indicate that digoxin and beta-blockers have equivalent effects on heart rate in atrial fibrillation at rest and on exertion, and suggest that dynamic monitoring of individuals with arrhythmia using wearable technology could be an alternative to in-person assessment.

In patients with cardiovascular disease, this often requires multiple clinical visits to obtain tests such as electrocardiograms (ECG) for assessment of heart rate, or 6-minute walk (6MW) tests to appraise physical capacity. These in-hospital measurements are time-consuming, costly and not dynamic, providing a limited \\u2018snapshot\\u2019 of that person\\u2019s functional status1,2. Wearable technology can provide continuous measurement of physiological parameters3,4,5. However the large volume of data acquired may need advanced analytics, taking account of the lower quality compared with medical devices or frequent missing values6.A prime example of the potential clinical value of wearable sensor data could be therapy choice and dose adjustment for heart rate control in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), an increasingly common rhythm disorder. There is a limited evidence base on this topic; for example, digoxin has typically been considered a poorly effective drug for controlling heart rate, particularly on exertion, although this is based on acute studies only7. Wearables offer an opportunity to assess each patient in their own environment, with longer-term evaluation better reflecting the extended time taken to achieve therapeutic benefit from digoxin8, and properly account for physical activity.Although there is considerable potential for consumer-wearable devices to contribute to cardiovascular disease management, there are few robust studies independent of manufacturers that can highlight opportunities as well as limitations in older, multimorbid patients9. Embedded in a randomized controlled trial to mitigate the effects of unmeasured or unknown confounders10, we hypothesized that a wrist-worn wearable could: (1) address whether digoxin is inferior to beta-blockers for longer-term heart rate control in patients with AF at rest and on exertion; (2) adjust for differences in individual physical activity; and (3) explore whether wearable sensor data are comparable with conventional measurements for the prediction of clinical progress, and ultimately, aid longer-term patient management.ResultsOne hundred and sixty patients were randomized to digoxin or beta-blocker therapy in the RAte control Therapy Evaluation in permanent Atrial Fibrillation (RATE-AF) trial, of whom 72 (36 from each treatment arm) were eligible to participate in a substudy that provided a wrist-worn wearable and a connected smartphone. The design and deployment of the study were aided by a patient and public involvement team11. The remaining participants had completed the main trial or did not have sufficient time left for data collection (Fig. 1). Of those eligible, 8 in the digoxin group and 11 in the beta-blocker group declined to participate, principally because they did not want to use a wearable device or attend further trial appointments. The characteristics of those who declined were similar to the participating cohort, apart from more women declining and with a lower 6MW distance (Extended Data Table 1).Fig. 1: RATE-AF wearables substudy flowchart.Flowchart for the wearables study enrollment.Full size imageFifty-three participants were enrolled in the substudy (Extended Data Fig. 1), with mean age at randomization of 75.6\\u2009years (s.d. 8.4; range 61 to 90 years) and 40% women. Twenty-eight participants (53%) had been randomized to digoxin and 25 (47%) to beta-blockers a mean of 30\\u2009weeks before their entry into the wearables substudy (s.d. 8\\u2009weeks; range 12 to 46 weeks). Both groups were well balanced with respect to demographics and clinical measurements (Table 1), with the most common comorbidities being hypertension (74%) and heart failure (45%). There were more patients with a formal diagnosis of heart failure in the digoxin group, but ECG-derived left-ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) measured in a blinded fashion at the start of the trial was similar for both groups: 55.7% (s.d. 8.8%) for digoxin versus 55.4% (s.d. 9.0%) for beta-blockers. One patient from each arm was lost to follow-up.Table 1 Baseline characteristicsFull size tableHeart rate at the start of the substudy was 79.4\\u2009beats per minute (bpm; s.d. 12.2) in those randomized to digoxin and 73.1\\u2009bpm (s.d. 14.3) for beta-blockers, with one patient in each group presenting at that visit in sinus rhythm. The capacity for physical activity was similar in both groups at baseline, with a median 6MW distance of 351\\u2009m for digoxin (i.q.r. 120\\u2013454) and 357\\u2009m for beta-blockers (i.q.r. 295\\u2013411). Symptoms of AF and heart failure were reported in all patients (100%), with modified European Heart Rhythm Association (mEHRA) class 2a or above, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II or above. At the trial mid-point, the mean dose of digoxin used was 157\\u2009\\u00b5g (s.d. 10\\u2009\\u00b5g) with a serum digoxin level of 0.79\\u2009ng\\u2009ml\\u22121 (s.d. 0.29); the mean dose in the beta-blocker group was 3.2\\u2009mg of bisoprolol (s.d. 1.9). The duration of the wearable substudy was a median of 23\\u2009weeks (i.q.r. 4\\u201338). There was consistent use of the wrist-worn wearable (more so than the smartphone), with 90.4% of participants using this every day for the last 7\\u2009days before the interim review (Extended Data Table 2).Wearable-acquired heart rate and physical activityPer patient, the mean duration of ambulatory sensor data collected was 20\\u2009weeks (s.d. 7), with an average of 2,623,951 heart rate data points for each patient treated with digoxin (s.d. 907,697) and 2,796,367 for each patient treated with beta-blocker (s.d. 811,956). Across all patients there were 143,379,796 data intervals collected for heart rate and 23,704,307 for corresponding physical activity (Table 2). Figure 2 highlights the considerable variability within and across individual patients despite appropriate rate control therapy in terms of heart rate, response to exertion and the correlation between heart rate and physical activity.Table 2 Sensor data from the wearable deviceFull size tableFig. 2: Wearable device data for measurement of heart rate and physical activity.a, Examples of data capture for heart rate (red lines) and step count (green bars) using a wrist-worn wearable and smartphone over a single 24-h period for two individual patients with AF and heart failure. b, Correlations between daytime 10-s intervals of heart rate and physical activity for 50 patients who remained in AF at each visit. Light blue columns indicate the range of positive and negative correlations between heart rate and physical activity, with medians indicated by dark blue bars (correlation <0.19, very weak; 0.20\\u20130.59, weak to moderate).Full size imageDigoxin versus beta-blockersWeekly averages of heart rate were no different when comparing patients randomized to digoxin or beta-blockers (Extended Data Table 3). Accounting for all repeated measurements over time, there was no significant difference in heart rate comparing digoxin and beta-blocker therapy using the wearable sensors (Fig. 3). There was no interaction seen according to gender (Pinteraction = 0.39). The unadjusted regression coefficient for digoxin versus beta-blockers was 1.22 (95% CI \\u22122.82 to 5.27; P\\u2009=\\u20090.55), and 0.66 when adjusted for age, gender, diagnosis of heart failure and N-terminal pro-hormone B-natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) (95% CI \\u22123.45 to 4.77; P\\u2009=\\u20090.75). There remained no difference in heart rate between the digoxin and beta-blocker groups after accounting for physical activity (P\\u2009=\\u20090.74). Post-hoc adjusted subgroup analysis according to activity levels found no difference in heart rate between digoxin and beta-blockers in those with low weekly-averaged activity (<15,000\\u2009steps per week; 298 weeks from 44 patients; P\\u2009=\\u20090.48), minimum recommended activity (15,000\\u201330,000\\u2009steps per week; 316\\u2009weeks from 37 patients; P\\u2009=\\u20090.47) or recommended activity (\\u226530,000\\u2009steps per week; 417\\u2009weeks from 33 patients; P\\u2009=\\u20090.97).Fig. 3: Heart rate data from the wearable device.The start of the wearables study was preceded by a period of dose adjustment and stabilization (mean of 30\\u2009weeks from randomization). a, Mean (solid line) and s.d.

F1 scores (combining precision and recall) were used to compare the CNN model for prediction of NYHA class at the end of the trial (Extended Data Table 4), with chance returning an F1 score of 0.35. The wearables CNN yielded an F1 score of 0.56 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.70); Fig. 4. This was equivalent to a model generated from conventional trial parameters (ECG heart rate and 6MW test results), which returned an F1 score of 0.55 (95% CI 0.41 to 0.68); P\\u2009=\\u20090.88 for patient-level comparison with wearables CNN. The wearable data appeared independent of clinical factors such as age, gender and body mass index, with similar F1 score when combining wearable data with clinical factors (0.58; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.73). The corresponding areas under the receiver operator characteristic curves were 0.73 for ECG heart rate and 6MW test, 0.77 for the wearables CNN and 0.78 for wearables plus clinical factors.Fig. 4: Prediction of clinical progress with a neural network based on wearable data.F1 scores combining precision and recall of each model are presented along with 95% CI for the prediction of NYHA functional class at the end of follow-up (mean 5\\u2009months); an F1 score of 0.35 (dashed line) is equivalent to chance.

Embedded in a randomized trial, the study provides robust information on the value, but also the limitations of using these devices. The commonly held view originating from acute trials that digoxin is inferior to beta-blockers for heart rate control in AF was not seen in this longer-term study. No difference in heart rate was seen when considering more than 140 million data points at rest and on exertion during a 20-week period. The equivalence of digoxin to beta-blockers held after accounting for individual differences in day-to-day physical activity, and no difference in heart rate was evident even in periods with high activity. Although limited by the number of patients, the wearable sensor data appeared to be comparable with conventional trial outcomes for prediction of a clinical outcome (in this case, functional class), but required the development of a neural network pipeline for appropriate analytics. Standardization of these approaches could lead to wearable devices contributing to, or even replacing resource-intensive clinical tests and visits in the future.The majority of clinical trials in cardiovascular research utilize in-person periodic testing that not only requires patient and staff attendance, but is time-constrained in an environment unlike the patient\\u2019s own surroundings. Wearables offer an exciting possibility for patient-directed data collection that better reflects real-life day-to-day variations in heart rate and physical activity12. In this study, a neural network that was self-training was designed to provide value from the vast amount of information collected by wearables, and address key issues such as inconsistent and missing data. The performance of the wearable neural network was not dependent on clinical factors, and for prediction of future NYHA class was equivalent to (but not better than) conventional parameters such as a 12-lead ECG and 6MW testing. F1 scores >0.5 indicate an acceptable balance between precision and recall, and the wearable model score of 0.56 was significantly better than chance (in this case, 0.35). Further development, testing and validation of these approaches is clearly required. Of note, the trial recruited older patients (mean age 76\\u2009years, range up to 90\\u2009years) who indicated the use of wearables was appealing to monitor and improve their own functional capacity.Several studies have utilized wearable devices in cardiovascular research. The Apple smartwatch and Fitbit studies used photoplethysmography to identify new AF13,14, and there are many different devices being used across heart failure to quantify patient physiology15. Early optimism has already started to fade somewhat, and one retrospective matched study in the US found that patients using wearable devices accessed more healthcare but with no difference in heart rate16. It remains to be seen how these consumer-bought, nonmedical devices will be integrated into routine care, with or without the acceptance of healthcare professionals1,17. Further randomized trials are needed to understand whether continuous monitoring can provide a personalized assessment of treatment response, or help to identify subphenotypes of disease. Similarly, approaches to transparent and validated artificial intelligence (AI) remain in their infancy18. AI has demonstrated an ability to go beyond our current linear understanding of disease trajectory and interactions, with the ability to personalize diagnostic and therapeutic strategies even in multimorbid conditions19,20. Despite the potential benefits of AI, broader use in clinical practice requires an approach guided by strong methodological principles6.AF is a key public health issue, predicted to double in prevalence over the next few decades21. Recent evidence suggests that cognitive decline and vascular dementia should be added to the list of adverse events suffered by patients with AF22,23. New technologies have rapidly increased our ability to detect AF, but how these should be implemented in clinical practice remains unclear9. Despite permanent AF being the most common \\u2018type\\u2019 of AF24, there is a remarkable lack of research to support decision-making and improve patient quality of life7,25,26,27. Treatment choices for heart rate control are often made based on evidence from heart failure trials; however, the reduction in mortality from beta-blockers was not evident in double-blind trials in patients with heart failure and concomitant AF28. Digoxin has traditionally been reserved for sicker patients or as a second-line agent. Similar to beta-blockers, there is no apparent mortality impact from digoxin in patients with AF and heart failure, and observational analyses are wholly inappropriate to evaluate outcomes with digoxin because of systematic prescription biases29,30. The RATE-AF trial was a head-to-head randomized trial of digoxin and beta-blockers, showing that digoxin had a similar impact on patient-report quality life as beta-blockers yet substantially improved functional class. Use of digoxin led to a significant reduction in natriuretic peptides, and fewer than half the number of primary care and unplanned hospital visits10. This study now adds a further dimension, showing that low-dose digoxin can be an effective rate control agent. The effect on heart rate and physical activity was consistent with the longer-term activity of digoxin, including pro-parasympathetic effects on cellular, electrophysiological and neurohormonal pathways8.Although the number of patients was limited and did not encompass all participants in RATE-AF, this study included a large volume of wearable data and was able to benefit from being embedded in a randomized trial to limit extraneous bias. The wearables were implemented post randomization and hence there is a risk of residual confounding; however, there was no crossover use of digoxin10, analysis was by intention-to-treat and reasonable balance in clinical characteristics between groups was maintained for those patients joining the wearable study. As expected, actual usage of wearable devices among participants had considerable variation. There is a known motivational and behavioral impact from wearables, although when asked at final follow-up, the same proportion in each randomized group indicated improved motivation for physical activity: 16 patients (59.3%) in the digoxin group and 13 (54.2%) in the beta-blocker group (P for comparison\\u2009=\\u20090.71). Use in an older population brought challenges, with many participants not previously owning a smartphone; however, good compliance and data quality were achieved. Missing data points were frequent, but their impact was minimized by using an innovative approach to embed machine learning on the significance of missing data, rather than ignore or impute it. Although subgroup analysis according to activity levels found no difference in heart rate between digoxin and beta-blockers, the use of digoxin in high-activity settings remains largely untested. Diversity in ethnicity was limited (white British or Irish ethnicity accounted for 94% of participants), and so these results cannot be extrapolated to other ethnicity groups. Although technology advances can improve human health, it remains important to ensure that deployment of such devices does not exacerbate health inequalities.In summary, a wrist-worn consumer-grade wearable device and smartphone were successfully deployed within a randomized controlled trial of older, multimorbid patients to evaluate continuous, ambulatory heart rate and physical activity. Including an average of two to three million data points per patient, including at rest and exertion, digoxin and beta-blocker therapy had similar effects on heart rate measured over a 20-week period. A neural network model of wearable sensor data showed similar performance for predicting future health status as conventional measures used in clinical trials.MethodsThe RATE-AF trialThe RATE-AF trial was a prospective, randomized, open-label, blinded end-point trial that compared the use of low-dose digoxin versus beta-blockers for long-term heart rate control7. Recruitment took place across primary care sites and three hospitals in the West Midlands region of England between 2016 and 2018. Inclusion criteria were: (1) age 60\\u2009years or older; (2) permanent AF in need of rate control; and (3) symptoms of heart failure, with breathlessness equivalent to NYHA class II or above. Exclusion criteria were limited so that the trial population reflected routine clinical practice (see published protocol for full list of selection criteria)10.Ethics and inclusion statementThe trial was co-designed by a patient and public involvement (PPI) team, with the aim of improving quality of life for patients with AF11,27. Ethical approval was obtained from the East Midlands\\u2013Derby Research Ethics Committee (16/EM/0178), the Health Research Authority (IRAS 191437) and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The trial was publicly funded by the UK National Institute for Health and Care Research (CDF-2015-08-074) and registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02391337) and clinicaltrialsregister.eu (2015-005043-13).Randomization and trial processEach participant was randomized to either digoxin 62.5\\u2013250\\u2009\\u00b5g or bisoprolol 1.25\\u201310\\u2009mg once daily in a 1:1 ratio at their baseline visit. Randomization was completed using a computer-generated minimization algorithm to ensure treatment arms were balanced for gender and AF symptoms, based on the mEHRA classification.The trial was embedded into usual care within the National Health Service (NHS), with participants attending formal visits at baseline, 6\\u2009months and 12\\u2009months. Endpoints acquired were patient-reported quality of life, NT-proBNP, symptoms and functional capacity using mEHRA and NYHA class, 6MW distance and time, heart rate (pulse examination), 12-lead ECG, LVEF using cardiac ultrasound and assessment of adverse events.Wearables substudyFunding for the wearables substudy was obtained after the main trial had commenced from the European Union Innovative Medicines Initiative BigData@Heart program (grant no. 116074). The study was supported by the Application of Artificial Intelligence to Routine Healthcare Data to Benefit Patients with Cardiovascular Disease (cardAIc) team at the University of Birmingham and University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Foundation Trust. An amendment was made to the trial protocol and subsequently approved by the Research Ethics Committee. One of the original stated aims of the substudy was to correlate wearable sensor data with patient quality of life using the Short Form (36) Health Survey (SF-36). Following work led by the PPI team that showed SF-36 to be as suboptimal measure of assessment27, this was subsequently changed to NYHA class in the statistical analysis plan completed before data analysis (Supplementary Note).Participants with at least 2\\u2009months remaining in the RATE-AF trial were considered eligible for inclusion in the substudy. All participants were provided with a specific patient information leaflet written by the PPI team, and were asked to sign an optional form to indicate informed consent. As an exploratory analysis, no sample size calculation was performed in advance of recruitment. Heart rate sensor data from the first 5\\u2009weeks in the first ten participants was used to estimate the minimum number of participants needed. The average weekly heart rate, s.d. and correlation of repeated measures from this data indicated that a sample size of 40 participants would provide 90% power over 20\\u2009weeks to detect a 1/3\\u2009s.d. difference in heart rate (2\\u2009bpm) between digoxin and beta-blockers (control 72\\u2009bpm; s.d. 6\\u2009bpm; repeated measures correlation 0.91; two-sided alpha 0.05). A minimum target of 50 enrolled participants would account for death and loss to follow-up during the substudy.Consenting individuals were given a Samsung A6 Android smartphone (with a prepaid mobile data contract) and wrist-worn Fitbit Charge 2 wearable device for passive monitoring. There were no exclusions related to age or previous proficiency with information technology. Applications were preinstalled and set up for remote data collection, providing active monitoring and an educational resource for patients, including the European Society of Cardiology smartphone application (app) specifically designed for patients with AF31. Participants were shown how to charge and carry out basic functions on each device, and how to use the apps. They were instructed to carry the phone throughout the day and to wear the wrist device continuously, only removing it for showering, bathing, swimming or charging. After the set-up appointment, in-person or telephone follow-up was provided after the first week, after 4\\u2009weeks and ad hoc to maintain engagement and address any concerns or technical issues raised by participants.Data collection and storageData collected via the device and smartphone was encrypted and uploaded to a secure server, temporarily cached on the smartphone until an appropriate Wi-Fi or mobile data connection was available. The collection of wearable data streams was automated using the RADAR-base platform, funded by the European Union Innovative Medicines Initiative RADAR-CNS (grant no. 115902)32. This platform allows for secure streaming of data from wearables, apps and devices to a central location. For this study, the RADAR-base platform was installed on a virtual machine hosted by Amazon Web Services in the Europe (London) region and was maintained by the Hyve (IT company, Netherlands). By applying for Fitbit developer application, the RADAR-base platform automatically collected data from registered participants, who were also able to see their own heart rate and step counts. For clinical data storage, secure electronic case report forms were generated using the Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) system hosted by the University of Birmingham, and the main trial case report forms hosted by the Birmingham Clinical Trials Unit.Statistical analysisData were analyzed by intention-to-treat according to the randomized allocation (digoxin versus beta-blockers), with no imputation for any missing data. Continuous measurements of heart rate and step count were pooled at 1-min intervals to form time-series data (heart rate averaged over each minute; step counts summed over each minute), with the primary analysis over a prespecified period of the first 20\\u2009weeks of device use. The results were summarized and presented as a number, percentage, mean and s.d. or standard error of the mean, or median with i.q.r. The Kruskal\\u2013Wallis nonparametric test or a t-test were used to determine differences between the two treatment arms depending on normality, and Spearman\\u2019s test was used to quantify correlations. To account for multiple repeated measurements of heart rate over time in individual participants, generalized linear models were generated using a random-effects estimator and exchangeable correlation matrix. A post-hoc subgroup analysis according to activity levels was based on US Centers for Disease Control recommended activity levels (minimum 150\\u2009min per week aerobic activity equivalent to 15,000 steps per week, and health benefits goal of 300\\u2009min per week aerobic activity equivalent to 30,000\\u2009steps per week). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata v.17 (StataCorp LP), with a two-tailed P-value <0.05 denoting statistical significance.Neural networkMachine learning algorithms were generated to explore whether continuous sensor data were comparable with conventional periodic trial measurements at the closest RATE-AF trial appointment, developed according to our previously published AI framework6. Unlabeled wearable sensor data from staggered 4-h periods were used to develop a self-supervising CNN (Extended Data Fig. 2). The self-supervising model was motivated by the principle that important information is carried not only in the heart rate and step count channels, but also in the temporal interaction between those channels. To learn this interaction, an auxiliary dataset was synthesized from a training set of the original sensor data where the heart rates and step counts of each sample were scrambled across patients and dissociated. For example, a multichannel sample might include the heart rate time-series of patient A, but the step count time-series of patient B. The auxiliary dataset was combined with the original data to create a classification problem: to discriminate whether a given sample came from the original or scrambled data. Because the original data have temporal interdependencies between the channels, and the scrambled data do not, it is believed that learning this objective is equivalent to learning the relationship between those sensor channels.Heart rate measures were standardized to z-scores; step counts were normalized to the range [0,1] because of frequent and meaningful measurements of zero (inactivity). Both were defined with respect to each participant\\u2019s individual statistics\\u2014a heart rate z-score of 0 indicates the mean average heart rate for that patient. Small amounts of missing data were present throughout the recordings: these may have been short periods in which participants were not wearing their devices, or where data was not received because of connectivity issues. This missing data was neither dropped nor imputed, but used as a third time-series channel alongside heart rate and step count. This allowed the model to learn the significance of missing data instead of making assumptions about its distribution.Multichannel time-series data were the input for a one-dimensional convolutional layer of 8 filters and a kernel size of 21 (minutes), followed by a one-dimensional max pooling layer of size and stride 2. After pooling are two further convolutional layers with 20 and 32 filters, each with kernel size 21. Finally, one-dimensional global average pooling was performed to reduce the data representation to a vector of length 32. During training, dropout (with probability\\u2009=\\u20090.5) was applied to this layer to improve regularization. Finally, the prediction is made by a fully connected layer comprising a single sigmoid unit. Every layer but the last used rectified linear unit activation, and the network was trained to minimize binary cross-entropy using an Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 3\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910\\u22124 and L2 regularization with weight 1\\u2009\\u00d7\\u200910\\u22128 applied to each nonbias parameter. After training the network to convergence, the dropout and classification layers were removed from the model, and the output of the final convolutional layer was used as a 32-dimensional embedding vector representing the time-series data used as input.Because the objective of this model was to predict the patient\\u2019s future NYHA class, it was evaluated by embedding data from each patient\\u2019s first week, and using that embedding to predict their NYHA class at the end of trial as the outcome of interest. This self-supervised model was trained using all data for each patient other than in this first week, while also holding out a subset of patients as a validation set to monitor under- or overfitting during model training. The hold-out set comprised 20% of the patient group, repeated across five iterations with k-fold cross-validation. For this exploratory analysis, participants were only included if they had available nonmissing time windows in the first and subsequent 19\\u2009weeks, and reached the final follow-up assessment for NYHA class. Models were compared for prediction of NYHA class at the end of the trial (5\\u2009months later): a conventional logistic regression model including ECG heart rate and 6MW test results (distance traveled, time taken and participant speed), and the wearable sensor model using CNN latent time-series embeddings from wearable sensor data as input features with L2 norm regularization (as used in ridge regression).We prespecified evaluation of models using the F1 score\\u2014a metric combining precision and recall that ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect accuracy for classification. For each model, label smoothing was used over the NYHA class targets as a further method of regularization. The 95% CI was estimated by bootstrap resampling. During the peer review process, a post-hoc analysis was added to calculate the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for each model, which provides an aggregate measure of classification performance with values ranging from 0 to 1 (higher indicates better performance). Machine learning analyses were performed using Python (Python Software Foundation) with scikit-learn, and TensorFlow (Google Brain).Role of the funding sourcesNone of the organizations providing funding had any role in the design or conduct of the study (including collection, analysis and interpretation of the data) or any involvement in preparation, review or approval of the manuscript.Reporting frameworksThe study is reported according to the Minimum Information about Clinical Artificial Intelligence Modeling (MI-CLAIM) checklist33.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\\n\\n\\nData availability\\nSummary anonymized wearable sensor data are available for noncommercial purposes on request to the corresponding author (d.kotecha@bham.ac.uk; 60\\u2009days response time for decisions).

S1 denotes start of sensor data collection. S2 denotes sensor data used for validation. Time-point 2 (t2) is the future for New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class prediction. Lower panel: The convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture uses dilated convolution and max-pool layers to capture long-term structure. Global average pooling is used to reduce spatial extent to fixed-length vector representation. Dropout and L2 penalty are applied to avoid overfitting to training set and label smoothing is used for faster learning. The final layer is binary sigmoid for data discrimination task. The penultimate layer of 32 units is used as latent space features for regression modeling.Extended Data Table 1 Baseline characteristics of patients that declined participationFull size tableExtended Data Table 2 Usage of devices at interim reviewFull size tableExtended Data Table 3 Wearable sensor parameters over sequential weeksFull size tableExtended Data Table 4 Change in NYHA classificationFull size tableSupplementary informationSupplementary InformationStatistical and AI analysis plan addendum.Reporting SummaryRights and permissions\\nOpen Access  This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License, which permits use, sharing, adaptation, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if changes were made.

It ties with\\u00a0LifeFone for the most connection types on this list (landline, AT&T, and Verizon cellular), its on-the-go devices have a high five-day battery life, and the brand has an overall fast response time of 1 to 25 seconds based on our testing. This may be why a majority (43%) of our survey respondents use Medical Guardian for their medical alert system. The second most popular system is Bay Alarm Medical (26%).\\nPros & Cons \\n\\nPros\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo long-term contracts or cancellation fees\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRange of up to 1,400 feet with the Home 2.0 system\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrequent deals and discounts\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFree month of service, free lockbox, and free shipping with annual subscription\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll devices are water-resistant\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMonthly fees start at about $30 (not including fall detection)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$149.95\\u2013$199.95 equipment fees with most systems\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Details Each Medical Guardian device had easy step-by-step setup instructions that involved us charging the device and placing a test call. We were able to complete the process with no issues. When we tested the Medical Guardian fall detection option, it successfully detected simulated falls from a standing position.\\n\\nAutomatic fall detection isn\\u2019t automatically included in the monitoring plans, but you can add it for $10 per month. Almost all Medical Guardian devices have optional fall detection\\u2014including the MGMove smartwatch, which was recently updated to include optional built-in fall detection.\\nThe MGMini Lite is also a good option for a discreet fall detection device you can wear on your wrist.

It was founded in 1946 and has reputable products and high customer reviews. Among the medical alert systems with fall alert devices we tested, Bay Alarm\\u00a0has the highest\\u00a0BBB rating (4.24 out of 5 stars) with 141 reviews.\\nBut it\\u2019s the long battery life in the company\\u2019s fall detection necklace that makes Bay Alarm Medical stand out. The company states the batteries in wall buttons and necklaces should last five years, and the battery in the at-home fall detector device lasts up to two years.\\nAutomatic fall detection costs $10 per month in addition to standard monitoring fees, plus a one-time $30 fall detection device cost.\\nPros & Cons \\n\\nPros\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBudget-friendly packages combine in-home and on-the-go protection for $40 per month\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo up-front costs, long-term contracts, or cancellation fees\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLifetime rate never goes up as long as you maintain your service\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbility to set up personal emergency contact list\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFree monitoring for roommate or partner (with purchase of a second device)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll devices are water-resistant or waterproof\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBase unit range of 1,000 feet, slightly less than Medical Guardian and LifeFone\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional charge for GPS button\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Details \\n\\nIn addition to the long battery life, Bay Alarm Medical also monitors and automatically replaces your batteries when they do get low.\\nWe had no issues setting up our Bay Alarm Medical devices during testing.

You can even get automatic fall detection with the on-the-go\\u00a0GPS medical alert system\\u00a0button.\\nPros & Cons \\n\\nPros\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFall detection available with every device as an add-on\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo activation fees, long-term contract, or cancellation fees\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLandline and cellular plan options\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Medical Alert Connect app lets you monitor your device, store health data, and connect with the help center\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSimple one-step setup\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll devices are waterproof\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBase unit range of only 800 feet\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMust wear two devices if you want fall detection\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n$99 one-time programming fee\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Details Medical Alert service starts at $27.95 per month for the Home Landline System, but if you pay for an annual subscription ($239.40), the cost drops to $19.95 per month. The Home Cellular System starts at $37.95 per month, or $29.95 when paid annually ($359.40). And the Mobile System starts at $47.95 per month, or $39.95 per month when paid annually ($479.40). Fall detection can be added to all three Medical Alert systems for an additional $10 per month ($120 annually).\\nThe downside: Fall detection cannot be built into the on-the-go mobile system device; instead the fall detection comes in a separate necklace. This means you\\u2019ll have to carry both the medical alert button and the smaller fall detection necklace. The at-home systems use a stationary base unit paired with a fall detection necklace, while the mobile system acts as an on-the-go base unit that is paired with the fall detection necklace.\\nThe mobile medical alert button can stay in your pocket or purse, while you should wear the fall detection necklace around your neck for accuracy. Although using two devices is not ideal, it may be worth it in exchange for the low monitoring fees.\\n\\nAt first, we couldn\\u2019t correctly pair the fall detection necklace with the at-home system because the user guide instructions were out of order. Besides this issue, the rest of the setup process was straightforward. We found the average response time for Medical Alert was 15\\u201325 seconds.\\nCustomer service and payment options\\nOur experience with Medical Alert customer service varied. The representative who helped us purchase our medical alert system was friendly and helpful. They even gave us their direct extension if we had any other questions. A different customer service representative called us to clarify something with our account, but we were busy and unable to take the call. We told the representative this and asked if they could call us back later, but they immediately hung up on us.\\nCommunication methods:\\u00a0Phone or email\\nPhone:\\u00a0Call 800-800-2537 every day from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET\\nEmail:\\u00a0customerrelations@medicalalert.com\\nPayment options:\\u00a0Credit card or debit card\\nRead our full Medical Alert brand review for more information.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMost Cost Savings\\n\\n\\n9.3 Excellent\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAverage response time: 45+ seconds\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStarting monthly fee: $39.99\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFall detection cost: $11 per month\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9.3 Excellent\\n\\n\\nSee Special Offers\\n1-866-492-0906 \\n\\n\\n\\nWhy We Chose ADT has a starting fee of $39.99 per month for its Medical Alert Plus system, and $41.99 per month for the On-the-Go system. Fall detection can be added to either system for an additional $11 per month. We like that ADT does not charge activation, processing, or equipment fees.\\nPros & Cons \\n\\nPros\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo activation or equipment fees\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo long-term contracts or cancellation fees\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMonthly, quarterly, and annual payment plans\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWaterproof wearable help buttons\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLandline and cellular options\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n30-day trial period\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNot all plans have the option to add fall detection\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDevice range of 100\\u2013600 feet, lower than most other medical alert system companies\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Details ADT offers two medical alert systems with fall detection: Medical Alert Plus and On-the-Go.\\nMedical Alert Plus starts at $39.99 per month. You can save $60 by choosing an annual plan ($419.88 per year versus $479.88 per year). The On-the-Go system starts at $41.99 per month, or $443.88 when paid annually. Fall detection can be added to either system for an additional $11 per month. The least expensive system ADT offers, Medical Alert Basic ($31.99 per month), does not include an option for fall detection.\\nSetting up our ADT medical alert systems was fairly simple. After plugging in our at-home base station and charging the mobile system, we called ADT to confirm our account, test our connection to the monitoring center, and verify fall detection was activated.\\nThe fall detection battery lasts 18 hours. Though this device isn\\u2019t guaranteed to detect all falls, when we tested ADT fall detection by dropping it from both a sitting and standing position, within 10 seconds the device gave a voice prompt: \\u201cFall detected. Press and hold button to cancel.\\u201d\\n\\nTo learn more, check out our\\u00a0ADT medical alert review. If you\\u2019re concerned about how to pay for your device, we have more information on medical alert systems cost.\\nCustomer service and payment options\\nWe used the online chat and phone options when speaking with ADT customer service representatives. The customer service phone number was very accessible: it was in large print on a sticker on the at-home base station. When we had a connection issue with one of our systems, we called customer service, and the representative figured out our issue quickly and efficiently.\\nCommunication methods:\\u00a0Phone or chat\\nPhone:\\u00a0800-238-2727 (sales and customer support)\\nChat:\\u00a0Website chat support is available Monday through Thursday from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. ET, Fridays from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET, and Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. ET\\nPayment options:\\u00a0Credit card\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBest Extra Features\\n\\n\\n9.7 Exceptional\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAverage response time: 1\\u201325 second\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStarting monthly fee: $29.95\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFall detection: $5 per month for most systems\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n9.7 Exceptional\\n\\n\\nSee Special Offers\\n1-866-201-6549 \\n\\n\\n\\nWhy We Chose The\\u00a0LifeFone\\u00a0medical alert system includes many features for those who are comfortable with technology. You can think of LifeFone as both a medical alert system with fall detection and an all-in-one home monitoring system. It includes several extra features not available from other companies on this list.\\nPros & Cons \\n\\nPros\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMultiple devices, including an on-the-go GPS button\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFrequent discounts and perks, such as a free lockbox with service\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLandline or cellular plans available\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNo activation fees, long-term contract, or cancellation fees\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll devices are water-resistant\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFall detection is a separate necklace\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n No detailed information about call center staffing or certification\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditional Details LifeFone works as an all-in-one home monitoring system, with the following features included in all of its devices:\\n\\nFire, smoke, and carbon monoxide sensor\\nMedication reminder (reminders are added through the app)\\nPersonal lockbox\\nActivity tracking system\\n\\nThere are also additional features that come with extra costs. Caregivers or users can schedule a daily test ($6 per month) for the system that can be turned off with the push of a button. If the button isn\\u2019t pressed, the call center will contact you.\\nYou can also schedule a daily check-in call ($19 per month), and a call center operator will call your phone just to make sure everything\\u2019s okay. In addition, there\\u2019s a caregiver app (free) to help you stay connected with loved ones. These types of extra features are valuable to medical alert system users. According to our survey, 40% of respondents said the biggest challenge with their medical alert system is that it doesn\\u2019t have enough special features.\\nLifeFone medical alert systems have a two-step setup process: Plug in (at-home base station) or charge the device (mobile systems and smartwatch), then contact the monitoring center and tell them you\\u2019re testing the device. We liked this straightforward setup.\\nThe company\\u2019s devices have a long battery life, a range of 1,300 feet, and low-cost automatic fall detection. Monthly monitoring starts at $25 per month, and fall detection is $5 per month, about half of what other companies charge. We found the average response time for LifeFone was 1\\u201325 seconds.\\n\\nCustomer service and payment options\\nThe LifeFone customer service phone number was listed throughout our user guide and activation instructions, so we never had to search for the number when we had questions while setting up our medical alert systems. The representatives were knowledgeable and able to answer our questions during our calls. Only one instance involved multiple calls to resolve an issue\\u2014we didn\\u2019t receive an email code right away to set up the caregiver app.\\nCommunication methods:\\u00a0Phone or email\\nPhone:\\u00a0Call 800-331-9198 Monday through Friday from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. ET and Saturday through Sunday from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET\\nEmail:\\u00a0info@lifefone.com\\nPayment options:\\u00a0Credit card, debit card, or online bill pay\\nRead our full LifeFone medical alert review for more information.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBest Smartwatch\\n\\n\\n8.8 Very Good\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAverage response time: 45+ seconds\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStarting monthly fee: $79.95\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\u2022\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFall detection cost: Included\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n8.8 Very Good\\n\\n\\nSee Special Offers\\n888-343-1513 \\n\\n\\n\\nWhy We Chose The\\u00a0UnaliWear Kanega Watch is one of the only medical alert systems with fall detection designed for your wrist.

See the section, \\u201cHow does fall detection work?\\u201d to learn more about necklace vs. wrist-based fall detection.\\n\\nFall detection is automatically included with the Kanega Watch and not charged as an extra monthly fee. The water-resistant watch is available in three colors and connects to a 24/7 monitoring center via Wi-Fi and Verizon cellular service.\\nThis dual connection keeps your watch connected to the monitoring center at all times, so if you have poor reception or lose connectivity, your watch will still be able to connect with the monitoring center.\\nSetting up our Kanega Watch did involve a lengthy call with customer service\\u2014it was not a \\u201cplug-and-play\\u201d process. Some users may like this step-by-step setup guided by a customer service representative, while others may rather do everything themselves through an online portal. During testing, we found that the average response time for the Kanega Watch was 45 seconds or more.\\nWhen testing the Kanega Watch during our medical alert system testing summit, we liked how simple it was to insert and remove the batteries. There are no screws or small latches to open since the rechargeable batteries attach to the watchband, which may be helpful if you experience arthritis, dexterity issues, or reduced vision.\\nThe Kanega includes four rechargeable batteries so you can swap the low batteries with fully charged ones without taking off your watch to charge it.\\nThe $79.95 starting monthly price is nearly $40 more than other medical alert systems in this review. But if you pay annually ($779.40 yearly), you can save 20% on the usual monthly subscription fee with no contract and the ability to cancel anytime. There is also a one-time $299 equipment fee, which includes the watch, batteries, charger, and initial setup and activation.\\nCustomer service and payment options\\nSince the Kanega Smartwatch doesn\\u2019t have an app or online portal, UnaliWear encourages users to contact the company over the phone for any maintenance issues or changes that need to be made to their accounts. We asked a few quick questions using the online chat, but most of our interactions were over the phone.\\nCommunication methods:\\u00a0Phone, email, or chat\\nPhone:\\u00a0Call 888-343-1513 Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 7 p.m. and 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. CT.

Sensors. March 2023. Found on the internet at https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/23/8/3983\\nExperts generally agree the best way to wear a fall detection device is as a necklace high on your chest and on top of your sternum for accuracy.\\nFall detection technology typically includes an accelerometer and other advanced sensors such as barometers to sense slight changes in speed, angle of descent, and air pressure to detect a fall, according to this 2021 systematic review. [4]Warrington, et al. Are Wearable Devices Effective for Preventing and Detecting Falls: an Umbrella Review. Found on the internet at https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-021-12169-7 The devices take the data from those sensors and plug the information into an algorithm to determine whether a fall actually occurred. If the device confirms a fall did occur, it contacts the company\\u2019s monitoring center to reach out to the medical alert user and notify contacts or send medical help if needed.\\nTo learn more about ambient sensors and monitoring centers, read about how medical alert systems work.\\nTypes of fall alert systems\\nFall alert systems come in two main categories: wearable sensors and ambient sensors. Fall detection wearable devices like pendant necklaces, watches, and wristband devices, and clip-on medical alerts use accelerometers to detect rapid downward movements that can indicate a fall. They often also include manual alert buttons. Because fall detection is not 100% accurate, our team recommends pressing the alert button when able to make sure the alert has gone through to the monitoring center.\\nAmbient home sensors use video cameras to monitor the user\\u2019s movement and detect falls. If a fall is transmitted to a monitoring center, a representative typically will call the user to check on them before notifying contacts or calling for emergency services, but this can depend on the user\\u2019s preferences and risk factors.\\nWearables are typically more cost-effective and versatile than ambient sensors. The accuracy of wearable fall detection devices does depend on type and placement, though. Fall detection is most accurate when worn high up on the body\\u2014around chest level or higher\\u2014and least accurate when worn low on the body, such as on the wrist, but technology for wrist devices is rapidly improving. Read more about the best medical alert watches and wrist-worn monitors.\\nIn addition to watches, medical bracelets are lightweight wearables that allow you to discreetly remain connected to your medical alert service at all times. The best medical alert bracelets have a range of 600-1400 feet from your base system. Pendants, or medical alert necklaces, are wearable buttons that resemble a charm on a necklace chain. Typically, these buttons have a range of 1,000-1,400 feet from your base system but there are also mobile options with unlimited range. Unfortunately, most medical alert bracelets and necklaces do not include fall detection. To learn more about these wearable devices, check out our comparison of the best medical alert necklaces.\\nHow accurate is fall detection?\\nBe aware that false positives can occur (when the device mistakenly detects a fall that hasn\\u2019t happened) if you drop your device or the device falls off a table.\\nThis 2020 research survey found an average accuracy rate of 93% for fall detection devices, but numbers vary.

Found on the internet at https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2020/2167160 This 2017 study found an average accuracy rate of 80%, and this 2018 review of 22 different studies Broadley, et al. Methods for the Real-World Evaluation of Fall Detection Technology: A Scoping Review. Found on the internet at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6068511found that, in order to arrive at a standard accuracy rate of fall detection systems, more real-world research is needed. Generally, researchers agree it\\u2019s not 100% accurate, but very close. [6]Aziz, et al. Validation of Accuracy of SVM-Based Fall Detection System Using Real-World Fall and Non-Fall Datasets.

Found on the internet at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6068511\\nIn the event of a false positive with your fall detection device, the company will reach out and verify whether you need assistance. Companies also encourage you to test your fall detection device monthly to ensure it\\u2019s still working. For step-by-step instructions on how to test a fall detection device (also known as a \\u201cdrop test\\u201d), see this guidance from Medical Guardian.\\nCost of medical alert systems with fall detection\\nThe cost of fall alert systems can vary widely, with monthly fees for services ranging from $19.95 to $159.95, not including the additional cost for fall detection. Typically, the fall detection feature adds an extra charge of about $10 per month\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b\\u200b.\\nSome fall alert systems offer all-in-one solutions, with fall detection already built into the medical alert monitor, and may include extras like a month of free service or free shipping with an annual monitoring subscription. Keep in mind, though, that automatic fall detection is generally not included in standard monitoring plans and needs to be added to the plan\\u200b\\u200b by either asking your medical alert customer representative to add it or by adding it to your account settings.\\nIf you\\u2019re concerned about how to pay for your medical alert system, you can find more information in our guide to free medical alert systems.\\nIs fall detection covered by insurance?\\nMedical alert systems, including fall detection, are generally not covered by most insurance plans. Medicare Part A and Part B do not cover these costs, but Medicare Part C, also known as Medicare Advantage, might cover some of the expenses. The coverage can vary, so it\\u2019s a good idea to call your insurance provider to find out what is covered and what the requirements are for coverage. Coverage is more likely to be approved if an attending doctor has prescribed medical alert monitoring.\\nPrivate insurance plans may offer some options for coverage. Contact your plan provider to see if you\\u2019re covered for the cost of a medical alert system\\u200b.\\nLearn more about medical alert system coverage.\\nHow to save money on fall detection\\nFall detection is generally an additional monthly fee to a medical alert system. You can expect to pay an additional $11 per month. If you\\u2019re looking to save money on fall detection, start with an affordable medical alert system like MobileHelp or Medical Alert, which both begin at $19.95 per month. LifeFone isn\\u2019t much more, with a starting monthly rate of $24.95 and fall detection for just $5 more on most systems.\\nWhy is fall detection important?\\nIn our survey, automatic fall detection was the most popular special feature our respondents wanted in a medical alert system. Fall alert systems can prevent negative consequences like dehydration, hypothermia, and pressure sores if someone falls and is lying on the ground for a long time.\\nAll medical alert systems have a button to press in the event of a fall or other emergency. But if you\\u2019re not close to the button when you fall, you may not be able to get to it. That\\u2019s why fall detection is so important.\\n\\u201cImpairments in vision, hearing, and balance can make an older person more vulnerable to falls than others,\\u201d said Liron Sinvani, MD, director of the hospitalist service at Northwell Health and associate professor of medicine at Zucker School of Medicine at Hofstra/Northwell in the New York City area. \\u201cThose who have conditions such as osteoarthritis or dizziness, or take multiple medications, also have a greater risk of falling.\\u201d\\nTo gauge your risk of falling and get tips on how to prevent falls, use NCOA\\u2019s Falls Free CheckUp. And for guidance on how caregivers can discuss falls prevention, use NCOA\\u2019s Falls Prevention Conversation Guide for Caregivers.\\nWhat to consider when choosing a fall detection device\\nBelow are some of the most important considerations to account for when deciding which fall alert system is best for your or your care recipient\\u2019s needs.\\nAccuracy and reliability\\nThe device\\u2019s ability to accurately detect real falls while minimizing false alerts is a central concern. Look for monitoring devices that use multiple sensors and have published clinical studies validating their accuracy across diverse fall scenarios, such as from a chair as compared to a standing position. Devices that combine accelerometers with other sensors, like gyrometers, tend to offer higher fall detection accuracy.\\nDetection speed\\nFaster detection of a fall event and emergency transmission to contacts or first responders allows for earlier intervention. Prioritize devices that have the best record of quickly connecting with a monitoring center\\u2014ideally within 30 seconds or less.\\nRange and GPS capabilities\\nConsider both indoor and outdoor use cases. Devices that rely on stationary home bases have limited range, while wearables with GPS allow location tracking and emergency detection on-the-go. Evaluate the user\\u2019s activity levels and falls risks when deciding on range needs.\\nErgonomics and wearability\\nThe device should be lightweight, comfortable, and easy to operate by the user. Aesthetically subtle and fashionable devices like wristband devices and jewelry snap-ons for pendant necklaces are more user-friendly since they blend in with the user\\u2019s everyday wear.\\nWaterproof medical alert devices are also more practical and offer greater protection in high-risk areas like kitchens and bathrooms. A long battery life that minimizes the time needed to take the monitor off to recharge, and reminder alerts that help users in their day-to-day activities, like medication and appointment reminders, also can help boost compliance.\\nUser interface and displays\\nIntuitive, user-friendly interfaces are especially important for the cognitively impaired. Look for clear, simple displays with customizable text size options. Audible guidance and alerts should also be available.\\nTalking to your loved one about fall detection devices\\nDiscussing the need for a fall alert system with a loved one can be difficult, so we suggest having a thorough understanding of how these devices work before approaching the subject. When you\\u2019re ready to discuss fall detection, it\\u2019s important to note the purpose of these devices is to promote safety and independence. Using a fall detection device can empower your care recipient to continue enjoying activities without worrying about getting help if they fall. \\nDiscussing medical alert systems and fall detection can be a positive conversation when approaching it from a well-informed, thoughtful perspective.\\u00a0\\nBest medical alert systems with fall detection: Bottom line\\nCombined with a medical alert system, fall detection can provide an important second layer of protection. You will have peace of mind knowing help is on the way even if you don\\u2019t push the help button.\\nIf you\\u2019re looking for the best fall detection devices, we recommend Medical Guardian for its long device range, MobileHelp if you\\u2019d like a simple device with no extra fees and a fast response time, and Bay Alarm Medical for the best devices and longest battery life.\\nConsider ADT Health and LifeFone for the best extra features. We recommend Medical Alert for the lowest price, and the UnaliWear Kanega Watch if you\\u2019re interested in a smartwatch with fall detection.\\nWe do not recommend Life Alert because it doesn\\u2019t offer fall detection and has other major drawbacks, like a three-year contract, high fees, and pushy sales tactics.\\nGoing with any of these companies can give you more confidence to go out on your own and do the things you enjoy. It also can assure your friends and loved ones that you have access to help when they can\\u2019t be there.\\n\\nFrequently asked questions\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHow much does a fall detection device cost?\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nFall detection devices are typically connected to a medical alert system. While some systems include device costs in their monthly fees, others charge their device fee upfront. Most devices with fall detection start at around $35 for a landline home system, with mobile devices costing up to $400 or more.\\nOn average, fall detection monitoring costs about $10 per month. Most companies charge an additional fee to add this feature. Some companies, like Lifeline and UnaliWear, include the cost of fall detection for its medical alert systems in the price.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAre medical alert systems with fall detection covered by Medicare?\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nMedical alert systems with fall detection may partially be covered with Medicare Advantage, also known as Part C, but Medicare Part A and Part B do not offer coverage. For more information, check out our article on if medical alert systems are covered by insurance. Reach out to your insurance provider to check your eligibility and coverage requirements.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat features are important in fall detection systems?\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nYou should make sure your device has \\u201cautomatic\\u201d fall detection. Otherwise, it\\u2019s the same as a standard help button you press when you have an emergency.\\nA waterproof fall detection device is a good idea, since falls frequently happen in the bath or shower. All devices on this list are either waterproof or water-resistant. Waterproof means the device is airtight and can withstand water no matter how long it\\u2019s submerged. Water-resistant means it can withstand water to a certain degree, but not entirely.\\nThe device should be comfortable, easy to wear, and suit your personal style. If your fall detection device is clunky or unattractive, you may not wear it regularly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDoes fall detection really work?\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nDifferent systems use different technology, and this can affect accuracy. The best fall detection devices use several tools that can tell the difference between a fall and a normal movement.\\nResearch has shown medical alert bracelets and watches aren\\u2019t as accurate at detecting falls as necklaces.

Although you can buy fall detection devices that fit in your pocket, the extra layer of fabric can prevent the device from sensing a fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWho should use fall detection medical alert systems?\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nFalls are the leading cause of serious injury among older adults, according to the CDC. [8]Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Older Adult Falls Data. Found on the internet at https://www.cdc.gov/falls/data/index.html It\\u2019s worth considering a fall detection system if you have a medical condition or live alone.\\nEven if you have a medical alert system at home, it may not provide protection if you\\u2019re unable to reach the base station or wall-mounted help button after a fall.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat are the best fall detection devices?\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nThe best medical alert systems with fall detection include Medical Guardian, MobileHelp, Bay Alarm Medical, Medical Alert, ADT Health, LifeFone, and the UnaliWear Kanega Watch. But the best for you will depend on your lifestyle, preferences, and budget.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDo smartphones have fall detection?\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nYes, some smartphones have fall detection built into the device. But most often, it\\u2019s connected to a smartwatch and found in a health app. You\\u2019ll need to activate the settings on your watch or phone to ensure fall detection is enabled.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhich medical alert systems come with fall detection?\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nAll devices from Medical Alert have the option to add fall detection. Fall detection is automatically included with the UnaliWear Kanega Watch. Not all devices have the option for Medical Guardian, Bay Alarm Medical, ADT Health, and LifeFone, but a majority do have the option to add fall detection.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWhat is the best wearable device for fall detection?\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nThe best wearable device for fall detection depends on your needs, preferences, and lifestyle. While our top pick is Medical Guardian for its fall detection technology, fast response time, and cost-effective options, it\\u2019s important to consider factors such as comfort, ease of use, on-the-go capabilities, and more. Different devices will suit different people.

Consumer wearable devices, which monitor heart rate and physical activity (PA) via a wristband connected smartphone, can provide clinically valuable data for comparing the efficacy of digoxin (Digox; Concordia Pharmaceuticals) versus beta-blockers in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and heart failure (HF), according to a study published in Nature Medicine. The findings support the potential of utilizing wearable technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to continuously monitor treatment responses, measure disease severity, and provide timely clinical information for patients with cardiovascular disease (CVD).The findings highlight the potential of consumer-wearable devices as an alternative, dynamic method for monitoring patients with heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Image Credit: \\u00a9 Jacob Lund - stock.adobe.comCVD is the leading cause of death in the US, accounting for approximately 928,741 deaths in 2020, and encompasses various other related conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels, such as HF and AF. HF occurs when the heart is not pumping well enough to meet the body\\u2019s needs for blood and oxygen, leading to the buildup of fluid in the lungs. This may lead to symptoms like shortness of breath, persistent coughing, or rapid or irregular heartbeat. HF has strong associations with AF, the most common type of heart arrythmia characterized by the heart beating too fast, slow, or irregularly. The conditions are considered bidirectional, meaning one can contribute to the development or worsening of the other.1-4Treatment for patients with HF and AF often includes medications to help improve the function of the heart, control blood pressure, or reduce cholesterol; however, surgery to repair the heart or implant a device to support the heart\\u2019s function may be recommended for patients with greater disease severity. Patients may struggle to adhere to their treatment plans due to the time-consuming clinical visits and the high costs associated with the treatment. Additionally, clinicians can receive limited functional data demonstrating a patient\\u2019s health status at individual appointments. Utilizing consumer-wearable devices gives providers the ability to continuously monitor patients\\u2019 health metrics, allowing them to provide more personalized treatment plans and respond more promptly to shifts in disease severity.3,5In the study, the researchers hypothesized that wearable devices can (1) identify whether digoxin is inferior to beta-blockers for long-term heart rate control in patients with AF at rest and on exertion, (2) improve ability to adjust for differences in PA, and (3) explore whether data collected from wearable devices are comparable with conventional methods for predicting treatment progress. They performed statistical analyses to compare heart rates between participants receiving digoxin and participants receiving beta-blockers based on reported results from the RATE-AF trial (NCT02391337). Using a convolutional neural network, they analyzed the wearable device data and predicted New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class.5,6The study involved 53 older, multimorbid patients (mean age 75.6\\u2009years [s.d. 8.4], 40% women) with permanent AF and HF who were randomized to receive either digoxin or beta-blockers. The researchers successfully collected over 140 million data points for heart rate and PA intervals and found there was no significant difference in heart rate between participants receiving digoxin compared with those treated with beta-blockers. Additionally, data collected from wearable devices were comparable to standard clinical measures of electrocardiographic heart rate and 6-minute walk test (F1 score 0.56 [95% CI 0.41 to 0.70] versus (0.55 [95% CI 0.41 to 0.68]) and can predict NYHA functional class.5The findings highlight the potential of consumer-wearable devices as an alternative, dynamic method for monitoring patients with HR and AF, potentially replacing or supplementing in-person clinical assessments and enhancing the timeliness and quality of care for patients.\\u201cHeart conditions such as [AF] and HF are expected to double in prevalence over the next few decades, leading to a large burden on patients as well as substantial healthcare cost,\\u201d said Professor Dipak Kotecha, MBChB, PCAP, MSc, FRCP, FESC, FHEA, professor of cardiology at the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences at the University of Birmingham, and lead study author, in a press release. \\u201cThis study is an exciting showcase for how artificial intelligence can support new ways to help treat patients better.\\u201d7REFERENCESPalliative care strategies can improve the management of cardiovascular disease.

Nearly one in five patients experience altered sleep patterns that make daytime functioning difficult. These sleep disturbances also increase the risk of developing anxiety and depression.\\nResearchers in the lab of Terri Armstrong, Ph.D., at the NCI Center for Cancer Research\\u2019s Neuro-Oncology Branch (NOB) are devising ways to monitor patients\\u2019 sleep over long time periods. They are leading an observational study using a smart wearable device called a Fitbit to measure sleep, heart rate, and activity patterns. They also combined these physiological measurements with participants\\u2019 self-assessments.\\nThe researchers recently demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of this approach in an interim analysis published in Neuro-Oncology Practice. They hope their work will help identify which brain tumor patients are vulnerable to developing sleep issues\\u2014and prompt more targeted interventions to address these problems.\\u00a0\\n\\u201cSleep disturbance is pervasive across the neuro-oncology population,\\u201d Dr. Armstrong says. \\u201cWe noticed this in the clinic many years ago, which spurred us to conduct extensive lab work examining the biological underpinnings of this phenomenon. With this clinical study, we\\u2019re taking what we learned at the lab bench and bringing it back to the bedside to help patients.\\u201d\\nBench to Bedside and Back Again\\nIn 2017, Dr. Armstrong\\u2019s lab devised the first mouse model replicating the daytime sleepiness that many brain tumor patients experience due to radiation treatment. Former NOB Postdoctoral Fellow Dorela Shuboni-Mulligan, Ph.D., led this preclinical work and was instrumental in initiating the new clinical study.\\u00a0\\n\\u201cWe found a simple, cost-effective way to collect high quality sleep data, and the participants really enjoyed it,\\u201d says Dr. Shuboni-Mulligan, now an assistant professor of pathology and anatomy at Eastern Virginia Medical School. \\u201cIt was also gratifying to see many of the same trends we\\u2019d observed in our preclinical models reflected in people.\\u201d\\nA cloud-based platform called Fitabase allowed the researchers to monitor the data collection in real time. Without providing any personally identifiable information, participants could control their accounts via a mobile app and authorize which data the researchers could see.\\nThe interim analysis examined the first 54 people enrolled in the study. Over the course of four weeks, participants wore their Fitbits for most of the day and night, only removing the watches to charge. They also completed a series of self-assessments (often called patient-reported outcomes). During the final week, they maintained a daily sleep diary.\\nThe researchers were very pleased with how closely most participants followed the study protocol. Seventy-two percent wore their Fitbits for the entire study duration, and 100 percent completed all the self-assessments.\\nMaeve Pascoe, M.D., a former NIH Medical Research Scholars Program Fellow, helped patients join the study. She would also reach out to them if they weren\\u2019t wearing and charging their watches.\\u00a0\\n\\u201cThe adherence to the study design was staggering,\\u201d says Dr. Pascoe, now a neurology resident at the University of Michigan. \\u201cDr. Armstrong\\u2019s group is very good at implementing outcomes measures and interacting with patients. As the study progressed, we had to remind fewer and fewer people to wear their watches. This bodes well for the feasibility of future studies\\u2014and shows just how motivated our patients are.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nClinical Trial to Reduce Stress and Improve Mood\\nA clinical trial uses virtual reality to improve the distress and anxiety that people with brain tumors experience.\\n\\n\\n\\nAn Unexpected Benefit\\nAlthough the study was purely observational\\u2014the researchers were not testing new treatments\\u2014the participants received a surprising benefit. More than 10 percent experienced fewer sleep disturbances at night and less sleep-related impairment during the day. The researchers suspect this was because people were engaging with their own sleep data and changing their behaviors as a result. For example, if your Fitbit indicates you have a sleep deficit from the night before, you may be more likely to go to bed early the next day.\\nThose who reported sleep disturbances at night also tended to have more fragmented sleep: After going to bed, they would wake up periodically. As Dr. Shuboni-Mulligan explains, these issues could signal that cancer treatment or other factors may be affecting patients\\u2019 circadian rhythms.\\u00a0\\nPeople may be more or less susceptible to sleep disturbances depending on whether they are \\u201cmorning larks\\u201d who are active early in the day or \\u201cnight owls\\u201d who spring to life at night. Thirty-nine percent of study participants identified as morning larks, while only 6 percent identified as night owls. The rest fell somewhere in between.\\nDr. Armstrong\\u2019s previous research showed that brain tumor patients who carry a genetic mutation associated with morning larks are often protected against the daytime sleepiness caused by radiation treatment. By contrast, in the general cancer population, night owls tend to have worse treatment outcomes. As a result, understanding when a person is most active during the day could signal if they will develop sleep disturbances during treatment. However, before making any predictions, researchers must account for other factors (such as age) that could affect whether someone is a morning or an evening person, Dr. Shuboni-Mulligan says.\\nUsing Tech Devices to Improve Outcomes\\nThe researchers, led by Clinical Staff Scientist Amanda King, Ph.D., are eager to see what else they will uncover as the study progresses and they work toward their goal of enrolling 160 participants. They are also continuing to address potential limitations. (For example, the Fitbit has trouble differentiating between naps and meditation.)\\nThe team is also spearheading additional efforts to address patient symptoms, including a clinical study using virtual reality to ease anxiety and depression, and a free app to track symptoms and self-care activities.\\n\\u201cWe are lucky to be working with such amazing patients,\\u201d Dr. Pascoe says. \\u201cThey really love contributing to science and are extremely driven to improve care and treatment for others with brain tumors.\\u201d\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead the\\u00a0interim analysis\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n< Older Post\\nModifying A Chemotherapy Drug Offers Hope to People with Rare Brain and Spine Tumors\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you would like to reproduce some or all of this content, see Reuse of NCI Information for guidance about copyright and permissions.

declining, Samsung lays out plans to boost sales\\n\\nMax Wang, Taipei; Jack Wu, DIGITIMES Asia\\n\\nWednesday 17 July 2024\\n\\n0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCredit: DIGITIMES\\n\\nDespite a decline in demand for devices like smartwatches in the first half of the year, Samsung remains hopeful that new products and marketing strategies will drive a turnaround in wearable device sales.Recently, Samsung unveiled its latest Galaxy Z Fold 6 and Flip 6 foldable smartphones, along with the Galaxy Watch Ultra, Galaxy Watch 7, and true wireless Bluetooth earphones Galaxy Buds3 Pro and Galaxy Buds3.Samsung noted that thanks to the strong sales of the Galaxy S24 series, the sales revenue of smartphones priced above US$600 grew by 15%, resulting in a 7-8% year-on-year increase in Samsung's smartphone sales revenue, outperforming the overall market.Regarding smartwatch sales, Samsung stated that from January to May 2024, the overall smartwatch sales volume decreased by 15% compared to the same period in 2023, with sales revenue also dropping by over 11%. However, Samsung's smartwatch sales volume and revenue grew by 2% and 7% year-on-year respectively. In addition, earphone products saw a nearly 30% year-on-year increase in sales revenue.Samsung believes that the high penetration rate of the wearable device market and the wide range of products from brand manufacturers make it relatively challenging to fully display these items in physical stores. This is why significant growth opportunities will be hard to come by in the future wearable device market.To boost sales, Samsung plans to introduce a more comprehensive product lineup to cater to different consumer groups. Additionally, the company will enhance efforts to bundle wearables with smartphone sales, using methods like add-on purchases to attract market attention. Moreover, Samsung will strengthen product experiences to boost consumers' purchase willingness.Samsung emphasized that consumer brand preference for Samsung grew by over 40% year-on-year in 2023. The proportion of new young users also increased from 13% to 43%. To align with trends, besides continuing to optimize products, marketing, and sales channels, Samsung will also seek cross-industry collaboration opportunities with sectors like music and gaming to boost its brand power.Furthermore, Samsung highlighted that its Galaxy AI ecosystem is more complete than its competitors. By continuing to empower its products with AI, Samsung aims to create a greater differentiation in brand value and product strength over its peers.\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated storiesSamsung's new smartwatches, smart rings bolster its AI ecosystemNew Samsung smartphones showcase foldables, GenAIPC designs growing more revolutionarySamsung takes dual-track approach with smartwatches and smartphones to expand Galaxy AI ecosystemHuawei ramping up Kirin chip output for smart wearablesShow moreCategoriesAI IT + CE IT components, peripherals Tagsbrand demand Galaxy revenue sales Samsung smartphone smartwatch wearable \\n\\nShare this article\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOther links\\n\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated topicGlobal supply chain: Emerging tech, businesses\\n\\n\\n\\nBIZ FOCUSJul 18, 10:42Generative AI ignites: Semiconductor industry shows new facetMonday 15 July 2024Crypto Quantique partners with silicon IP distributors across Asia to deliver quantum-driven chip securityMonday 15 July 2024How cryptocurrency technology can enhance financial servicesThursday 11 July 2024TechInsights: Americas' chip suppliers continue to dominate R&D spendingTOP STORIES7 DAYS NEWSChinese brands dominate smartphone and TV markets via dual circulation strategyTaiwan fab toolmakers grab major orders from TSMC and ChinaChina's counter-intuitive semiconductor exports surge goes unnoticedMediaTek to surpass Qualcomm Snapdragon in 5G smartphone marketAI server shipments to surge in 2H24 as GPU shortage easesTSMC sees 3nm chip output exceed 100,000 wafers monthlyASML performance surges amid TSMC investment rumors, strong China sales despite US curb threatsSingtel partners with SKT to accelerate 6G and AI transformationChinese PV companies flock to Middle East with new projectsDemand for gaming MCUs is picking upFull list\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoin our mailing list\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDIGITIMES\\n\\nAbout\\nAdvertising\\nMembership\\nTerms & conditions\\nPrivacy policy\\nCopyright policy\\nContact us\\nNotes & corrections\\nSite map\\n\\u4e2d\\u6587\\u7db2\\u7e41\\u9ad4\\n\\u4e2d\\u6587\\u7f51\\u7b80\\u4f53\\n\\n\\n\\nTOOLS & SERVICES\\n\\nTomorrow's Headlines\\n7 days news\\nWeb news elsewhere\\nTopics\\nRSS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a9\\u00a02024 DIGITIMES Inc.

High-tech footwear and a versatile vest comprise the recently introduced products. The footwear, which Nike describes as \\\"wearable and mobile,\\\" is equipped with heat and dynamic air-compression massage capabilities for the feet and ankles. A system of dual-air Normatec bladders, which are incorporated with warming elements, is employed in these boots to ensure that the upper portion of the boots is evenly heated. Nike clarified that this combination is intended to \\\"drive heat deep into the muscle and tissue in the foot and ankle, helping athletes move, perform and recover naturally much faster.\\\" The battery cell, which is situated in the insole of each shoe, regulates the three levels of compression and heat that the boots provide. Athletes can choose to control the heat and compression of both shoes simultaneously with a single button or adjust each shoe individually.\\nThe collaborative vest utilizes thermoelectric coolers to deliver immediate heating and cooling capabilities without requiring ice or liquid. According to Nike, this feature enables athletes to \\\"dial their body temperatures to their exact specifications during warm-ups and cool-downs.\\\" Hyperice, a company renowned for its innovative recuperation technology, contributes its expertise to this partnership, supplementing Nike's product line with state-of-the-art thermal and compression technology. This collaboration represents a substantial advancement in the development of recovery solutions and optimal athletic performance.\\nBecome a Subscriber\\nPlease purchase a subscription to continue reading this article.\\nSubscribe Now\\n\\nRead more\\n\\n\\n\\n\\njirehl  \\n \\nRELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Software & Data \\n\\nNVIDIA Launches Comprehensive Suite of Healthcare Microservices to Advance AI-Driven Medical Innovations \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n Biotech \\n\\nAurion Biotech Gains FDA Fast-Track Designations for Corneal Therapy \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n Consumer Internet \\n\\nDirect-to-Consumer Medical Tests Gain Traction \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Companies \\n\\nPfizer Struggles with Employee Morale Amid Business Turnaround \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n Companies \\n\\nDuPont to Acquire Donatelle Plastics, Enhancing Healthcare Capabilities \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n Features \\n\\nAI\\u2019s Role in Addressing Healthcare\\u2019s Data Challenges \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Features \\n\\nWarren Buffett Donates Record $5.3 Billion in Berkshire Hathaway Shares \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n Companies \\n\\nSimplify Healthcare and Capgemini Collaborate to Enhance Payer Efficiency \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n Features \\n\\nSmarter Data Regulation Needed to Prevent Misuse \\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Biotech \\n\\nJ.P.

Our Experts Explain\\n\\n                    Jul 12, 2024\\n                    Jeremy Deutchman\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSince ancient Greece, patient history and physical examination have been the cornerstone of medicine. Yet, this information is not always detailed in the electronic health record (EHR), nor does the EHR consistently offer more objective real-time data. These gaps can impair actionable intelligence when it comes to making treatment decisions.\\nWearable monitoring devices represent a revolution in information capture, transforming outcomes for orthopedic patients and others. Discoveries sat down with Joseph Schwab, MD, MS, the director of both Spine Oncology for Orthopaedic Surgery and the Center for Surgical Innovation and Engineering at Cedars-Sinai; and Hamid Ghaednia, PhD, co-director of the Center for Surgical Innovation and Engineering, to discuss the promise of wearable technology in improving patient care and quality of life.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat are wearable monitoring devices in the context of orthopedic care?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoseph Schwab, MD, MS: Most of us are already familiar with wearables, such as phones or watches, that track our motion. But those have limitations. We\\u2019re designing advanced technologies that use machine-learning algorithms to give us less subjective data we can incorporate into the EHR. We want to get a better picture of what may be happening with individual patients\\u2019 musculoskeletal and neuromuscular health.\\nHamid Ghaednia, PhD: The majority of wearables use motion tracking or accelerometers. The challenge with current motion-tracking systems is that they give us an indirect measurement of muscle activity. These systems make lots of general assumptions about human bodies, even though every body is different. Those assumptions get baked into the resulting data. Our center is focused on direct measurement of muscle movement\\u2014wearables that will give us quantitative insights about patients\\u2019 progress and changes in clinical conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWearables have tremendous potential to open up a whole new era in our understanding of muscle physiology.\\u201d\\n\\u2014 Dr. Joseph Schwab\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow would this data complement the other information physicians are trying to capture in the EHR?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJS: One thing lacking in clinical medicine right now is a real-time understanding of our neuromuscular system. Patient history and physical exam\\u2014along with data from MRI, ultrasound and muscle biopsy\\u2014are critical, but they\\u2019re static and don\\u2019t tell us much about what\\u2019s happening during real-time activity. Wearables have tremendous potential to open up a whole new era in our understanding of muscle physiology.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow can this intelligence benefit patients?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHG: Dr. Schwab started using artificial intelligence to predict mortality of the spinal column 15 years ago, when no one was implementing these kinds of decision-support systems. As a result, now we can predict mortality of spine oncology patients, which empowers us to make better and more objective decisions. Four years ago, we decided to take this to a new level by integrating machine learning with novel devices and wearables. When we focus on wearables as one critical component of a more systematic approach to patient care, we see remarkable leaps forward in our diagnostic and treatment abilities.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhy is Cedars-Sinai the ideal place for this work?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJS: Cedars-Sinai is a top-flight research institution that matches its world-class clinical reputation. Worldwide, there are very few centers developing wearables and biomedical devices within a hospital setting, which makes this place truly unique.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTags:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                          Innovation\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                          Orthopaedic Research\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                          Technology\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                          discoveries\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                          Featured\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    Blog & Magazines\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\ncatalyst\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       Blog & Magazines Home\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nCS-Blog\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       Blog\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nCS Magazine\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       Cedars-Sinai Magazine\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\ndiscoveries magazine\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       Discoveries Magazine\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\nEmbracing our Community\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       Embracing Our Community\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       Catalyst\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t                      \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n                       International\\n                \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    Blog & Magazines\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\ncatalyst\\n\\n          \\n          \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        Blog & Magazines Home  \\n \\nCS-Blog\\n\\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        Blog  \\n \\nEmbracing our Community\\n\\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        Embracing Our Community  \\n \\nCS Magazine\\nCedars-Sinai Magazine  \\n \\ndiscoveries magazine\\n\\n          \\n          \\n          \\n          \\n        \\n\\n        Discoveries Magazine  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    Popular Topics\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Patients\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                            Scientists\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                            Innovations\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Quick Reads\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n                            Weird Science\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    Make an Appointment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n            \\n                Find a Doctor\\n            \\n            \\n           \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n            \\n                Schedule a Callback\\n            \\n            \\n           \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    Call Us 7 Days a Week, 6 am - 9 pm PT\\n\\n\\n\\n1-800-CEDARS-1\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n  \\n    \\n  \\n  \\n \\n    \\n    Support Cedars-Sinai\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n            \\n                MAKE A GIFT\\n            \\n            \\n           \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n            \\n                VOLUNTEER\\n            \\n            \\n           \\n        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Why Wearables?

His writing has appeared in publications such as CNN.com, PC World, InfoWord, and many others.\\n\\n\\n\\nlifewire's editorial guidelines\\n\\n\\n\\nPublished on July 15, 2024\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn This Article\\nRelease Date Rumors\\nPre-Order Information\\nPrice Rumors\\nFeatures\\nLatest News\\n Apple may be working on a small wearable device that projects audio beams at the user's ears to let them hear audio without headphones. News of this device came in a patent filing granted to the company in May 2024. This article explains what the patent covers, what the product might be, and what we know about it.\\n\\n\\n  What Is the Apple Wearable Device With Direct Audio Release Date?  \\n There's not a lot to go on about this device, just the patent\\u2014and not all patents lead to products. In fact, Apple and other tech companies receive hundreds and thousands of patents every year, and not all of that technology makes it to market.\\n\\n\\n Given that there are no rumors of an actual product using this technology, it's too early to know a release date for this unnamed device (if it gets released at all).\\n\\n\\nLifewire's Release Date Estimate\\nWe don't expect to see this direct audio device until late 2025 or 2026 (or maybe even later).\\n  Pre-Order Information  \\n Given that there aren't even rumors of a product here, there's no pre-order information to share right now. We'll update this article if that changes.\\n\\n\\n  Apple Wearable Device With Direct Audio Price Rumors  \\n The rumor mill doesn't have anything to say about prices for an Apple wearable with direct audio. If and when such a product is released, we expect it would cost at least as much as AirPods Pro ($249). It wouldn't surprise us if the price tag were higher.\\n\\n\\n  Apple Wearable Device With Direct Audio Features  \\n Apple's patent for this wearable computing device (Patent #US 11979721 B2) describes a gadget that can be worn on clothes and contains a set of speakers and microphones. The speakers beam audio to the wearer's ears, while the microphones take voice commands (probably to Apple's digital assistant, Siri).\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Apple, Inc / USPTO\\n\\n It's not hard to imagine that this device could be a next-generation AirPods product. It also brings to mind wearable computers like the Humane AI pin. While that particular product hasn't succeeded, the concept of a wearable device with a next-generation interface could likely crop up more in the coming years.\\n\\n\\n While we don't know much about this potential product yet, the patent describes two key features:\\n\\n\\n Directional audioMicrophones for commands, user identification, and calibration.\\n\\n\\n  Directional Audio  \\n The patent discusses an array of parametric speakers that send sound beams to the wearer's ears (this is called directional audio).\\n\\n\\n By making these beams of sound small and focused, the user can hear audio from the device without other people nearby\\u2014even people within a foot or two of the wearer\\u2014picking it up. That means the user doesn't need to wear earbuds or headphones to listen to music or make phone calls.\\n\\n\\n Directional audio using parametric speakers may sound futuristic, but it already exists in a few products.\\n\\n\\n  Microphones for Commands, User Identification, and Callibration  \\n The patented device would also contain microphones. These could be used for commands with a virtual assistant like Apple Intelligence or Siri.\\n\\n\\n The patent also mentions user identification\\u2014presumably the device would get to know your voice and maybe even use it as a password (the HomePod does something similar with Personal Requests)\\u2014and calibration (likely to gauge background noise and vocal volume to attune the device to the user and its surroundings).\\n\\n\\n  The Latest News About the Apple Wearable Device With Direct Audio  \\n Lifewire delivers all the latest news and opinions about ear buds and other wearable devices.

The high-end smartwatch costs twice as much as Samsung\\u2019s latest standard model, the Galaxy Watch 7, which will sell for $300.Tethering AI to people\\u2019s essential devices has become an accelerating trend. The technology already has been implanted on smartphones made by Google and Apple that compete against Samsung and also on the latest personal computers powered by Microsoft\\u2019s Windows software.The AI deployment on Samsung\\u2019s new premium watch and ring is narrowly focused on improving and maintaining personal health \\u2014 the main reason most people buy wearable technology.Both Samsung\\u2019s watch and ring are leaning on AI to do a better job of analyzing biometric data collected from the person wearing the devices to customize assessments of their well-being through an \\u201cenergy score\\u201d that will deliver ratings on a one to 100 scale and also make recommendations like a virtual fitness coach.Just as Apple plans to do with its AI services, Samsung\\u2019s new wearable products will collect most sensitive information on the devices themselves. But some data will still be processed through remote computing centers with a \\u201cdefense-grade, multi-layer security platform\\u201d that Samsung likens to a virtual Fort Knox, echoing Apple\\u2019s pledge to corral any personal information that must be processed off a device in a digital fortress. But those promises don\\u2019t necessarily guarantee there won\\u2019t ever be security breaches or other breakdowns that unintentionally exposes personal information to outsiders.Samsung\\u2019s premium phone is the more sophisticated of its latest wearable devices, capable of performing some functions \\u2014 such as flagging sleep apnea \\u2014 that the Galaxy Ring can\\u2019t. However, the ring requires less frequent recharging, equipped with a battery that can last six to seven days before needing to be replenished.But the smartwatch is also in a much more crowded market currently led by Apple, which has been intensifying its focus on health features since entering the market a decade ago. More than 60 million people already use the Samsung Health app that works in tandem with its smartwatches.The health benefits associated with wearable technology have helped spur more people to buy smartwatches, with worldwide sales of the devices expected to approach about $29 billion this year, based on a forecast by the research firm Gartner Inc. That translates to roughly 164 million new smartwatches being worn on wrists this year, with Gartner predicting the annual sales volume sold will rise to 195 million in 2028.Samsung is likely to face more challenges in the smart ring market, even though it won\\u2019t be facing much competition so far. The segment so far has been shaped by startups such as Oura and RingConn that haven\\u2019t made a significant dent so far.\\u201cSmart rings are still an emerging category with no exclusive use cases, with little expectations of growing beyond a niche market\\u201d through 2028, Gartner said in its recent overview of the wearable technology market.The firm expects a small segment that includes smart rings to generate $2.4 billion in sales this year and eventually rise to about $4.6 billion in 2028.Although it will come in nine different sizes, Samsung\\u2019s Galaxy Ring only fits with one kind of software \\u2014 Google\\u2019s Android operating system. That locks out the mostly affluent consumers who own iPhones and often are interested in checking out new forms of technology such as the Galaxy Ring.Samsung also is rolling out its latest attempt to lure more people into buying a foldable phone equipped with two display screens that can be hinged together so the device can be turned into a pseudo-tablet. It\\u2019s a concept that Samsung has pushing since 2019 with minimal success, but the company is continuing to update the device with camera and AI features to feed the niche market. The next-generation model, the Galaxy Z Fold 6, will sell for $1,900.Meanwhile, unionized workers in South Korea declared an indefinite strike to pressure Samsung to accept their calls for higher pays and other benefits. Thousands of members of the National Samsung Electronics Union launched a temporary, three-day strike on Monday. But the union said Wednesday that it was announcing an indefinite strike, accusing the management of being unwilling to negotiate.Samsung claims there have been no disruptions to production.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhatsApp\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSMS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmail\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrint\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopy article link\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSave\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatured Local Savings\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                \\n                Recommended for you\\n                \\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00d7\\nPost a comment as anonymous\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEmoticons \\n\\n\\n[smile]\\n[beam]\\n[wink]\\n[sad]\\n[cool]\\n[innocent]\\n[rolleyes]\\n[whistling]\\n[lol]\\n[huh]\\n[tongue]\\n[love]\\n[sleeping]\\n[yawn]\\n[unsure]\\n[angry]\\n[blink]\\n[crying]\\n[ohmy]\\n[scared]\\n[sleep]\\n[sneaky]\\n[tongue_smile]\\n[thumbdown]\\n[thumbup]\\n[censored]\\n[happybirthday]\\n[ban]\\n[spam]\\n[offtopic]\\n[batman]\\n[ninja]\\n[pirate]\\n[alien]\\n\\n\\n\\nComment Text\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCancel\\n\\n\\nPost comment\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00d7\\nReport\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCancel\\n\\n\\nReport Abuse\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00d7\\n\\nWatch this discussion.\\nStop watching this discussion.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWatch this discussion\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                            Get an email notification whenever someone contributes to the discussion\\n                        \\n\\n                            Notifications from this discussion will be disabled.\\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\nCancel\\n\\n\\n\\nStart watching\\nStop watching\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n View (0) comments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n (0) comments \\n                            \\n                        \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWelcome to the discussion.\\n\\n\\nLog In\\n\\n\\n\\nWe welcome comments, however there are some guidelines:\\n\\nKeep it Clean: Please avoid obscene, vulgar, lewd,\\nracist or sexual language.

Whether you're a rusted-on Pebble early adopter, a park runner with a Garmin, or simply someone curious about the Apple Watch, wearable technology has caught the attention of millions of Americans.\\nThose who have completed an online Masters in Counseling Psychology can appreciate how difficult it can be to untwist the relationship between tech fans and tech addicts\\u2014but what if I were to tell you that wearable tech is helping to drive a new generation of medical research?\\u00a0\\nConsider this\\u2014a device on your hand monitoring your blood pressure, sleeping patterns, and general oxygen levels. In a new study conducted by researchers at the University of Vermont, data from wearables is used to help understand the relationship between sleep and stress. Could wearables enable a brand new generation of medical research?\\nAn Era of Nighttime Disturbances\\nTechnology is something that's all around us. From mobile devices to computers, wearable devices, and increasing numbers of IoT (Internet of Things) items, Americans have more ways than ever before to put off the sleep gremlins and stay attached to their technology for just a little longer.\\nRecent data suggests that as many as nine in ten Americans use some form of technology in the hour before bed\\u2014with research from the National Sleep Foundation indicating that young people were more likely to use stimulating communications devices, such as smartphones, rather than passive devices, such as listening to music on a speaker.\\nThere's an inherent problem with stimulating technology usage\\u2014particularly in the bedroom, where people are meant to rest and recharge after a busy day. When going to bed, your body needs to be able to wind down and relax\\u2014easy to do with few distractive stimulants in play, but much harder if your most recent actions were stimulating the mind and body through elements such as screen lighting and sounds.\\nIn a world where wearing technology is becoming increasingly commonplace, understanding what can be done to provide high-quality sleep frequently is essential. It's well documented that a lack of sleep or poor-quality sleep can lead to increased stress on the immune system\\u2014harming your body's ability to fight against infection and disease. Additionally, a lack of sleep can also increase the risks of contracting conditions such as heart disease or diabetes, conditions that adversely affect the lives of millions of Americans each year.\\nFrom Bicycle Computers to Modern Wearables\\nTo understand how modern wearables came to be, we should first consider how professional athletes can operate at optimal performance. While it's somewhat straightforward to view the recordings of an event and provide feedback, having quantifiable data can help coaches provide detailed feedback on how an athlete's body is physically reacting during an event.\\nIn 1981, the first commercial heart rate monitors became available to purchase, manufactured by Finnish sports instruments company, Polar. These heart rate monitors allowed for data to be collated and gathered while a user was wearing the watch\\u2014allowing for the analysis of cardiac output. This was particularly useful for runners, who sought to understand how their bodies were performing\\u2014whether slowing down or speeding up slightly could impact their performance during a race.\\nAround the same time, a similar innovation came to the cycling industry, with cycle computers that provided speed, distance and time traveled also hitting the market in the 1980s. Over time, it was recognized that with increasingly powerful and miniaturized computers, more and more data could be collated by devices such as heart rate monitors and cycle computers alike.\\nThe late 2000s and 2010s saw a rapid emergence in modern wearables that could gather increasing amounts of health data. Companies such as Fitbit and Garmin came onto the market with digital sensors embedded in watches that could not only provide heart rate data but also track steps, sleep trends, and other critical healthcare data.\\n(Photo : Fabian Albert on Unsplash)\\nTracking Stress During Sleep\\nIn a recent study published in PLOS Digital Health, researchers from the University of Vermont investigated the data produced by a brand of healthcare wearable to identify whether stress levels could be determined simply by using data from a wearable device.\\nIn the longitudinal study, more than 700 college students had healthcare data collated using data from a device known as an Oura ring. Datapoints collected included temperature, heart rate, nightly sleep duration, and breathing rate. Additional surveys were used to collect more subjective responses about emotions and stressors.\\nResults from the survey were promising\\u2014with data suggesting that wearable devices may be helpful in pre-emptively identifying which students may get the most benefit out of college mental health services.\\nOne area of the data that was most interesting was the identification of health trends when comparing young women who identified as stressed. Interestingly, data looking at female participants in the research noted two distinct heart rate curves among women\\u2014notably, those who identified that they were experiencing anxiety or depression were finding it much harder to sleep than those who were not as stressed.\\nNew Opportunities for Wearable Research\\nWhat other opportunities exist in the field of wearable research? As it turns out, the advent of modern, connected activity trackers provides a wealth of opportunities for researchers to understand healthcare data at a population-wide level.\\nTake, for example, heart conditions that are difficult to spot, such as arrhythmia, also known as atrial fibrillation. At a wider level, data can be collated and compared, helping to highlight patients who may have unusual heart rates\\u2014and to urgently flag data if something goes wrong, such as when author Adam Croft woke up in the middle of the night with his Apple Watch informing him that his heart was in atrial fibrillation.\\nAdvancements in the size and variety of healthcare data will hopefully mean that researchers may be able to further develop cohort research into wearable users. Perhaps the next generation of wearables will not only provide valuable healthcare data to end users\\u2014but maybe even save a few lives while doing so.\\n\\n                \\u24d2 2024 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.

wearable sensor positioned on his lower back (Photo courtesy of Tel Aviv University) \\n\\n\\nStep length is recognized as a sensitive and non-invasive metric for assessing a variety of conditions and diseases such as aging, neurological deterioration, neurodegenerative diseases, cognitive decline, and disorders like Alzheimer\\u2019s, Parkinson\\u2019s, and multiple sclerosis. Traditional devices used to measure step length, including camera-based systems and force-sensitive gait mats, are stationary, bulky, and typically confined to specialized clinics and laboratories. While these methods are accurate, they capture only a momentary glimpse of a person's walking ability, which may not accurately reflect their daily functioning. Daily walking patterns can vary with changes in a person\\u2019s fatigue, mood, and medication use. To address these limitations, researchers have developed a machine learning-based interdisciplinary model that accurately estimates step length and can be integrated into a wearable device attached to the lower back with tape, facilitating continuous step monitoring in everyday settings.\\nResearchers at Tel Aviv University (TAU, Tel Aviv, Israel\\u00a0and Ichilov\\u2019s Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center (Tel Aviv, Israell) overcame the limitations of existing step length measurement devices by utilizing IMU (inertial measurement unit) systems. These lightweight and relatively inexpensive sensors are already embedded in every smartphone and smartwatch and can measure walking-related parameters. Previous investigations into IMU-based wearable devices for step length assessment were conducted solely on healthy individuals without walking impairments, relied on small sample sizes that prevented generalization, and involved devices that were uncomfortable and often required multiple sensors. The goal was to create an effective, user-friendly solution suitable for individuals with mobility issues, including the elderly and those with medical conditions, enabling continuous, day-long data collection on step length within the patient's usual environment.\\nIn an article describing the research published on May 25, 2024, in the journal Digital Medicine, the team utilized IMU sensor-based gait data along with step length measurements previously gathered in a conventional setting from 472 individuals with various conditions, including Parkinson\\u2019s disease, mild cognitive impairment, healthy elderly individuals, younger healthy adults, and people with multiple sclerosis. A substantial and varied dataset of 83,569 steps was compiled from these participants. The researchers employed this dataset to train several machine learning models that convert IMU sensor data into accurate step length estimates. To assess the models\\u2019 effectiveness, they tested how well these models could generalize by evaluating their ability to accurately analyze new data not previously used in training, demonstrating the models' robustness in real-world settings.\\n\\u201cWe found that the model called XGBoost is the most accurate and is 3.5 times more accurate than the most advanced biomechanical model currently used to estimate step length,\\u201d said Assaf Zadka, a graduate student in the Department of Biomedical Engineering at TAU, who led the research. \\u201cFor a single step, the average error of our model was 6 cm, compared to 21 cm predicted by the conventional model. When we evaluated an average of 10 steps, we arrived at an error of less than 5 cm, a threshold known in the professional literature as \\u2018the minimum difference that has clinical importance,\\u2019 which allows identifying a significant improvement or decrease in the subject\\u2019s condition. In other words, our model is robust and reliable, and can be used to analyze sensor data from subjects, some with walking difficulties, who were not included in the original training set.\\u201d\\nRelated Links:\\nTel Aviv University\\nTel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center\\n\\n\\n\\nVisit expo >\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGold Member \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tReal-Time Diagnostics Onscreen Viewer\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tGEMweb Live\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGold Member \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPOC Blood Gas Analyzer\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tStat Profile Prime Plus\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSilver Member \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWireless Mobile ECG Recorder\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNR-1207-3/NR-1207-E\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNew \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSurgical Camera\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAIM 4K\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest Critical Care News\\n\\nAptamer-Based Biosensors Could Revolutionize Gastric Cancer Screening and Diagnosis Pocket-Sized Invention Revolutionizes Ability to Swiftly Detect Pathogens in Hospital Setting Cold Plasma to Revolutionize Treatment of Ventilator-Associated Pneumonia and Reduce MortalityNanosized Implantable Sensor to Advance Treatment for Spinal Cord Neurological Disorders and InjuryIngestible Micro-Robot Wirelessly Navigates Stomach for Remote Diagnosis of GI Tract New Cellular Immunotherapy Approach Effective In Treating Metastatic Solid Tumors AI Model Accurately Predicts Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy Survival Wireless Implantable LED Device Treats Deep-Seated Cancers Using Light \\u2018Band-Aid\\u2019 Measures Glucose Levels in Sweat Using Microlaser Technology Stretchable Skin-Conformable Bioelectrodes Demonstrate Promising Capabilities for Healthcare WearablesAI-Powered Tool Combs through Electronic Health Records For Faster Diagnoses of Rare Diseases Wearable Patch Accurately and Continuously Measures Trace Perspiration for Disease Detection Nanorobot with Hidden Weapon Precisely Targets and Kills Cancer Cells Groundbreaking System Combining Leadless Pacemaker with Subcutaneous Defibrillator to Revolutionize Cardiac Care Novel Hydrogel Could Provide Alternative to Pacemakers Novel Capsule Releases Microscopic Robots into Colon to Treat Inflammatory Bowel Disease \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChannels\\n\\n\\nSurgical Techniques\\nview channel\\n\\n\\n\\nBreakthrough AR Surgical System Brings Precision-Enhanced Visualization into the...\\n \\nAdvances in Image-Guided Methods Enabling Intelligent Surgical Robots for Precise...\\n \\nAugmented Reality Headset Gives Surgeons \\\"X-Ray Vision\\\" During Procedures\\n \\nPulsed Field Ablation Procedures Found Safe and Effective For Atrial Fibrillation...\\n\\n\\n Breakthrough AR Surgical System Brings Precision-Enhanced Visualization into the OR \\nState-of-the-art mixed reality and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are revolutionizing the field of surgery.

Photo courtesy of Cambridge University.\\n\\n\\n\\nJuly 17 (UPI) -- Cambridge University said Wednesday its scientists have developed an electric-eel-inspired, jelly-like, battery for use in wearable devices and soft robotics that potentially could be implanted in the brain to deliver drugs or control epilepsy and other neurological conditions.\\nResearchers devised the soft, stretchable 'jelly batteries' by mimicking modified muscle cells, called electrocytes, that eels use to stun prey. These stretchy, sticky, Lego-like layered materials are capable of delivering electric current, the British university said in a news release.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe self-healing batteries can stretch 10-fold without any reduction in their conductivity, the first time a single material has combined the two properties, according to the research published in the peer-reviewed U.S. journal Science Advances.\\nThe batteries are made of 3D networks of polymers, or hydrogels, that contain more than 60% water and are bonded in place by on-off interactions that precisely control the jelly's mechanical properties to mimic the characteristics of human tissue.\\nAdvertisement\\nThat characteristic makes hydrogels a perfect fit for soft robotics and bioelectronics, provided they also offer the conductivity and ability to flex lengthways.\\n\\\"It's difficult to design a material that is both highly stretchable and highly conductive, since those two properties are normally at odds with one another,\\\" said first author Stephen O'Neill from Cambridge's Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry.\\n\\\"Typically, conductivity decreases when a material is stretched.\\\"\\nThe team were able to overcome the issue by charging the normally neutrally charged polymers of the hydrogels to make them conductive, said co-author Dr. Jade McCune, who works in the same lab as O'Neill.\\n\\\"By changing the salt component of each gel, we can make them sticky and squish them together in multiple layers, so we can build up a larger energy potential.\\n\\\"Conventional electronics use rigid metallic materials with electrons as charge carriers, while the jelly batteries use ions to carry charge, like electric eels. The hydrogels stick strongly to each other because of reversible bonds that can form between the different layers, using barrel-shaped molecules called cucurbiturils that are like molecular handcuffs,\\\" McCune said.\\nThese strong bonds are what allow the jelly batteries to be stretched without the layers detaching from each other and critically, without any loss of conductivity.\\nAdvertisement\\nThe team believe the unique properties of the jelly batteries, particularly their softness and ability to mold to human tissue, mean they hold great promise for future use in biomedical implants.\\n\\\"We can customize the mechanical properties of the hydrogels so they match human tissue,\\\" said research lead Professor Oren Scherman, director of Cambridge's Melville Laboratory for Polymer Synthesis.\\n\\\"Since they contain no rigid components such as metal, a hydrogel implant would be much less likely to be rejected by the body or cause the build-up of scar tissue.\\\"\\nScherman noted that the hydrogels also are incredibly durable polymers that, in addition to withstanding being squashed without permanently losing their original shape, could repair themselves after sustaining damage.\\nThe researchers next plan to evaluate the hydrogels' suitability for use in a range of medical applications by conducting experiments using them in live organisms.\\nThe project was conducted with funding from the European Research Council and the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, part of UK Research and Innovation.\\nRead More\\nFDA signs off on first over-the-counter continuous glucose monitor\\nNeurological conditions the leading cause of ill health globally, study finds\\nQualcomm strikes deal to produce tech component for Meta's VR products \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLatest Headlines\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScience News // 9 minutes ago\\nScience explains mind-altering effects of 'magic' mushrooms\\n  \\\"Magic\\\" mushrooms achieve their psychedelic effects by temporarily scrambling a brain network involved in introspective thinking like daydreaming and remembering, a new study reports.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScience News // 14 hours ago\\nNASA nixes VIPER lunar rover project\\n July 17 (UPI) -- NASA is ending its VIPER lunar rover project created in partnership with Lockheed Martin and General Motors, the space agency announced Wednesday.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScience News // 19 hours ago\\nNASA ships critical rocket stage to Florida for Artemis II mission to moon\\n July 17 (UPI) -- NASA on Tuesday rolled out from Louisiana a crucial rocket stage on the way to Florida as part of NASA's Artemis II mission to send humans on the moon again.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScience News // 22 hours ago\\nNASA: Meteor flew over New York City, Statue of Liberty\\n July 17 (UPI) -- A meteor traveling 34,000 mph blasted through Earth's atmosphere before breaking up above midtown Manhattan on Tuesday morning, NASA said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nScience News // 1 day ago\\nScience of smell might help make food in space more appealing\\n  Food tends to taste bland in space, making it tough for astronauts to eat enough to stay healthy.

But, seeing that Samsung also makes an array of watches, the team has gone the extra mile to make its wearables work together, and actually designed the Galaxy Ring to work holistically with the Galaxy Watch.\\u00a0I had the chance to chat with Drew Blackard, VP of Mobile Product Management at Samsung Electronics America, at a Galaxy Unpacked Event in NYC, and while rocking both a Galaxy Ring and a Galaxy Watch might be for the \\u201csuper enthusiast\\u201d at first, there are some other reasons for it like sleep tracking.\\u00a0(Image credit: Future / Matt Evans)\\u201cI don\\u2019t like to sleep with a watch, but I\\u2019ve been sleeping with the ring and it\\u2019s super comfortable,\\u201d noted Blackard. And that\\u2019s a common trope of folks who want metrics on sleep but also don\\u2019t find it comfortable to wear a smartwatch on their wrist overnight. Plus, there\\u2019s always the chance it could buzz or glow and wake you.Prime Day deals are here - shop our expert picksMaybe even more important, though, is a battery life benefit that Blackard described: \\u201cIf you\\u2019re wearing the two together, the devices can intelligently determine which sensors to use in the ring to offset some of the power consumption. So you may actually get more battery life out of the ring if you\\u2019re wearing both at the same time.\\u201dThat\\u2019s a potential big win, and Samsung noted that you can save up to 30% power on the Ring or a Watch, since it\\u2019s deciding which sensors it needs on and which device is most accurate. Blackard expanded that since you have multiple reads from potential sensors on your wrist and on your finger, \\u201con-device intelligence can determine how to balance those readings and get you a more accurate step count, heart rate, among other things.\\u201d(Image credit: Future)The level of intelligence between both devices is impressive and does create some unique experiences. We\\u2019ll be testing them as we go hands-on, but it could be a step up for accuracy, considering that Samsung might opt to use the Ring over the Watch or vice-versa.Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.It also speaks to Samsung\\u2019s unique entry into the smart-ring space, as they already have experience with wearable devices. They expect some folks to pair a Galaxy Ring with an existing smartwatch, or potentially the Galaxy Watch 7 or Ultra and want to deliver a compelling experience.Between the promised higher level of accuracy for certain metrics and up to 30% better battery life, Samsung hopes these are two additional reasons to choose the Galaxy Ring over competitors like the Oura Ring or the Ultrahuman.In the meantime, you can read our hands-on with the Galaxy Ring here and TechRadar\\u2019s Editor At Large Lance Ulanoff's interview with Samsung\\u2019s Dr. Hon Pak here.You Might Also LikeHands on: Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 review \\u2013 tougher, smarter ...Samsung Galaxy AI compatibility explained: which phones have ...Samsung Galaxy Watch 7: price, release date, features and ...\\n\\nJacob KrolSocial Links NavigationUS Managing Editor NewsJacob Krol is the US Managing Editor, News for TechRadar.

We look forward to having the other health insurance organizations in Colorado match this important benefit and update their coverage policies accordingly.\\u201d\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSubscribe to NoCamels

DOI: 10.1038/s41591-024-03094-4\\n             \\n\\nA study published in Nature Medicine examined if a commercially-available fitness tracker and smartphone could continuously monitor the response to medications, and provide clinical information similar to in-person hospital assessment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe wearable devices, consisting of a wrist band and connected smartphone, collected a vast amount of data on the response to two different medications prescribed as part of a clinical trial called RATE-AF.\\nLed by researchers from the cardiac group at the University of Birmingham, the team used artificial intelligence to help analyze over 140 million datapoints for heart rate in 53 individuals over 20 weeks. They found that digoxin and beta-blockers had a similar effect on heart rate, even after accounting for differences in physical activity. This was in contrast to previous studies that had only assessed the short-term impact of digoxin.\\nA neural network that took account of missing information was developed to avoid an over-optimistic view of the wearable data stream. Using this approach, the team found that the wearables were equivalent to standard tests often used in hospitals and clinical trials that require staff time and resources. The average age of participants in the study was 76 years, highlighting possible future value regardless of age or experience with technology.\\nProfessor Dipak Kotecha from the Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences at the University of Birmingham and the lead author of the study said, \\\"People across the world are increasingly using wearable devices in their daily lives to help monitor their activity and health status. This study shows the potential to use this new technology to assess the response to treatment and make a positive contribution to the routine care of patients.\\\"\\n\\\"Heart conditions such as atrial fibrillation and heart failure are expected to double in prevalence over the next few decades, leading to a large burden on patients as well as substantial health care cost. This study is an exciting showcase for how artificial intelligence can support new ways to help treat patients better.\\\"\\n\\nMore information:\\n                                                    Simrat K.

But the holy grail is probably getting it right for blood pressure monitoring without a cuff, because raised blood pressure is the leading cause of death in the world [1]. Many have tried and failed, but industry is persisting: numerous devices are on the market, several different technologies have been developed, hundreds of patents are registered every year [2], and some devices already have regulatory approval [3]. However, to convince the die-hard blood pressure critic is a different ball game.Cuffless blood pressure devices rely on a range of different technologies to estimate blood pressure changes, with most using pulse transit time with ECG, or pulse wave analysis combined with proprietary algorithms (and often artificial intelligence)\\u2014relying mostly on an initial calibration with a cuff. Other potential technologies include facial video processing or ultrasound, which may not require calibration with a cuff [2]. Technical challenges with devices may include their accuracy, stability of the measurements post calibration, and how machine learning technology is implemented\\u2014in other words, how reliant the algorithm is on hemodynamic components and other demographic inputs, such as sex and age [2].Although authorities such as the American Heart Association [4] and European Society of Hypertension [2] recognise the major potential of cuffless blood pressure monitoring, both have published statements against their use in clinical practice due to accuracy issues, and uncertainty regarding their usefulness in clinical practice. The question is not so much whether a cuffless wearable device can produce a blood pressure comparable to a cuff device\\u2014since this has been proven relatively easy to do\\u2014but rather whether cuffless wearables can track blood pressure when calm, sleeping and excited [5].At the same time, we have to admit that blood pressure is a very challenging physiological measure. It changes from second-to-second, day-and-night, and during winter-and-summer, when we are calm or excited [6]. Even our \\u2018gold standard\\u2019 method for diagnosing hypertension, cuff-based 24-h blood pressure monitoring, has poor intra-individual reproducibility across two different days [7].From a clinical perspective it is understandable that for cuffless blood pressure monitoring to be accepted, there needs to be convincing evidence that the device can track pressure in a similar fashion as (imperfect) 24-h cuff-based monitors. This is due to strong evidence that 24-h cuff blood pressure predicts death and cardiovascular events, with nighttime blood pressure being the most potent predictor of outcome [8,9,10]. If a cuffless device does not track cuff-based blood pressure, how would a clinician feel confident to make treatment decisions? For this reason, the European Society of Hypertension now recommends stringent criteria for cuffless device manufacturers to validate the accuracy of their products in tracking blood pressure [5]. These include procedures including six validation tests that were developed to evaluate different aspects of so-called \\u201cintermittent\\u201d cuffless devices: (1) a static test similar to validation tests used for cuff-based devices (absolute accuracy in blood pressure measurement); (2) a device position test (whether it captures changes in hydrostatic pressure); (3) medication treatment test (accuracy in tracking blood pressure lowering); (4) awake/asleep test over 24-h (tracking change in blood pressure); (5) exercise test (tracking blood pressure increases); (6) and the recalibration test (stability in cuff calibration blood pressure over time) [5].From a patient\\u2019s perspective, it is understandable that comfort is tops [11]. A wrist-band, patch or ring that does not disturb nighttime sleep or disrupt daily activities, or cause an anxiety response when the cuff inflates [12], would be much easier to wear for months, let alone 24\\u2009hours.Being a blood pressure critic myself, understanding the challenges of currently accepted methods and cuffless devices, I performed a 24-h blood pressure monitoring self-test. While not claiming a flawless study by any means (with an N\\u2009=\\u20091), it merely serves to demonstrate the challenges that we face. I monitored my own blood pressure while using five different devices simultaneously: cuff-based ambulatory monitoring (left and right arm) with two validated WatchBP O3 devices (MicroLife, Switzerland) [13], and three wearable cuffless devices: the Aktiia wrist-wearable (Aktiia SA, Switzerland) [14, 15], Biobeat chest patch (Biobeat Technologies, Israel) [16, 17], and the CAR-T ring (Skylabs, South Korea) [18, 19]. At the start of the 24-h period, the Aktiia device was calibrated using its own supplied upper-arm cuff. The Biobeat and CAR-T ring were calibrated according to device specifications using a validated iHealth Feel (iHealthlabs, USA) upper-arm blood pressure cuff. I then evaluated how well all devices tracked my blood pressure while I was awake, asleep and when watching the 2023 Rugby World Cup final on television (early morning in Sydney). Being an avid Springbok rugby fan, I anticipated a substantial blood pressure response. This is likely a good emotional stressor, since in New Zealand, a strong upswing in acute cardiac hospital admissions during Rugby World Cup tournaments were seen when the All Blacks participated [20].When reviewing the systolic blood pressure\\u00a0results (Fig.\\u00a01 Panel A), it is firstly clear that despite the two cuff-based devices inflating at precisely the same second, there were clear points of discrepancy while awake, asleep and during the rugby match. This may have been due to movement, body position or other factors. However, there were no statistical differences between average awake (p\\u2009=\\u20090.35), asleep (p\\u2009=\\u20090.88) or rugby (p\\u2009=\\u20090.35) blood pressure readings between the left and right arm devices. It is also relevant to mention that systolic blood pressure dipped from an average of 113\\u2009mmHg when awake, to 91\\u2009mmHg when asleep, rising to an average of 123\\u2009mmHg when watching the rugby. Since the blood pressure of the two cuff devices was not statistically different, they were combined and averaged for comparison with the three cuffless devices.Fig. 1: 24-H systolic blood pressure, while awake, asleep and while watching the Rugby World Cup Final.A Left vs right arm ambulatory cuffs; and average of left and right arm cuff blood pressure vs. B Aktiia wrist-worn device; C Biobeat chest patch; and D CAR-T ring.Full size imageThe Aktiia device (Fig.\\u00a01 Panel B) produced comparable systolic blood pressure when awake (p\\u2009=\\u20090.73) and during the rugby match (p\\u2009=\\u20090.54), but reported higher values when asleep (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001). This finding aligns with our previous independent comparison study in 41 patients [21].The Biobeat patch device (Fig.\\u00a01 Panel C) produced lower systolic blood pressure when awake (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001) and during the rugby match (p\\u2009=\\u20090.005), and higher blood pressure when sleeping (p\\u2009<\\u20090.001), suggesting strong reliance on the original calibration pressure.The CAR-T ring (Fig.\\u00a01 Panel D) showed lower systolic blood pressure when awake (p\\u2009=\\u20090.002), but was comparable when sleeping (p\\u2009=\\u20090.56) and when watching the rugby (p\\u2009=\\u20090.13).In Fig.\\u00a02, similar device comparisons are shown but for heart rate across the 24-h period. Overall, the cuffless devices tracked heart rate quite well compared to the heart rate recorded by the cuff devices.Fig. 2: 24-H heart rate, while awake, asleep and while watching the Rugby World Cup Final.A Left vs right arm ambulatory cuffs; and average of left and right arm cuff heart rate vs. B Aktiia wrist-worn device; C Biobeat chest patch; and D CAR-T ring.Full size imageThe comparisons above focus only on systolic blood pressure\\u00a0and heart rate, but it is important to also review performance in diastolic blood pressure. In Fig.\\u00a03 comparisons are presented in Panel A firstly showing no statistical differences between the left and right cuff-based devices for systolic, diastolic blood pressure and heart rate. In Panel B the differences between the cuffless and cuff-based devices are shown for 24-h, awake, asleep and rugby match recordings, indicating for diastolic blood pressure, mainly overestimation of blood pressure by cuffless devices during the nighttime, but no statistical differences during awake or rugby recordings. Heart rate recordings were comparable between cuff-based devices and the Aktiia and BioBeat devices across the 24-h, but the CAR-T ring underestimated heart rate during the awake period (mean 78 vs 82 bpm).Fig. 3: Differences in average blood pressure and heart rate over 24 h using various blood pressure devices.A Differences between left and right arm cuff-based devices, and differences between cuffless and cuff-based devices for B systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate.Full size imageIt is clear from the figures that each device type has its own features that may require highlighting.\\n\\nWhere the cuff-based ambulatory devices were programmed to take readings every 20\\u2009min, the cuffless devices are usually programmed to only take a reading when the person is not moving. How would this influence \\u2018true\\u2019 blood pressure? Since it is known that a cuff inflation causes an anxiety response [12], would that mean that cuff-based ambulatory blood pressure should be higher overall than cuffless measurements?\\n\\n\\nAlso, although the data presented here were generated from current cuffless devices, the companies continuously strive to improve software algorithms, and therefore often launch updates of their mobile device applications. Hence, improved versions may already be available for some.\\n\\n\\nWhere a patient can usually only endure one 24-h cuff-based blood pressure measurement at a time, cuffless devices are used for weeks and months without the user being aware that readings are taken. The benefit of weeks or months\\u2019 worth of data compared to a single 24-h period, is perhaps underestimated.\\n\\n\\nThe number of readings taken by the different devices also varies substantially. For instance, during nighttime 16 cuff blood pressure readings were taken, 10 Aktiia readings, 10 Biobeat readings, and 58 CAR-T readings.\\n\\nWith blood pressure changing all the time, it is likely that when more readings are taken, it may be better than fewer. In fact, when reflecting on current clinical practice mostly relying on a single snapshot clinic\\u00a0blood pressure taken (often imprecisely) for decision-making [22], one cannot help but wondering whether it is time to completely overhaul how blood pressure is measured in primary care. Current blood pressure measurement practices across thousands of busy clinics is certainly not \\u2018good enough\\u2019\\u2014the question is when cuffless readings will be good enough?\\n\\n\\nReferencesGBD 2019 Risk Factors Collaborators.

These Spy Kids-esque wearables can keep tabs on just about every aspect of your health: sleep, recovery, blood oxygen levels and respiratory rates; some can even track electrical activity of the heart (known as ECG). As a certified personal trainer and weightlifter, I used my expertise to test 14 of the best fitness trackers for this guide. The Garmin Venu 3 won me over as best fitness tracker overall, and I found several others worthy of praise.\\nI used my expertise to test 14 of the best fitness trackers for this guide and the Garmin Venu 3 won ...

Since these devices are highly personal, the best fitness tracker for you will depend on your needs, training goals and individual preferences. That\\u2019s why I included a variety of options\\u2014everything from a running-specific tracker to the best Apple Watch\\u2014so you can find something on this list that works for you. I\\u2019ve tested several top picks over the past few months to see how they\\u2019ve held up over time. Read on for my in-depth review of the seven best fitness trackers of 2024. For more on how to make the most of these wearables, read my guide to how to use a fitness tracker.\\nBest Fitness Tracker OverallA Versatile Watch That Excels In Every CategoryAmazonGarmin Venu 3$455 at AmazonOur score: 9/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: 5 ATM | Display: AMOLED touchscreen | Battery life: 14 days | ECG monitor: Yes | Compatibility: Apple, AndroidWhat\\u2019s notable:Detailed health insights, including in-depth recovery metrics and sleep coachingExtremely accurate readings (down to which muscles are targeted during exercise)Built-in workouts, including exercises for wheelchair usersWhat could be better:Doesn\\u2019t automatically sense the type of activity you\\u2019re doing like other trackersBulky profile\\nThe Garmin Venu 3 was my first choice for a fitness tracker after weeks of testing. I consistently gravitated towards this tracker even on my off-days of training. Out of all of the trackers I tested, the Venu 3 was the most accurate while still being easy to use. The Garmin Venu 3\\u2019s large 1.4-inch touchscreen and bright display made it easy to check my stats mid-workout and cycle through different health features (of which there are many).\\n\\nAesthetically, the Venu\\u2019s size makes it less discreet than other options. There\\u2019s no mistaking it for a watch, but the silicone band and stainless steel bezel made it one of the more attractive fitness trackers I tried. And although it was bulkier, it felt surprisingly lightweight compared to trackers of similar size.\\nThe Garmin Venu 3 allows you to track sets and reps while weightlifting.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nA step up from Garmin\\u2019s Venu 2, the Venu 3 is also geared toward average gym-goers but includes upgraded features like sleep coaching, post-workout recovery insights and a more advanced heart rate sensor. I found the recovery time predictions useful for planning my daily movement after working out, including how many walks to take and when to go to bed. I was also able to create my workouts within the Garmin Connect app and load them onto the watch, down to the sets, reps and exact exercises. Other notable features include more than 30 preloaded sports apps and workouts, as well as personalized sleep coaching. Overall, I found the Garmin Venu 3 to be an advanced watch that takes a holistic approach to fitness without being intimidating to use.\\n The Garmin Venu has become something of a personal coach to me after training with it for four months. I\\u2019ve seen improved results in the gym like PR\\u2019s (personal records) during lifting and greater endurance after following the watch\\u2019s post-workout recovery advice and sleep tips. The battery life also blows away any other tracker I\\u2019ve used. After noticing mid-workout that my watch was down to less than 5% in battery, the power-saving mode helped it hold on for not only the rest of my workout but three more hours after that. I do wish the interface was a bit more intuitive. Navigating to features on the watch like the post-workout summary can be a bit confusing, even after using the watch consistently.\\nThe 2024 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards are here: Explore our 150 top-recommended items across categories after extensive research and testing.Best Fitness Tracker For BeginnersA No-Fuss Design That Checks All The BoxesAmazonFitbit Charge 6 Our score: 8.5/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: 5 ATM | Display: AMOLED touchscreen | Battery life: 7 days | ECG monitor: Yes | Compatibility: iPhone and AndroidWhat\\u2019s notable:Weekly progress reports measure improvement over time across a variety of areas\\u00a0Lightweight fit and slim designBenchmarks for sleep quality and duration\\u00a0Easy to use and understandWhat could be better:Initial setup had hiccups; had to perform a hard reset to sync with phoneNo physical buttons\\n\\nFor beginners looking to track their workouts in a seamless and manageable way, I recommend the Fitbit Charge 6. If you\\u2019re just starting out with a regular exercise program, the last thing you want to do is complicate your routine by introducing an elaborate fitness tracker. The Charge 6 is the brand\\u2019s latest iteration in its Charge series. Of the trackers I tested, it was the simplest to use while offering a surprising level of versatility and accuracy, given its basic design.When I took the Charge 6 on a hike, it tracked my average pace.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nThe Charge 6 can do just about anything most trackers can do: count steps and distance, track sleep (including sleep stages), recognize when you\\u2019re engaging in one of nearly 40 different workouts and monitor key health indicators, like irregular heart rhythms, stress, moods and menstrual cycles. The Charge 6 also features a more advanced heart rate monitor than its predecessors, which paid off in its level of accuracy during my testing. It kept up with my heart rate during high-intensity workouts, which is typically where I find most trackers fail in their ability to measure my varying heart rate accurately. I went from 160 bpm (beats per minute) during the middle of a set to around 120 bpm during rest\\u2014all within a 30-second to one-minute window\\u2014and the Charge 6\\u2019s tracking was right in line with my control device through it all (the Polar H10 Chest Strap).\\nUnlike other trackers that can make it hard to break down what all of the numbers mean, the Charge 6\\u2019s insights were straightforward. It communicated updates to me via weekly progress reports and daily scores for sleep and stress management\\u2014all of which broke down my stats using cute graphics, bright colors and easy-to-follow insights.\\nAfter using this tracker for four months, I still enjoy the Fitbit\\u2019s simple interface and uncomplicated design. I\\u2019ve found, however, that the accuracy of the heart rate tracking can be inconsistent. During a few lifting sessions, the heart rate tracking got a slow start and was off for a few sets compared to my control (the Polar H10 chest strap) before catching up by the middle to end of my workout. This was somewhat annoying, although it didn\\u2019t seem to skew my overall post-workout summary data, which was usually still in line with my control for metrics like estimated calories burned and average heart rate.Best Fitness Tracker For Apple UsersA Top-Rated Smartwatch That Keeps You Moving AmazonApple Watch Series 9 Our score: 8.5/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: WR50 | Display: Retina LTPO OLED touchscreen | Battery life: 18 hours (36 hours in low power mode) | ECG monitor: Yes | Compatibility: iPhoneWhat\\u2019s notable:Seamless integration with iPhone and the ability to go completely phone-freeCustomizable with a wide variety of bands and facesAttractive design and scratch-proof faceWhat could be better:Battery life is much shorter than other trackersOnly compatible with iPhones\\nFor Apple users looking for the most convenient option, the Apple Watch Series 9 is my top choice. Equipped with more features than the SE and more affordable than the Apple Watch Ultra, the Series 9 checks all the boxes for an everyday, high-performing fitness tracker. It was a close second to the Garmin Venu 3 for my favorite tracker for training, in large part due to its advanced heart rate tracking. It accurately tracked my heart rate variability, including how long I spent in certain zones, my walking heart rate and how long it took my body to return to normal, post-exercise.\\nHowever, the 9 is a smartwatch at its core; it can\\u2019t compete with Garmin\\u2019s workout analytics and training feedback, or the superior integration with the Garmin Connect app. While I did find it convenient to have all of my workout stats recorded and readily available in my iPhone\\u2019s Health app, it doesn\\u2019t summarize your information in the way the Connect app does or offer recommendations for recovery.The Apple Watch 9 could detect what stroke I was swimming and for how long, which is a unique ... [+] feature among the other fitness trackers I tested.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nSomething the 9 offered that the Garmin doesn\\u2019t, though, is the ability to detect movement automatically. I appreciated how quickly the Apple Watch Series 9 could sense the type of exercise I was doing, so I never had to manually record activities like outdoor walks or yoga. It even detected which stroke I was swimming when I tested it in the pool. As for its design, the Series 9 (like other Apple wearables) is a sleek watch that\\u2019s aesthetically much more advanced than a often-clunkier traditional fitness tracker. For Apple users looking for a more advanced smartwatch that can track your workouts, you\\u2019ll be hard-pressed to find a better option than the Series 9.\\nAfter consistently using the Apple Watch and comparing it to others I\\u2019ve tested and tried, the Series 9\\u2019s seamless integration with my iPhone makes it one of the most convenient fitness trackers to use among the ones I tested. Having all of my health information in one place on my phone\\u2014rather than in a companion app\\u2014makes it easy to keep close tabs on my overall health and to monitor progress over a longer period of time. However, the short battery life proved to be a real pain point with this tracker. Because I have to charge the watch almost as frequently as I do my phone, it discouraged me from using the Apple Watch compared to other trackers because I found it hard to keep up with charging two devices on a daily basis.Best Budget Fitness TrackerAccuracy Meets Affordability In This Fitbit DupeAmazonAmazfit Bip 3 Pro Buy From AmazonOur score: 8/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: 5 ATM | Display: TFT touchscreen | Battery life: 14 days | ECG monitor: No | Compatibility: iPhone, AndroidWhat\\u2019s notable:Accuracy is on par with more expensive modelsMid-sized touchscreen with comfortable silicone strapTracks over 60 different activitiesLonger battery life than mostWhat could be better:Limited strength-training insightsNot the most aesthetically appealing design\\nIf you don\\u2019t want to spend more than $100 on a fitness tracker, I recommend the Amazfit Bip Pro 3. While it\\u2019s not the best-looking or most feature-rich tracker, it gets the job done and was accurate across heart rate, activity and sleep tracking (for metrics like time spent in bed and minutes spent awake). When I first unboxed it, the square screen and thick silicone band immediately reminded me of the Fitbit Versa, and based on its comparable tracking options, I can confirm it\\u2019s a pretty solid dupe. (The newest model of the Fitness Versa, the Versa 4, retails for $200.)During my weightlifting sessions, the Amazfit Bip Pro 3 accurately measured my heart rate compared ... [+] to my control.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nThe watch\\u2019s interface is intuitive and didn\\u2019t require so much as a glance through the user manual. I also liked that I had an abundance of activity tracking options to choose from. However, the post-workout insights were varied. For weight training, they\\u2019re limited to heart rate data. Cardio-based activities, like a treadmill run, come with more detailed insights. Despite the somewhat meager training insights, I still found it to be a user-friendly tracker that offers value for the price.Best Fitness Tracker For RunnersGet A Personalized Training Plan For Your Next RaceAmazonGarmin Forerunner 265 Our score: 8/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: 5 ATM | Display: Colorful AMOLED touchscreen | Battery life: 20 hours in GPS-only mode, 13 days in smartwatch mode | ECG monitor: Yes | Compatibility: iPhone, AndroidWhat\\u2019s notable:Advanced GPS tracking, great for those who train outdoorsTraining readiness score that gives recommendations for workout intensityMore buttons on the watch that make it easier to use mid-workout, including a start/stop timerPersonalized training insights for specific races or eventsBright display that\\u2019s easy to read in sunlightWhat could be better:Fit is bulkyPricier option\\nThe most feature-rich tracker I tested, the Garmin Forerunner 265 is an ideal option for runners, outdoor enthusiasts and anyone with specific training goals. Like its name suggests, it\\u2019s heavy on the running-centric features, like built-in workouts, distance-specific pacing strategies and realtime performance readings. While I\\u2019m not much of a runner myself, I still found some of these functions useful. The training readiness score recommends workout intensity based on the quantity and quality of your sleep, stress levels and heart rate variability. After a poor night of rest, for instance, my training readiness score wasn\\u2019t nearly as high as after I\\u2019d had a good night\\u2019s sleep, which told me it probably wasn\\u2019t the best day for an intense session.The Forerunner 265 estimates your running power, or the amount of power applied to a run, based on ... [+] factors like pace and wind conditions.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nI also let my fianc\\u00e9\\u2014who often goes on long-distance runs and rucks\\u2014give it a spin. He loved the running power feature, which predicted how much force he applied to his run and how to maximize his workouts based on factors like the intensity of the wind. (Anyone who\\u2019s experienced springtime in Colorado knows the wind is no joke.) Design-wise, the Garmin Forerunner 265 has a rugged look and a sturdier, durable feel. For endurance athletes and outdoor enthusiasts looking for a robust option, the Forerunner 265 is a clear winner.Best Fitness Tracker For WomenA Small But Mighty Watch With Impressive AccuracyAmazonGarmin Lily 2Our score: 9/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: 5 ATM | Display: Liquid crystal touchscreen | Battery life: 5 days | ECG monitor: Yes | Compatibility: iPhone, AndroidWhat\\u2019s notable:Lightweight design and feel that made it the most comfortable to sleep withDetailed post-workout insights for a variety of activities, weightlifting includedComes in a variety of soft neutral colors, including a brown leather optionOffers features like fertility trackingWhat could be better:Watch face is on the smaller side, making interface navigation trickyNo buttons, and screen can be unresponsive at times\\nWhile most wearables can keep close tabs on your menstrual cycle, if you want to track your ovulation, peak fertility days and pregnancy, the Garmin Lily 2 is your best option. It was the smallest tracker I tested, but it held its own against some of the more advanced watches on the docket.The Garmin Lily comes in a vibrant lilac color, as well as gold, bronze and silver. Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nSimilar to the Venu 3, this tracker measures energy expenditure by updating your body battery with recommended rest times and activity levels, and it also highlights which muscles you worked during physical activity. After a strength-training session, the Lily\\u2019s post-workout app summary listed the types of exercises I performed, from barbell squats to sumo-stance deadlifts. Named the most stylish in Forbes Vetted\\u2019s best smartwatches for women guide, the tracker also features thoughtful design touches that I appreciated, like a patterned lens, hidden display option and the choice between a leather or nylon strap that made it feel less like a piece of fitness tech and more of a fashion accessory. And despite the superlative category named here, this watch isn\\u2019t just for women: If you\\u2019re looking for a smaller, stylish wearable or want one with fertility tracking features, the Lily 2 is the best choice.Best Fitness Tracker For Android UsersAdvanced Health Insights With A Smartwach DesignAmazonSamsung Galaxy Watch6 Our score: 8/10 | Heart rate monitor: Yes | GPS: Yes | Water resistance: IP68 | Display: AMOLED touchscreen | Battery life: 22 hours | ECG monitor: Yes | Compatibility: AndroidWhat\\u2019s notable:Sleek design; large touchscreen with slim profileLightweightPersonalized heart rate zonesMore affordable than the Apple Watch with comparable featuresWhat could be better:Shorter battery life than other optionsDoesn\\u2019t offer the same level of activity tracking as dedicated sports watches\\nSitting squarely at the intersection of fitness tracker and smartwatch, the Samsung Galaxy Watch6 offers smartphone capabilities for Android users that are similar to Apple\\u2019s, but with slightly more advanced health tracking. (Testing the Galaxy Watch6 may have been one of the only times I\\u2019ve second-guessed my choice in a smartphone.) I liked how I could set personalized heart rate zones, which notified me once I hit my target zone. Although this feature is probably more beneficial to runners than other types of athlete, I enjoyed using it for strength training, particularly for workouts when my intensity is sometimes lacking.The Samsung Galaxy 6 has a bigger face than other trackers I tested, yet was one of the most ... [+] lightweight.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nLightweight, comfortable and easy to adjust, the Galaxy Watch6 felt more like a second skin. Its battery life was slightly disappointing, though likely a byproduct of its hybrid design. And compared to true fitness watches like Garmin\\u2019s, it has a couple of limitations. While I liked the Galaxy\\u2019s personalized heart rate tracking, it doesn\\u2019t track heart rate variability (or the time between each heartbeat) like the Garmin Venu 3, Lily 2 or Forerunner 265 each do. The Venu 3 and Forerunner 265 also edged out the Galaxy when it came to GPS tracking and in-depth post-workout insights. All things considered, I found the Galaxy Watch6 to be an excellent option for Android users who want to keep tabs on their workouts and health but ultimately prefer a smartwatch design (and the tracking limitations that come with it) to a true fitness tracker.\\nMORE FROMFORBES VETTEDBest Prime Day iPad Deals: Score Up To 24% On A New Tablet And AccessoriesByCam VigliottaForbes StaffThe Best Prime Day MacBook Deals Include 23% Off The MacBook AirByLuke FaterForbes Staff\\nOther Fitness Trackers I TestedI put 13 different fitness trackers through a series of test to find the overall best.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nApple Watch SE (7/10): While not quite on a par with the Series 9 features- or size-wise, the SE is a solid alternative for Apple users looking to spend a little less. It\\u2019s easy to use, accurate and stylish, plus offers a similar range of strap and watch face options. However, the SE is more of a smartwatch than a fitness tracker, so it doesn\\u2019t provide as much data for sleep and health tracking.\\nApple Watch Ultra (7.5/10): I found the Ultra 2\\u2019s feature-heavy interface to be overkill. More serious athletes may benefit from the extra data and tracking capabilities this watch offers, but the average fit person or everyday user likely won\\u2019t have much use for the majority of these features. The Series 9 is easier to use, less bulky and about $400 less, making it the better choice for most.\\nCoros Pace 3 (7/10): Although the Coros offered incredibly detailed tracking for endurance activities and cardio-based workouts, I found the interface trickier to navigate than others, and the bulky size made for an awkward fit.\\nOura Ring (7/10): I found the minimalist design of the Oura more aesthetically appealing than a traditional wearable, but the tracker wasn\\u2019t functional enough to incorporate into my regular workout routine. Because it doesn\\u2019t have a screen, it took more of an effort to check my stats mid-workout. When I did review my progress in the app, the data was inaccurate compared to my control. The sleep tracking on the Oura is exceptional, and provides in-depth data on sleep stages and sleep quality. This fitness tracker could be a good option for people more interested in improving their rest.\\nWithings ScanWatch Light (6.5/10): Aesthetically, the Withings was perhaps my favorite fitness tracker; its polished design is more watch-like than others I tested. Unfortunately, the heart rate tracking was inconsistent during my workouts, which rendered any post-workout data unreliable.\\nWhoop (6/10): Post-workout insights like heart rate and estimated calorie burn were inconsistent compared to my control and to other trackers I tested. I also found the app interface a bit overwhelming, but advanced athletes or gym-goers willing to spend more time upfront with the device may find it appealing. The minimalist design was also a roadblock for me. I found it inconvenient to have to unlock my phone mid-workout to check the app for basic metrics like heart rate and time elapsed. I did, however, appreciate the insights from Whoop\\u2019s strain score (similar to Garmin\\u2019s training readiness score), which monitors how much energy you\\u2019ve exerted and offers recommendations for recovery (although my score was lower than expected since the heart rate tracking was off).\\nXiaomi Mi Smart Band 8 (5/10):  Tracking was inaccurate and inconsistent across a variety of workouts and activities on this budget tracker.\\nHow I Tested The Best Fitness Trackers\\nThe best fitness trackers should provide accurate tracking, good battery life, a comfortable fit and a design that\\u2019s appealing to you. They should support an active lifestyle with a variety of health and activity tracking options, and they should be easy to use. Based on my experience as a personal trainer and on my weeks of testing these devices, I found that you\\u2019re less likely to use a tracker if the interface is complicated, if you can\\u2019t make sense of the metrics or if it\\u2019s a hassle to use while exercising.\\n\\u201cThe number one thing to consider is whether you truly believe the tracker is going to enhance your experience in fitness and training,\\u201d says Josh Honore, NASM-certified personal trainer and coach at Row House. \\u201cIf you\\u2019re having a good time doing this [tracking], all roads lead to success.\\u201d\\nThat said, the best fitness tracker for you may look different than the ideal option for someone else. There were baseline requirements I considered before deciding whether a fitness tracker would make my list of winners, but I also incorporated different use cases. So even if a fitness tracker wasn\\u2019t ideal for me, I thought about who it could be best for. Here\\u2019s an in-depth look at the specific criteria I used to determine which fitness trackers are a cut above the rest:\\nHeart rate accuracy: This is the most important function of a fitness tracker. Without accurate heart rate readings, nearly every other metric (calorie burn, estimated expenditure, estimated intensity, recovery recommendations, etc.) will be off, thus rendering any activity insights useless. To test each tracker\\u2019s accuracy, I used a control: the Polar H10 Chest Strap, which is regarded as one of the most accurate heart rate monitors on the market since it measures your heart rate directly, rather than through your pulse.\\nI put each tracker through a series of workouts consisting of strength training with light cardio, and compared the tracker\\u2019s heart rate reading to the companion app and to the Polar H10. I examined and compared key heart rate stats like average heart rate, max heart rate, percentage of time spent in certain heart rate zones and estimated calorie burn. Since chest-band heart rate sensors are considered the most accurate type of heart rate tracker, I expected some variation between my control and the fitness trackers. The fitness trackers that were the closest to the Polar were the ones I rated most accurate.\\nBattery life: I tested battery life by charging each tracker to 100%, then wearing it for two full days and two nights. Some\\u2014like the Apple Watch SE, Apple Watch Series 9 and Samsung\\u2019s Watch6\\u2014required a charge during that two-day period, while others still had plenty of battery left. At the least, each tracker needed to last the better part of a day (i.e., a full night\\u2019s rest and a workout the following day) or to have a fast-charge option available for convenience.\\nEase of use: To measure how easy each tracker was to use, I started by timing how long the initial unboxing and setup took me, taking note of any roadblocks. (The Fitbit Charge 6 was quick to set up but required a hard reset before it would sync with my phone.) Most took 5 to 10 minutes, but the true test was how easy it was to learn to use the app and watch features. If I had gotten the hang of things by the time I was wearing it at the gym\\u2014and didn\\u2019t need to look up how to sift through different activity options and start, stop and pause my workout\\u2014I deemed it easy to use.I wore each fitness tracker to bed to test how well it could monitor my sleep throughout the night.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nHealth and activity tracking: To test each watch\\u2019s health and activity tracking, I wore each tracker to sleep, to the gym and during every activity (or rest period) in between. This gave me a comprehensive view of each tracker\\u2019s capabilities and accuracy. When analyzing health tracking, I examined the types of insights each tracker provided about my sleep, cycle and stress levels, and the specificity of each. For example, some trackers provided a more in-depth look at my sleeping habits, including personalized tips on how to get better rest the next night and how my quality of rest affected my ability to recover. I also looked at how each tracker presented these insights (sleep scores, stress scores, etc.) and considered which were helpful for contextualizing the data, rather than giving me an arbitrary number with no real context as to how it affected my overall health.\\nFor activity tracking, I looked at how many activity or sport modes were available and how well each watch tracked my movement during those workouts and activities. I looked at the types of metrics recorded for different workouts (strength training, pool swim, outdoor walks, etc.), how well it did this compared to my control and whether the data provided useful insights for my current and next workout.\\nOverall fit and design: To get a feel for the overall fit of each tracker, I wore them to bed, during workouts and throughout my day to test their comfort. I considered factors like overall size, the material of the band, weight and adjustability. In some instances, like with Garmin\\u2019s Venu 3, the bulk didn\\u2019t make for a heavy-handed feel, whereas others (like the Coros) definitely felt their size. I also considered the size and design of the watch: how big or small the face was and whether it had buttons or knobs that made it easy to select different features.\\nHow To Pick A Fitness Tracker\\nIt can be challenging\\u2014and, frankly, overwhelming\\u2014to sift through all of the different fitness trackers, from smartwatches to dedicated devices. Below, I break down key factors to consider to simplify your search for the best fitness tracker for you.\\nIntended Use\\nConsider your purpose for using a fitness tracker before browsing. Some fitness trackers work better for specific types of activities, whereas others are more of an all-purpose wearable. Do you want a tracker that excels at running? Swimming? Cycling? All of the above? Or do you want one that can keep up with you at the gym and the activities in between? If you have special health concerns, or if you\\u2019re trying to conceive or are currently pregnant, you\\u2019ll want to find a more advanced tracker.I liked the bigger face of the Garmin Venu 3 because it made it easy to quickly check my heart rate ... [+] mid-workout.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nPrice\\nFitness trackers range in price from as little as $50 to $800 or more, though most options lie somewhere in the $150 to $400 range. When setting your budget, make sure to consider the most important features for you. Generally speaking, the more features a watch has (including advanced GPS tracking, in-depth training insights, ability to track race-specific paces, etc.), the higher its cost. However, most fitness trackers in the $150 to $300 range offer valuable features for the average person.\\nBattery Life\\nFitness trackers can vary significantly when it comes to battery life. Some can last up to two weeks on a full charge, while others can\\u2019t make it through a full 24 hours. Think about how you plan on using your tracker; if you\\u2019re looking to take it along for a backpacking trip or ultramarathon, you\\u2019ll need one with a robust battery. Some fitness trackers also come with a fast-charge option, which is a nice compromise for those who don\\u2019t necessarily need a two-week battery life but also don\\u2019t want to be glued to an outlet.\\nDesign\\nYou\\u2019ll get more use out of a fitness tracker that\\u2019s user-friendly, comfortable to wear and nice to look at. Consider your own comfort and style preferences and the overall purpose you want your tracker to serve. Endurance athletes may compromise on size and style if it means getting more advanced GPS tracking, while those looking for a casual option may prioritize aesthetics.The Fitbit Charge 6 has a thick silicone band that I found comfortable and easy to adjust.Katie Simpson For Forbes\\nAlso keep in mind the different types of materials for bands, since this will be the part of the tracker that rests on your wrist. Most come with a few options, like silicone, leather or nylon. In my experience, silicone and nylon are usually the most comfortable and easiest to adjust.\\nLastly, decide whether you want a minimalist design, like the Whoop or Oura. \\u201cA lot of my clients don\\u2019t like things on their wrist,\\u201d says Honore, who works with dancers who don\\u2019t want to be distracted by a screen. You may prefer having a screen so that you can glance down during a workout and check your progress.\\nMy Expertise\\nI\\u2019ve been an ACE-certified personal trainer for nearly two years. Throughout my own training and sessions with clients, I\\u2019ve used countless fitness trackers, which have helped me learn the most useful features to look for. I\\u2019ve also been active for as long as I can remember: I was a competitive swimmer for 13 years, and I now hike and do strength training.\\nFor this guide, I spoke with Josh Honore, NASM-certified personal trainer and California-based Row House coach, about his experience using fitness trackers, both personally and professionally. I also consulted Laura Rooney, PhD, an associate professor at Marquette University and a behavioral psychologist. We discussed the psychological and physiological effects of fitness trackers and how they can be best used by different groups of people, including those new to exercise and people with chronic health conditions, among others.\\nWhen deciding which trackers to test, I considered key features that experts highlighted as important for getting practical use out of a tracker, then I pored over online reviews, leveraged my own experience and tapped my network of gym friends and outdoor enthusiasts for insights. I prioritized brands known for accuracy and reliability, and I considered options for people of all fitness levels, not just athletes.\\nWhich Fitness Tracker Is Most Accurate?\\nBased on my testing, I found the Garmin Venu 3 to be the most accurate. It was extremely accurate at measuring my average heart rate, max heart rate and estimated calorie burn during workouts as compared to my control, the Polar H10 Chest Strap. It also accurately sensed which muscles I targeted during exercise.\\nWhat Are The Benefits To Using A Fitness Tracker?\\nFitness trackers are great not only for optimizing your training, but also for telling you when you should slow down and how to slow down. Honore enjoys using a fitness tracker for more than just training. \\u201cMy bedtime routine links into [mine], so I stretch for 20 minutes or so then do a guided relaxation for 5 minutes. I notice I have much more sound sleep when I do these habits, and it reduces my sleep anxiety.\\u201d\\nTrackers can also help you become more attuned to your body and training patterns, especially if you\\u2019re a beginner and unsure what different intensities and heart rate zones feel like for you. \\u201cThey can help you understand your training goals, like \\u2018This is what 80% of my heart rate max feels like, this is what Zone 2 feels like.\\u2019 And then you can train more intuitively. The biggest thing we can do for ourselves is create intuition around our stimulus,\\u201d says Honore.\\nLastly, fitness trackers can also benefit those who have health conditions by keeping close tabs on key metrics. \\u201cI work mostly in medical exercise, [which] fitness trackers have great potential with,\\u201d says Rooney. \\u201cWhen I work with cardiac rehab patients and post-cancer treatment patients, we use different forms of fitness trackers that we can share with their health and medical teams. We\\u2019ll put monitors on [them] because then we can see what\\u2019s going on with their heart rate and blood pressure during workout sessions, and then we can monitor and make sure they\\u2019re staying in good parameters.\\u201d\\nMore Tech Wearables To Shop\\n\\n\\nBest Smartwatches\\nBest Android Smartwatches\\nBest Golf Watches\\nBest Apple Watch Bands\\n\\n\\n Send me a secure\\u00a0tip.\\u00a0Katie SimpsonFollowingEditorial StandardsPrintReprints & Permissions\",\n        \"type\": \"Document\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"lc\": 1,\n      \"type\": \"constructor\",\n      \"id\": [\n        \"langchain\",\n        \"schema\",\n        \"document\",\n        \"Document\"\n      ],\n      \"kwargs\": {\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"source\": \"https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/07/15/2913085/0/en/Wearable-Devices-Unveils-Innovative-ChatGPT-Gestures-Interaction-for-Apple-Watch-Using-Mudra-Band-Enhancing-AI-Integration.html\",\n          \"title\": \"Wearable Devices Unveils Innovative ChatGPT Gestures\",\n          \"description\": \"- The new user experience enables interaction with AI agents through touchless gestures, offering a seamless and innovative way to engage with AI...\",\n          \"language\": \"en\"\n        },\n        \"page_content\": \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWearable Devices Unveils Innovative ChatGPT Gestures\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccessibility: Skip TopNav\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWearable Devices Unveils Innovative ChatGPT Gestures Interaction for Apple Watch Using Mudra Band, Enhancing AI Integration\\n\\n\\n\\nJuly 15, 2024 09:00 ET\\n\\n\\r\\n            | Source:\\r\\n            \\nWearable Devices Ltd.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWearable Devices Ltd.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n- The new user experience enables interaction with AI agents through touchless gestures, offering a seamless and innovative way to engage with AI technology - YOKNEAM ILLIT, ISRAEL, July  15, 2024  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Wearable Devices Ltd.

Photo: Samsung>Shanghai resident and long-time iPhone user Jiang Jiayi, 30, said he is among those mainland consumers considering to buy the Galaxy Ring.\\\"It's a lighter-weight option for health tracking, and I'm quite curious to know up to what degree it can replace smartwatches [for that purpose],\\\" he said.Samsung set the price of its smart ring on the mainland at 3,099 yuan (US$425), according to Chinese media. The company, however, labelled the gadget as \\\"out of stock\\\" on its China website as of Thursday afternoon.Some mainland consumers have already complained about the Galaxy Ring's price. \\\"It looks pretty cool,\\\" wrote Weibo user \\\"qzc\\\" in a post on the Chinese microblogging platform on Thursday.Story continues\\\"But I'll only consider [buying such a product] if any domestic company follows up [with a smart ring of its own].\\\"Before the Galaxy Ring's launch, Chinese consumers have shown interest in smart rings from some smaller vendors such as Oura, Ultrahuman and RingConn.A sustained local demand for the Galaxy Ring would count as a success for Samsung on the mainland, where it once was the biggest smartphone vendor with a 20 per cent market share in 2013.The Korean firm ranked dead last among the market's major handset vendors by 2018, with just a 1 per cent share, and has since remained around that level.Samsung Electronics launched its latest portfolio of smart wearable devices on July 10. These include the Galaxy Ring in three colour options, the Galaxy Watch7 (centre) and the Galaxy Watch Ultra.

Photo: Samsung>In spite of its shrunken presence in China, Samsung has continued to launch new smartphone models on the mainland, as it remains keen to stage a comeback.Samsung has been working with some Chinese Big Tech companies, including Baidu and Tencent Holdings, to help step up localisation of its smartphones' content ecosystem.Samsung's latest product launch is expected to help \\\"foster consumer habits\\\" in the nascent smart ring market, with the potential to widen market penetration, according to a research note by TF Securities on Wednesday.Still, it remains to be seen whether the Galaxy Ring can establish a leading position in its category or be surpassed by the competition.Apple has accelerated the development of its own smart ring and registered patents related to this device, according to a report by Korean media ETNews in February. Apple has yet to make an announcement on this new wearables segment.Chinese smartphone vendor Honor, a Huawei spin-off, also revealed in February that it was developing a smart ring after Samsung announced initial details about the Galaxy Ring during the MWC Barcelona trade show that same month.This article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

That data is then analyzed using Samsung's proprietary AI and algorithms to provide users with a new Energy Score, which details the personalized insights of the user's overall well-being.Biofeedback and stress management: One of the standout features of the Galaxy Ring is the capabilities for real-time biofeedback, which rivals similar tech products from Apple. Using sensors embedded within the ring, it can detect stress levels and provide users with actionable insights and guided breathing exercises to help manage stress effectively.Sleep tracking: Building on Samsung's expertise in sleep tracking, the Galaxy Ring offers detailed sleep analysis including stages of sleep -- REM, deep, light -- with insights to improve sleep quality over time.Fitness and activity tracking: Whether you're into running, cycling or yoga, the Galaxy Ring can track various activities with precision. It will provide users with real-time stats during their workouts as well as summaries afterward to help the user stay motivated and achieve more fitness goals.Integration with Samsung Health ecosystem: The device can sync seamlessly with the Samsung Health app, allowing users to view all their health and fitness data in one place. This integration also enables users to set goals, track progress and receive personalized recommendations based on their activity and health metrics.AT&T is the exclusive wireless carrier for the new Samsung Galaxy Ring, and the company's SVP of Consumer Product, Erin Scarborough, said this gives health-focused customers \\\"a new device that creates the perfect ecosystem with their smartphone.\\\"The new smart watches and ring will utilize AT&T's 5G technology which the company said will help ensure faster data transfer speeds, allowing for more data-intensive applications and real-time communication.Comparing the Samsung Galaxy Ring with the Oura RingAn attendee films Samsung Electronics' Galaxy Smart Ring during its unveiling ceremony, July 8, 2024, in Seoul, South Korea.Kim Hong-ji/ReutersNow, let's look at how the Samsung Galaxy Ring stacks up against the Oura Ring from Oura Health, which has multiple versions, when it comes to price and basic functionality.Materials and colors: The Galaxy Ring is made with Grade 5 Titanium and comes in three finishes: Titanium Black, Titanium Silver and Titanium Gold.The Oura Ring is made of aerospace-grade Titanium and comes in two styles. The first is Horizon, \\\"a sleek, circular design\\\" that has six finish options including Brushed Titanium, Silver, Black, Stealth, Gold or Rose Gold. The Heritage, which is Oura Health's \\\"classic, plateau design,\\\" comes in Silver, Black, Stealth or Gold finishes.Price: The Samsung Galaxy Ring is positioned competitively in the market with a starting price of $399.99, reflecting its advanced features and integration capabilities.The Oura Ring starts at $299 for the Heritage style and $349 for the Horizon style. But one key difference is that the Oura Ring requires an additional membership, which is free for the first month then increases to $5.99 per month.Water resistance: With 10ATM water resistance for both devices, meaning it's safe up to 100 meters deep, the Galaxy Ring and Oura Ring are suitable for showering, surface swimming or snorkeling, but not for greater depths like scuba diving.Size and weight: The Galaxy Ring has nine sizing options. The device is 7 mm wide and 2.6 mm thick and weighs between 2.3 grams and 3 grams, depending on the band size.

Nonetheless, current material forming technologies face challenges due to internal stress and defects, resulting in a substantial decline in both mechanical properties and processing precision. We herein develop a processing strategy toward graphene superstructure with a curvature gradient, which allows us to fabricate robust structural materials with meticulously designed functional shapes. The structure consists of an arc-shaped assembly of graphene nanosheets positioned at co-axial curvature centers. During the dehydration-based evaporate-casting process, the assembly is tightened via capillary effect, inducing local bending. By precisely tuning the axis-center distance and tilt angle, we achieve accurate control over the shape of obtained structure. Notably, internal stress is harnessed to reinforce a designed mortise and tenon structure, resulting in a high joining strength of up to ~200\\u2009MPa. This innovative approach addresses the challenges faced by current material forming technologies and opens up more possibilities for the manufacturing of robust and precisely shaped components. Through precise adjustments to the curvature gradient inherent in stacked graphene assembly walls, a highly controllable water casting process for self-shaping with an accuracy of ca. 10\\u2009\\u03bcm is demonstrated for making shaped functional materials.\",\n          \"language\": \"en\"\n        },\n        \"page_content\": \"\\n\\n\\nEvaporate-casting of curvature gradient graphene superstructures for ultra-high strength structural materials | Nature Communications\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSkip to main content\\n\\n\\nThank you for visiting nature.com.

Nonetheless, current material forming technologies face challenges due to internal stress and defects, resulting in a substantial decline in both mechanical properties and processing precision. We herein develop a processing strategy toward graphene superstructure with a curvature gradient, which allows us to fabricate robust structural materials with meticulously designed functional shapes. The structure consists of an arc-shaped assembly of graphene nanosheets positioned at co-axial curvature centers. During the dehydration-based evaporate-casting process, the assembly is tightened via capillary effect, inducing local bending. By precisely tuning the axis-center distance and tilt angle, we achieve accurate control over the shape of obtained structure. Notably, internal stress is harnessed to reinforce a designed mortise and tenon structure, resulting in a high joining strength of up to ~200\\u2009MPa. This innovative approach addresses the challenges faced by current material forming technologies and opens up more possibilities for the manufacturing of robust and precisely shaped components.\\n\\n\\n\\nSimilar content being viewed by others\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUltrathin damage-tolerant flexible metal interconnects reinforced by in-situ graphene synthesis\\n                                        \\n\\n\\nArticle\\nOpen access\\n08 March 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nContinuous crystalline graphene papers with gigapascal strength by intercalation modulated plasticization\\n                                        \\n\\n\\nArticle\\nOpen access\\n27 May 2020\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdditive manufacturing of micro-architected metals via hydrogel infusion\\n                                        \\n\\n\\nArticle\\n20 October 2022\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIntroductionStructural material processing plays crucial roles in virtually all aspects of modern manufacturing and industry, enabling the fabrication of customized, complex, and precision parts that are durable and well-suited for various applications, spanning from electronics to aerospace and automotive industries1,2,3. However, current material forming technologies suffer from internal stress or defects arising from the relative displacement of material molecules (or atoms) during the processing, which lead to a noteworthy attenuation of the intrinsic mechanical properties and a deterioration of processing precision4,5,6. In line with the development of two-dimensional materials over the past decades, microstructures constructed from graphene and its derivatives as basic building blocks have showcased tremendous potential, demonstrating that the bottom-up self-assembly is an effective strategy to address the processing challenge7,8. Through the deliberate regulation of interactions between graphene sheets, such as \\u03c0-\\u03c0 interaction and hydrogen bonding, one can achieve designed structures encompassing porous structure (Fig.\\u00a01a-i)9,10, layered structure (Fig.\\u00a01a-ii)11,12, or array structure (Fig.\\u00a01a-iii)13,14. To alter the assembly\\u2019s configuration and attain desired structural materials, an external force is necessary, while the resulting internal stress can be dissipated by relative slip between sheets. Nevertheless, random interlayer slippage of nanosheets in the above three assemblies will lead to unpredictable changes, and thus defects, in the resultant structure.Fig. 1: Conceptual illustrations of evaporate-casting of cg-G.a Graphene platelet derived from monolayer graphene nanosheets as basic building block for graphene-based functional architectures shown in i to iv: (i) porous structure, (ii) layered structure, (iii) array structure, and (iv) curvature gradient superstructure.

The two layers deem to be one curvature step. d Dehydration and evaporate-casting process of cg-G. The assembly is tightened by capillary action during water evaporating, and the curvature exhibits a gradient change, resulting in local bending driven by internal configurational force.Full size imageThe gradient structures are introduced as a groundbreaking conceptual design, demonstrating that despite relatively low precision, the internal stress inherent in material forming can still be effectively harnessed to regulate the shapes of the resulting products. Owing to the well-organized structure along the gradient direction, including the gradient of functional groups (known as chemical gradient)15 and gradient of pores (i.e., physical gradient)16, stress generated during material forming induces differential deformation at various positions within the material, achieving the shaping. Although the gradient structures are innovative in dissipating internal stress for high robustness, it still constitutes an emerging technology, presenting challenges in utilizing internal stress as a driving force for shaping process.We demonstrate here the fabrication of a graphene superstructure with curvature gradient (cg-G), and present a processing strategy to construct strong structural material with designed functional shapes. The structure comprises a circular arc-shaped assembly of graphene nanosheets positioned at co-axial curvature centers (Fig.\\u00a01a-iv). Our inspiration draws from the curvature junctions observed within the layered cells of a bean pod (Fig.\\u00a01b)17,18,19. The curvature arises as a result of the asymmetrical shrinkage of two layers during the dehydration process, ultimately inducing internal stresses that enhance the structural strength of the entire assembly while also driving deformation (Fig.\\u00a01c)20,21. Water molecules act as molecular-level plasticizers, engaging with the oxygen-containing functional groups on the graphene nanosheets through hydrogen bonding, thus imparting mobility to the graphene nanosheets. The assembly is tightened by capillary action during the dehydration-based evaporate-casting process, and the curvature also exhibits a gradient change, consequently inducing local bending driven by internal stress (Fig.\\u00a01d). Through controllable coordination of axis-center distance and tilt angle, we can exert accurate control over the shape of the resulting casting. Remarkably, in designed mortise and tenon structure, internal stress can be leveraged to reinforce the formation, leading to the attainment of a super high-strength connection (~200\\u2009MPa) upon a specific strength of 143\\u2009MPa\\u2009cm3\\u2009g\\u22121, surpassing that of metallic welding connection, or even integrally formed alloys. The entire process is characterized by its high level of controllability, feasibility, cost-effectiveness, versatility, and environmentally friendly attributes.ResultsFabrication and characterization of cg-G\\ncg-G is produced through an alkaline-assisted hydrothermal synthesis using graphene oxide (GO) as precursor (see Methods for details, Supplementary Figs.\\u00a01 and 2). The graphene walls are aligned around the geometric axis, which concurrently serves as the axis of curvature of the obtained structure. Using laser processing technology, one can shape the materials with exceptional precision, achieving accuracy of ca. 10 micrometers when combined with an evaporate-casting process (Fig.\\u00a02a and Supplementary Fig.\\u00a03). The resultant superstructure is featured with a curvature gradient (Fig.\\u00a02b), where the curvature is smaller further from the curvature center and increases as one approaches the center. The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) investigations demonstrate that the structure at point a (farther from the curvature center) shows a nearly align parallel to the central axis of curvature (Fig.\\u00a02c), while the one at point b (near to the curvature center) exhibits neat remarkable curved arrays toward the concentric axis. The side view cross-section at point c (parallel to the curvature central axis) shows a similar parallel structure to the one at point a (Fig.\\u00a02d).Fig. 2: Morphology and structure characterizations of cg-G.a Photograph of a cuboid-shaped cg-G. b Schematic structure of cg-G.

Source data are provided as a source data file.Full size imageIn a swelling state, the gaps amidst the walls become saturated with water molecules. The evaporate-casting process generates capillary forces through water evaporation, drawing the flat graphene assembly and yielding the protruding structures (Fig.\\u00a02e, Supplementary Figs.\\u00a04 and 5). Analysis via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates an oxygen composition of approximately 20% within the cg-G, affirming the presence of hydrophilic oxygen functional groups (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a06a). This observation emphasizes a robust interaction between water and the internal surfaces, thereby ensuring the potency of the capillary forces. Both Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy before and after water evaporation indicate that the casting process does not alter the composition or content of functional groups on graphene sheets (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a06b, d, e). Additionally, X-ray diffraction patterns demonstrate no discernible peak shift between the dehydrated and hydrated states (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a06c), signifying a consistent interlayer structure connecting the two graphene nanosheets within the assemblies. This suggests that the protruding structures retain the intrinsic mechanical attributes of the graphene assembly. Upon complete dehydration, an aligned microstructure is observed under scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), wherein the protrusions are mechanically interlocked in a serrated configuration (Fig.\\u00a02f, Supplementary Fig.\\u00a07). Due to this distinctive structure, cg-G after deformation demonstrates a density of ~1.5\\u2009g\\u2009cm\\u22123 and high compressive strength of up to 70\\u2009MPa/(g/cm3), surpassing that of various metals including stainless steel (SUS304) and doubling the strength of traditional graphene-based structural materials (Fig.\\u00a02g, Supplementary Fig.\\u00a08).Controllable shaping based on curvature gradientTo achieve precise control over curvature gradients, we utilized the distance (d) extending from the geometric center (O) of the samples to the curvature axis of the superstructure (O\\u2019) as a governing parameter (Fig.\\u00a03a, 3b-i). In situations where the curvature axis of the graphene superstructure is perpendicular to the plane of the cross-shaped samples, variations in the distribution of curvature gradients within the sample result in diverse bending behaviors during the evaporate-casting process (Fig.\\u00a03b-ii and 3b-iii, Supplementary Figs.\\u00a09 and 10, Supplementary Video\\u00a01). The deformation of samples with diverse curvature gradients can be anticipated via computational prediction (see Methods for details). While the level of shrinkage is notably high, the overall form of the cross-shaped samples is upheld when d\\u2009=\\u20090. This phenomenon arises due to the counteraction of configurational forces in these sections, which is a consequence of the symmetric microstructures aligning along the in-plane direction. In contrast, the prominence of the differential distribution of the shrinkage coefficient amplifies as d increases (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a011). In this context, the degree of shrinkage escalates alongside a more substantial curvature gradient. As a result, these cross-shaped cg-Gs exhibit in-plane deformations toward the curvature center direction following the process of evaporate-casting.Fig. 3: In-plane and out-plane evaporate-casting processing of cg-G.a\\u2013c In-plane processing. a Schematic diagrams of cross-shaped cg-G with an axis-center distance (d) perpendicular to centric axis of curvature. b Demonstrations of cross-shaped cg-Gs with different microstructures before and after deformation: (i) Schematic diagrams of three cross-shaped cg-G with different d values (d\\u2009=\\u20090, 3, 7\\u2009mm) on in-plane direction. (ii) Gradient distribution of the curvatures and theoretical predictions of the deformation of the three cg-Gs based on finite element analysis (FEA). (iii) SEM images of the three deformed cg-Gs.

(ii) Corresponding gradient distribution of the curvatures and theoretical predictions of the deformation of the three cg-Gs based on FEA. (iii) SEM images of the three deformed cg-Gs.

Source data are provided as a source data file.Full size imageThe microscopic observation via SEM (Fig.\\u00a03b-iii) experimentally validated the correlation between deflection and curvature gradient. Samples with a carefully designed curvature gradient exhibited corresponding bending angles (\\u03b1e) along the longer sides (the long side of the initial cross-shaped cg-G) that aligned with the values derived from computational predictions (\\u03b1c) (Fig.\\u00a03b-ii, Supplementary Fig.\\u00a09b). This alignment suggests a high level of uniformity in the self-deformation facilitated by the curvature gradient. The lateral dimension, which signifies the extent of the long side of the initial cross-shaped cg-G after deformation, is utilized to exemplify the pronounced regularity of self-deformation. Notably, despite the progressive augmentation in the curvature gradient, the lateral length remains invariant (Fig.\\u00a03c). The alterations in shape along the horizontal direction are relies on the decreasing gap width of the wall structures. As a result, the constant lateral dimension not only denotes a consistent curvature gradient but also a contraction that closely approximates the characteristics of an ideal coaxial circular arc model (see Supplementary Fig.\\u00a012 for details), which concurs with the structural characterization elucidated in Fig.\\u00a02. More examples of the in-plane deformation are shown in Supplementary Figs.\\u00a013 and 14.We also examined a scenario where the axis of curvature is parallel to the plane of the cross-shape specimen, and we denoted the distance between the geometric center point and the curvature axis as d (Fig.\\u00a03d, 3e-i). The deformation induced by the evaporate-casting process was simulated computationally (Fig.\\u00a03e-ii, Supplementary Fig.\\u00a015a). Despite the significant contraction (high shrinkage coefficient level), the fundamental configuration of the cross-shaped samples remains unaltered when d\\u2009=\\u20090. This phenomenon can be ascribed to the equilibrium between internal stresses within symmetric microstructures. The distribution of the shrinkage coefficient becomes more pronounced as the curvature gradient increases (Fig.\\u00a03e-iii), signifying that the relationship between the degree of out-plane bending and curvature gradient mirrors that of in-plane deformation. Additionally, a distinct out-plane deformation becomes evident, aligning with the computational predictions. The independence of the lateral length on the curvature gradient underscores the nearly ideal arrangement of co-axial circular arc-shaped graphene assemblies, reinforcing the concordance between observations and expectations (Fig.\\u00a03f, Supplementary Fig.\\u00a015b). The consistency of these phenomena with the results of in-plane deformation experiments highlights satisfactory controllability facilitated by the curvature gradient in self-shaping processes.Mechanism of self-shapingThe evaporate-casting enabled self-shaping relies on the hierarchical deformation of graphene walls. Water molecules serve as plasticizers, enabling relative sliding of graphene nanosheets within the walls. In this context, as water within surface wrinkles evaporates, capillary forces prompt each graphene nanosheet to crumple (Fig.\\u00a04a). Consequently, protrusions emerge on the dehydrated wall surfaces (Fig.\\u00a02e, f), causing shrinkage along the plane of the wall. It\\u2019s worth noting that due to robust \\u03c0-\\u03c0 interaction forces between graphene sheets, the crumpled walls retain their form even when in contact with water. On an assembly scale, capillary forces exert a tautening effect on the wall structures, diminishing gap sizes and hence yielding a compact arrangement (Fig.\\u00a04b). The emergence of protrusions and the constriction of wall structures collectively bring about macroscopic shape contraction in orthogonal directions. This behavior can be reflected on a cuboid sample comprising a centrosymmetric curvature gradient microstructure (Fig.\\u00a04c, Supplementary Figs.\\u00a016 and 17). The ratio of contraction along the wall plane (l\\u2019) compared to that perpendicular to the wall plane (w\\u2019) was measured at 1.4, indicating the anisotropic contraction behavior that could significantly bolster the efficacy of the curvature gradient induced deformation. This casting method demonstrates high stability. The ratio of l\\u2019/w\\u2019 is determined by the microstructure of cg-G (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a018), and remains unaffected by the surrounding environment during water evaporation (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a019).Fig. 4: Mechanism of evaporate-casting of cg-G.a Schematic of capillary force (Pc) of water in the groove of a monolayer graphene sheet, and the deformation of graphene groove after dehydration. The capillary force acts perpendicular to the water surface and can be divided into two force modes: one is normal to the graphene sheet (Fx) and the other is along the sheet (Fy). b Schematic of the dehydration process of graphene walls arrayed in parallel during evaporate-casting. c Photographs of cuboid-shaped cg-G comprising a centrosymmetric curvature gradient structure after dehydration of 0\\u2009h and 5\\u2009h, and the corresponding SEM image of dehydration for 5\\u2009h.

After being twisted, the direction towards the curvature center (blue arrow) shifts from in-plane to out-plane. h Digital photos and SEM images of three cg-G assemblies with a twisted angle of 0o (i), 10o (ii), and 30o (iii) before and after evaporate-casting.Full size imageThen we delve into how the self-tightening effect of cg-Gs during the evaporate-casting process is harnessed to programmatically transform simple profiles into intricate structures. According to the Kelvin curvature effect22, water molecules are more likely to escape from curved surfaces. This observation aligns with our experimental findings that water evaporates more rapidly from the side with larger curvature. With water evaporating, moisture near highly curved graphene sheets becomes depleted first, leading to more pronounced deformations compared to regions with lower curvature. Considering these mechanisms, we can postulate the following relationship between radial strain (\\u03b5r, strain towards the center of the curvature) and curvature radius (\\u03c1) of cg-G during evaporate-casting:$${\\\\varepsilon }_{r}={\\\\varepsilon }_{0}+{bf}(\\\\rho )({\\\\varepsilon }_{r}\\\\, < \\\\, 0)$$\\n                    (1)\\n                where \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{0}\\\\) (<0) represents the uniform shrinkage strain (the curvature radius equals zero). \\\\(b\\\\) (>0) is the curvature deformation coefficient, indicating the sensitivity of deformation to changes in curvature radius. f(\\u03c1) is a function of \\u03c1, signifying that as the curvature radius increases, the shrinkage deformation decreases. In this study, when analyzing cg-G slices consists of graphene walls positioned at co-axial curvature centers (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a020), we assumed a relationship between \\u03b5r and \\u03c1, i.e., \\u03b5r\\u2009=\\u2009\\u03b50\\u2009+\\u2009b\\u03c12 (see Supplementary text for details). Specifically, the curvature microstructures of cg-G slices can be described by their d and \\u03b8 values. Based on above relationship, we investigated the deformation of cg-G with different d and \\u03b8, and provided corresponding analytical expressions (see Supplementary text for details). Theoretical results not only effectively accord with the deformation states discussed in Fig.\\u00a03, but also accurately predict deformations of dumbbell-shaped cg-Gs (see Figs. 21\\u201323 for a detailed discussion). For example, the FEA results and SEM images reveal that the dumbbell architecture (Fig. 4d,\\u00a0with a \\u03b8 value of 45\\u00b0) presents twists around the long center axis after deformation (Fig.\\u00a04e, f), resulting in a stereo and centrosymmetric final geometry, and bilateral cuboids transformed to be approximate trapezoidal cube due to the in-plane deformation. These results validate the mechanism of curvature gradient-induced bending deformation.Apart from the self-shaping cg-G structures that can be predicted and understood through having defined the relevant \\u03b8 and d parameters, this behavior can be further programmed through external force which allows the assembly to exhibit self-plastic capability like metals. To demonstrate this point, we applied two forces of equal magnitude and opposite direction on both ends of an arc-shaped cg-G (Fig.\\u00a04g), resulting in the initial twist deformations with different bending angles, such as a small angle of 10\\u00b0 (Fig.\\u00a04g-ii) and a large angle of 30\\u00b0 (Fig.\\u00a04g-iii), respectively. After deformation, the direction towards the curvature center (blue arrow) shifts from in-plane to out-plane. The coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) calculation model show that the energy of the system initially increases and then decreases as raise of twist angles because of inter-adhered graphene walls driven by strong \\u03c0\\u2013\\u03c0 interactions (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a024). As the degree of deformation intensifies, the quantity of adhering walls escalates, causing a continual reduction in the system\\u2019s energy. When the energy drops below zero, the system achieves stability, and the structure displays plasticity, enabling it to preserve the shape shaped by external forces (Fig.\\u00a04g-ii, iii).The cg-G slices can be shaped due to their distinctive curvature gradient structures through evaporate-casting. As water evaporates, all arc-shaped cg-G architectures are expected to undergo alterations in their initial profiles (Fig.\\u00a04h). The one with symmetrical curvature center structure transformed into a closed-loop structure during the evaporate-casting process (Fig.\\u00a04h-i), aligning with the previously mentioned self-shaping principles. When subjected to additional forces with initial twist angles of 10\\u00b0 (Fig.\\u00a04h-ii) and 30\\u00b0 (Fig.\\u00a04h-iii), the direction pointing towards the center of curvature changed, signifying the existence of out-of-plane components of the asymmetry within the curvature structure. The changes directly resulted further structural deformations out of plane. In SEM images, two helix-shaped cg-G architectures with the same deformation mode but different pitches can be observed, and the twist angle is larger than it before deformation. These deformations resulted from the configurational forces generated by the combined effects of the initial curvature gradient and the additional twist angle during dehydration. These results confirm the previously established deformation mechanism.Enhanced mechanical strength through hierarchical self-tighteningWe constructed a gasket structure (Fig.\\u00a05a), aligning the curvature center axis with the geometric center axis, to investigate the self-tightening effect induced by evaporate-casting across a highly symmetric curvature gradient. Impressively, when five micro-fixators were placed between two thick stainless steel plates (Fig.\\u00a05b), the assembly could withstand nearly one ton of weight as exemplified by a car (weighing ~1200\\u2009kg) running over on the top (Fig.\\u00a05c). Throughout the compression process, the gasket structure remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a025), while distinct indentations appeared on the stainless steel plate (Fig.\\u00a05d), underscoring the superior strength of the gasket structure in comparison to stainless steel. By taking virtue from self-deformation behaviors induced by curvature gradient structures, we showed that various preset architectures could be accurately constructed, such as a blooming flower-like configuration (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a026a\\u2013c). Additionally, the macroscopic-scale self-tightening is demonstrated by the mortise and tenon structure. We employed asymmetric shrinkage to craft samples featuring mortise structures (Fig.\\u00a05e). For the tenon structure, we positioned the curvature center axis at the center of the mortise circle. This arrangement enabled the tenon structure to display an inward deformation tendency during the coupling process with evaporate-casting, ultimately achieving a macroscopic self-tightening effect. Upon examining the microscopic morphology of the joint, we observed slight deformation in the shoulder part of the mortise structure (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a026d), indicating the centripetal deformation inherent in the tenon structure. A tight juncture of the mortise and tenon structures revealed by the SEM investigation further confirmed the self-locking behavior (Fig.\\u00a05f, Supplementary Fig.\\u00a026e). Remarkably, a self-tightening mortise and tenon configuration, measuring merely 1 cubic millimeter in volume, demonstrated the capacity to lift a weight weighing 300,000 times its own mass (Fig.\\u00a05g, Supplementary Video\\u00a02). Its specific tensile strength reached up to 143\\u2009MPa\\u2009cm3\\u2009g\\u22121 (Fig.\\u00a05h, Supplementary Figs.\\u00a027 and 28), comparable to welded metals23,24, and far superior to various types of connectors including self-healing polymer25,26,27, and 3D printed structures28,29,30 (Supplementary Table\\u00a01). Energy utilization can also be calculated through the thermal transfer power during the material preparation process, and the mechanically interlocked structure exhibits values that are 1 to 4 orders of magnitude higher than those of the aforementioned contrast materials (the calculation of energy utilization is detailed in Supplementary Information). Concurrently, its substantial materials and size expandability, and adaptability serve to position it as a promising, innovative, and eco-friendly technology for structural connections (Supplementary Figs.\\u00a029 and 30).Fig. 5: Mechanical strength and demonstrations of cg-Gs after evaporate-casting.a Schematic and optical images of cuboid-shaped cg-G with circular void in the middle after evaporate-casting.

Source data are provided as a source data file.Full size imageThe evaporate-casting of curvature gradient graphene superstructures presented herein allow for the controllable fabrication of graphene micro-architectures with diverse designed functional shapes and high mechanical strength. With the controllable design of uniform arc-shaped assembly of graphene nanosheets positioned at co-axial curvature centers, configurational force pointed to the center of curvature generated during dehydration. As a result, the assembly is tightened during the dehydration-based evaporate-casting process via capillary force, inducing local bending. Through precisely tuning the axis-center distance and tilt angle, we realized accurate control over the shape of obtained evaporate-casting structure. In addition, mortise and tenon structure is induced to this work and the internal stress can be leveraged to reinforce the formation, leading to a high-strength connection (~200\\u2009MPa), surpassing that of multiple materials with connection structures, and even welded metals. Compared with traditional welding technology, the proposed evaporate-casting processing can occur spontaneously at room temperature, greatly reduced the threshold and energy consumption of the combination reaction. The entire process is characterized by its high level of controllability, feasibility, cost-effectiveness, versatility, and environmentally friendly attributes.MethodsPreparation of the GO dispersionGO was prepared via the modified Hummers method31. Firstly, 10\\u2009g of graphite powder (mesh number: 200) and sodium nitrate (3\\u2009g) were added into a beaker (3\\u2009L) containing 260\\u2009mL of concentrated sulfur acid (98%), and stirred at 0\\u2009\\u00b0C for 2\\u2009h. Then, 30\\u2009g of potassium permanganate was carefully added under stirring, keep for 2\\u2009h. After that, the beaker was transferred to a constant temperature water bath of 35\\u2009\\u00b0C and kept for stirring for 1\\u2009h. Thereafter, 460\\u2009mL of cold deionized water was dropwise added into the mixture and kept at 98\\u2009\\u00b0C for 30\\u2009min. Additional 1\\u2009L of cold deionized water and 20\\u2009mL of hydrogen peroxide were poured into the solution. Finally, the product was centrifuged and washed by deionized water repeatedly until the pH changed from acidity to neutral, then the GO dispersion was produced.Fabrication of random graphene assemblyWe prepared graphene hydrogel with random structure through hydrothermal process with GO as precursor. Specially, 60\\u2009ml GO aqueous (3.5\\u2009mg\\u2009mL\\u22121) dispersion was added into a 100\\u2009ml Teflon-lined autoclave, and treated by a hydrothermal process (180\\u2009\\u00b0C for 6\\u2009h) in air oven, resulting in a normal cylindrical graphene hydrogel with random microstructures.Fabrication of cg-G\\n60\\u2009ml GO aqueous dispersion (3.5\\u2009mg\\u2009mL\\u22121) was added into a 100\\u2009ml Teflon-lined autoclave and add certain amount of alkali (e.g., ammonium hydroxide (the volume ratio of GO aqueous dispersion to ammonium hydroxide (concentration: 32%) is 60:1), potassium hydroxide (0.15\\u2009mol\\u2009L\\u22121)) under stirring. Keep stirring for 5\\u2009min and then treated by a hydrothermal process (180\\u2009\\u00b0C for 6\\u2009h) in air oven, resulting in a cylindrical graphene hydrogel with ordered concentric circle microstructures. Subsequently, the prepared hydrogel was immersed in 1\\u2009M HCl solution for 6\\u20138\\u2009h. After thoroughly rinsing to eliminate any lingering acid, the pure cg-G was obtained.After adding alkali, GO sheets could transform from disorder state into long-range oriented lamellar phases. Benefiting from the reaction between alkali and carboxyl on GO sheets, the hydrogen bond interaction between GO sheets decreased distinctly and electrostatic repulsion increased (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a01). Under following stirring process, GO sheets tuned their direction vector in real time and maintained an overall trend of parallel to each other. The outline of fabricated hydrogel is determined by the inner surface of reaction still because of the surface anchoring effect, as well as the aligned arrangement of GO sheets. Changing the lining shape of Teflon-lined autoclave, graphene assemblies with different geometry were prepared because of the surface anchoring effect, as well as the aligned arrangement of GO sheets. By adjusting the concentration of GO aqueous dispersion (1.5\\u2009mg\\u2009mL\\u22121, 2.5\\u2009mg\\u2009mL\\u22121, 3.5\\u2009mg\\u2009mL\\u22121, 4\\u2009mg\\u2009mL\\u22121) and varying the quantity of alkali used, graphene hydrogels with different structures can be prepared (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a02).cg-Gs were fabricated via sculpturing graphene hydrogel with concentric circle microstructures by an ultraviolet laser cutting system (LAJAMIN 3D laser) conducted by computer operation system. By adjusting both the axis-center distance (d) and the tilt angle (\\\\(\\\\theta\\\\): angle between the center axis of initial cylinder profile and the normal axis of target profile, changing from 0\\u00b0 to 90\\u00b0), a diverse range of cg-G can be fabricated.Fabrication of complex cg-G\\nFirst, arc-shaped cg-G is fabricated via sculpturing graphene hydrogel with concentric circle microstructures (\\u03b8\\u2009=\\u20090\\u00b0) by laser cutting system. Then, through the manipulation of one end of the arc structure while twisting the opposite end, external forces of equal magnitude but opposing directions can be simultaneously exerted at precise points on the target structure. By adjusting the twisting angle of the target structure, various complex cg-Gs can be created.Fabrication of cg-G architectures via evaporating-casting processPut as-prepared cg-G slices on a Teflon substrate with glazed surface. The surface of Teflon is super-hydrophobic, which can decrease the influence from the detect between substrate and hydrogel furthest. Standing the hydrogel in ambient atmosphere or convection oven (35\\u2009\\u00b0C\\u221265\\u2009\\u00b0C) for a certain time, and cg-G architectures could be prepared via shrinking and deforming spontaneously.CharacterizationThe morphologies of the samples were investigated using a scanning electron microscope (SEM, SU-8010). HADDF-STEM images were obtained by FEI TecnaiTF20 transmission electron microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was conducted on ULVAC-PHI PHI Quantro SXM X-ray photoelectron spectrometer. X-ray diffraction pattern was conducted on SmartLab multiple crystal X-ray spectrometer. Mechanical tests were carried out using a Shimadzu AGS-X. Optical images were acquired on ZEISS Axio Scope. The graphene hydrogel assembly was sculptured by a 355\\u2009nm ultraviolet laser cutting system (Beijing Lagamin Laser Co., LM-UVY-5S-Y) under ambient conditions.Finite element analysis (FEA)Due to the varying distances from the center, the curvature and the degree of contraction of the material differ at different locations. Considering the known micro-mechanisms, we have set up the following strain field in FEA, \\\\(\\\\varepsilon (x,\\\\, {y},\\\\, {z})={\\\\varepsilon }_{0}+b({x}^{2}\\\\,+{y}^{2})={\\\\varepsilon }_{0}+{{br}}^{2}\\\\), \\\\(\\\\varepsilon=0\\\\) at the outermost region. Among them, \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{0} \\\\, < \\\\, 0\\\\) represents the strain at the center, and \\\\(b \\\\, > \\\\, 0\\\\) the curvature deformation coefficient. The contraction deformation is maximum at the center. As moving toward the outer regions, the degree of contraction gradually decreases. It is worth noting that graphene is distributed in a ring shape within the x-y plane in the specimen, while it is approximately uniformly distributed along the z-direction. Therefore, uniform loading in the z-direction is set to reflect this characteristic. It is also noted that the change in water evaporation rate during the deformation of graphene hydrogels. Thus, the set strain rate decreases as the deformation increases.All of the above-introduced deformation fields are achieved through an equivalent temperature field and implemented within the finite element solver ABAQUS by using the user subroutine to define incremental strains. The overall finite element model was meshed with 8-node brick (C3D8) elements.Coarse grain molecular dynamics (MD) simulationCoarse grain molecular dynamics (MD) simulation is performed to uncover the deformation mechanism during shrinking process. In all models, each graphene sheet or platelet is depicted by coarse grain particles, which compose a square or rectangle sheet. According to Ref. [Steven Cranford], the total energy of graphene sheets or platelets could be written as$${\\\\phi }_{{tot}}={\\\\phi }_{T}+{\\\\phi }_{\\\\varphi }+{\\\\phi }_{\\\\theta }+{\\\\phi }_{{ad},{gp}}+{\\\\phi }_{{ad},{wp}}$$\\n                    (2.1)\\n                where the first three terms are harmonic potentials given by$${\\\\phi }_{T}=\\\\frac{1}{2}{K}_{T}(r-{{r}_{0}}){\\\\,\\\\!}^{2},\\\\, {\\\\phi }_{\\\\varphi }=\\\\frac{1}{2}{K}_{\\\\varphi }{(\\\\varphi -{\\\\varphi }_{0})}^{2},\\\\, {\\\\phi }_{\\\\theta }=\\\\frac{1}{2}{K}_{\\\\theta }{(\\\\theta -{\\\\theta }_{0})}^{2}$$\\n                    (2.2)\\n                where \\\\({K}_{T}\\\\,=\\\\,1000\\\\), \\\\({K}_{\\\\varphi }\\\\,=\\\\,0.1\\\\) and \\\\({K}_{\\\\theta }\\\\,=\\\\,0.1\\\\). The equilibrium distance and angles are \\\\({r}_{0}\\\\,=\\\\,1\\\\), \\\\({\\\\varphi }_{0}={180}^{\\\\circ }\\\\) and \\\\({\\\\theta }_{0}={90}^{\\\\circ }\\\\). Note that here the Lennard-Jones unit system are applied. Lennard-Jones potential is used to describe the adhesion interaction between graphene particles,$${\\\\phi }_{{ad},{gp}}={4\\\\varepsilon }_{{ad},{gp}}\\\\left[{\\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{gp}}}{r}\\\\right)}^{12}-{\\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{gp}}}{r}\\\\right)}^{6}\\\\right]$$\\n                    (2.3)\\n                Where \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{{ad},{gp}}=1\\\\), and \\\\({\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{gp}}{{\\\\mbox{=}}}\\\\,0.89\\\\). The adhesion interaction between graphene particles and water particles,$${\\\\phi }_{{ad},{wp}}={4\\\\varepsilon }_{{ad},{wp}}\\\\left[{\\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{wp}}}{r}\\\\right)}^{12}-{\\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{wp}}}{r}\\\\right)}^{6}\\\\right]$$\\n                    (2.4)\\n                where \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{{ad},{wp}}=3\\\\), and \\\\({\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{wp}}{{\\\\mbox{=}}}0.89\\\\). Besides, LJ potential is also used to depict the interaction between water particles$${\\\\phi }_{{ad},{wp}}={4\\\\varepsilon }_{{wp}}\\\\left[{\\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\sigma }_{{wp}}}{r}\\\\right)}^{12}-{\\\\left(\\\\frac{{\\\\sigma }_{{wp}}}{r}\\\\right)}^{6}\\\\right]$$\\n                    (2.5)\\n                where \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{{wp}}=1\\\\), and \\\\({\\\\sigma }_{{wp}}=0.955\\\\). The periodic boundary condition is adopted. To simulate the shrink process, the simulation box size is gradually reduced with water particles decreasing accordingly.In some calculation models, parameters are changed due to the simulation scenario and scale difference. To be specific, the calculation model in Supplementary Fig.\\u00a024 does not include water particles, and the parameters \\\\({K}_{T}=100\\\\), \\\\({K}_{\\\\varphi }=\\\\,10\\\\), \\\\({\\\\sigma }_{{ad},{gp}}\\\\,{{\\\\mbox{=}}}0.4\\\\); in the calculation model (Supplementary Fig.\\u00a05), \\\\({K}_{T}=\\\\,100\\\\), \\\\({K}_{\\\\varphi }=100\\\\), and \\\\({\\\\varepsilon }_{{ad},{wp}}{{\\\\mbox{=}}}\\\\,0.2\\\\) to keep graphene sheets stay together32,33,34.Reporting summaryFurther information on research design is available in the\\u00a0Nature Portfolio Reporting Summary linked to this article.\\n\\n\\nData availability\\nThe data generated in this study are provided in the Supplementary Information and Source Data file.\\u00a0Source data are provided with this paper.\\nCode availability\\nThe code supporting this study is available from the corresponding author upon request.\\nReferencesSchaedler, T.

We may earn a commission through links on our site. Why Trust Us?IF YOU'RE an advanced runner, you're probably no stranger to pushing limits. But have you considered taking your training to the next level? If so, it might be time to add a curved treadmill to your training repertoire. Imagine a cardio machine that challenges your physical limits and can also reduce your risk of injury. That's right\\u2014a curved treadmill offers a more natural gait that can result in shorter stride length.  According to research, a decreased stride length results in less impact, meaning your joints will take less of a beating. They're non-motorized and can be placed anywhere without requiring a power outlet, making curved treadmills an easy addition to virtually any home gym setup. You can walk, jog, or run on curved treadmills, just like you can on any standard machine. But because there's no motor, the user's movement powers the treadmill, resulting in up to 30% more calories burned compared to a motorized treadmill.Best Commercial Grade Curved TreadmillHammer Strength HD TreadRead moreBest Value Curved TreadmillAssault Fitness AssaultRunner ProRead moreBest Curved Treadmill for SprintingTrueForm Runner Curved TreadmillRead moreThese machines offer a dynamic, advanced way to do sprint and interval training indoors. \\\"The curved tread is ideal for anyone who wants to learn to build speed and acceleration without hitting the track,\\\" says our Fitness Director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S. \\\"You\\u2019ll also get much better hamstring engagement on a curved tread than on a standard tread.\\\"So if you're ready to take on a new challenge, it's time to give a curved treadmill a try. With a little practice, you\\u2019ll be running like a pro in no time.

It was originally built for commercial gyms, so you can trust it's made to last. The treadmill has an adjustable resistance level which allows you to customize the intensity of the workout, making it ideal for experienced athletes in need of an extra challenge. It also comes with a built-in, easy to use console that displays key workout metrics such as speed, distance, and calories burned.

We find the TrueForm to better simulate road running, but many actually prefer the Assault Air Runner. Having been used in the CrossFit Games multiple times, the Assault Air Runner is non-motorized with a thick rubber belt that feels very comfortable in comparison to the ones often seen on traditional treadmills.All in all, the Air Runner is one of the best values in the category currently available.What do buyers say? \\\"If you are seriously considering, stop waiting, and just buy it. I have had ... a couple of other treadmills, motorized of course, with screens and connected this or that, but nothing compares to this machine,\\\" said one Amazon reviewer.Read more: Most Cushioned Running ShoesDimensions (D x W x H)70 x 33 x 64 inchesItem weight280 lb.Weight capacity350 lb.Display7-inch Hi-Contrast, UV Resistant Console ScreenMax. speed20 MPHBest Curved Treadmill for SprintingTrueForm Runner Curved Treadmill$6,899 at trueformrunner.comProsNon-motorizedNo max. speed limitHefty weight capacityNearest simulation of genuine road runningCompact footprintConsExpensiveIncline/decline not adjustableThe TrueForm Runner is non-motorized, meaning the only thing powering it is you, and trust us, you\\u2019ll feel it. It features over 200 ABEC Bearings that the rubber track runs on to create a smooth, yet responsive feeling that is superior to standard treadmills. Although the TrueForm Runner is built to take a beating, it\\u2019s unique shape is actually incredibly well thought out. Rather than being flat, the curved design is there to help improve your running form by forcing you to go from heel striking to a mid-foot strike (which is a much better way to run.)And because it\\u2019s powered by you, you\\u2019ll get better hamstring and glute engagement\\u2014and you\\u2019ll be able to reach speeds that many conventional treadmills can\\u2019t, if you\\u2019re so inclined. If you want to sprint or interval-train with true intensity on a treadmill, this is the way to go, even if there is a bit of a learning, err, curve to this one.Read more: Best Workout HeadphonesDimensions (D x W x H)60 x 36 x 57 inchesItem weight325 lb.Weight capacity450 lb.Display7-inch digital screenMax. speedInfiniteAdvertisement - Continue Reading BelowMost Affordable Curved TreadmillSB Fitness Equipment CT400 Self Generated Curved Commercial Treadmill$1,895 at Amazon$1,795 at sbfitnessequipment.com$2,378 at WalmartProsGreat priceHas adjustable resistanceSpeed changes adjust quicklyLighter than other optionsConsMay not be able to outlast higher end modelsIf you're looking to level up your training with a curved treadmill at home but don't want to break the bank, this one from SB Fitness Equipment is worth considering.

Rather than just being made for running, the SKILLMILL utilizes \\u201cMultidrive Technology\\u201d that creates resistance on the free-spinning tread belt to turn the treadmill into a simulated sled push. Several companies have tried to duplicate this, but TechnoGym is absolutely producing the best version\\u2014it only takes a few minutes on the SKILLMILL to realize it\\u2019s unlike any other treadmill you\\u2019ve ever used.You can go from walking to running to feeling like you\\u2019re pushing hundreds of pounds on a track.

So the answer is maybe. Curved treadmills are non-motorized. They rely instead on you walking or running, and the belt being pushed backward manually with every foot strike on the sloped surface. While this might not seem as \\u201cfancy\\u201d or high-tech as a powered treadmill, this design has its benefits.\\\"Curved treadmills tend to recruit more muscles due to the shape of the belt and the act of propelling against it,\\\" says Eric Sung, C.S.C.S., a strength and conditioning coach based in Queens, NY. \\\"It also eases the strain of your joints because of the curvature and is often better for users with varied joint pain.\\\"By some reports, exercising on a curved treadmill burns 30% more calories over a traditional powered treadmill.\\\"One drawback of a curved treadmill is that it is difficult to achieve higher speeds (sprints) with proper technique. This can impact front side mechanics with one's stride through by 'reaching',\\\" explains Sung. Another thing to consider: because curved treads are motorless, they also don't allow for incline or decline capabilities.Read more: Curved TreadmillsTraining on a Curved TreadmillCurved treadmills are ideal for time-based workouts, where you know exactly how long you\\u2019ll be working for and can concentrate on putting in the effort.Before you dive headfirst into training on a curved treadmill, it\\u2019s important to take things slow. Which starts with finding your feet. Measure out your early efforts before attempting harder workouts, as running on a curved belt requires different mechanics than a traditional treadmill. Toggle between accelerating and holding a steady pace to get a feel for both.One of the key things to remember when training on a curved treadmill is that you\\u2019re in control. Although it may feel challenging at first, your brain will soon figure out the motion and then your body will fall into motion. You\\u2019ll need to position yourself closer to the front of the treadmill than might seem natural, allowing your foot to pull the belt back on landing. Maintain good posture, stay tall with your core engaged, and drive your arms to maintain momentum.How to Select the Best Curved Treadmill (for You)When shopping for a curved treadmill, there are several factors to consider. These include:Size and space: Make sure you have enough space to accommodate a curved treadmill. Consider the dimensions of the machine and ensure that it fits comfortably in your workout space.Price: Curved treadmills can be expensive, so determine your budget before starting your search. Keep in mind that while cheaper options are available, they may not offer the same quality and durability as higher-end models.Weight capacity: Make sure the treadmill you choose can accommodate your weight and the weight of anyone else who will be using it.Durability: Look for a machine with a sturdy construction and durable materials, as well as a good warranty, to ensure it will last.Console and metrics: Consider the built-in console and what metrics it displays, such as speed, distance, calories burned, and heart rate. Look for a console that is easy to use and customizable to your fitness goals.Brand reputation: Do some research on the brand of the curved treadmill you are interested in, and read reviews from other users to ensure that you are making a wise investment in a quality machine.Advertisement - Continue Reading BelowHow We SelectedWe consulted with Men's Health's fitness experts, editors and Director, Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., on the best curved treadmills on the market now.

The new A5, offered in saloon and Avant body configurations, features all-new styling cues and a sporty design. From the first glance, the model appears more aggressive than the previous generation. The saloon variant takes up the characteristic styling cues of a coup\\u00e9, primarily the steeply raked roofline and the tail section culminating in the body-integrated spoiler, while the tailgate evokes the brand\\u2019s Sportback variants. No less muscular is the station wagon version called Avant, as is the case for all Audis with this trim.\\nThe front is dominated by the wide single frame with three-dimensional honeycomb structure, derived from Audi Sport. The headlamps are sharp, while the marked quattro blisters at the wheel arches evoke the four-ring all-wheel drive system and are inspired by the legendary Audi Ur-four. The short overhangs and long wheelbase are matched by the clean lines at the rear, distinguished by the light band that seamlessly connects the light clusters and the rectangular exhaust tailpipes.\\nSimilarly to the Audi Q6 e-tron, the new Audi A5 adopts the second generation of Oled technology, which significantly expands the range of functions for the benefit of both individual and collective safety. The Oled rear light clusters evolve into displays: they communicate in a targeted manner with their surroundings by exploiting Car-to-X interaction and alerting other road users in advance to dangers.\\nJust like the exterior, the interior of the new A5 has also been completely redesigned. The dashboard is strongly characterised by the Audi Digital Stage, the digital stage of the four rings composed of the 11.9-inch virtual cockpit and the 14.5-inch display of the MMI system as well as the screen dedicated to the passenger. The MMI panoramic display, specifically, is characterised by its curved design and Oled technology. The curved shape \\u2018envelops\\u2019 the driver and evokes the lines of the Audi single frame, while the 10.9-inch passenger display is harmoniously integrated into the dashboard design.\\n\\n\\nBy A&D|2024-07-17T15:42:00+02:0017 July 2024|NEWS| \\nCondividi questo articolo, scegli tu dove!\\nFacebookXLinkedInWhatsAppEmail \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRelated Posts\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIAN CAMERON TRAGICALLY KILLED IN A ROBBERY\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIAN CAMERON TRAGICALLY KILLED IN A ROBBERY\\n\\n\\n15 July 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFIAT GRANDE PANDA, PRACTICALITY WITH STYLE\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFIAT GRANDE PANDA, PRACTICALITY WITH STYLE\\n\\n\\n11 July 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFORD CAPRI, THE RETURN OF A MYTH\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFORD CAPRI, THE RETURN OF A MYTH\\n\\n\\n11 July 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nALCANTARA DRESSES THE BMW XM\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nALCANTARA DRESSES THE BMW XM\\n\\n\\n10 July 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMORGAN LAUNCHES NINE SUPER 3 LIMITED EDITION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMORGAN LAUNCHES NINE SUPER 3 LIMITED EDITION\\n\\n\\n9 July 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRENAULT DISPLAYS, TOUCH REVOLUTION\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRENAULT DISPLAYS, TOUCH REVOLUTION\\n\\n\\n5 July 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNICOLAS PROUST NEW HEAD OF TATA MOTORS DESIGN STUDIO IN TURIN\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNICOLAS PROUST NEW HEAD OF TATA MOTORS DESIGN STUDIO IN TURIN\\n\\n\\n1 July 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHYUNDAI INSTER, THE POCKET ELECTRIC (VIDEO)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHYUNDAI INSTER, THE POCKET ELECTRIC (VIDEO)\\n\\n\\n27 June 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFERRARI PUROSANGUE WINS THE COMPASSO D\\u2019ORO AWARD\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFERRARI PUROSANGUE WINS THE COMPASSO D\\u2019ORO AWARD\\n\\n\\n21 June 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBMW X3, LOOKING FOR SPORTINESS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBMW X3, LOOKING FOR SPORTINESS\\n\\n\\n19 June 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBuy copy \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nREAD MORE \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBUY NOW \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBUY NOW \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tDIGITAL BACK ISSUES \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nRecent\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAUDI A5, SPORTY SOUL\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t17 July 2024\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIAN CAMERON TRAGICALLY KILLED IN A ROBBERY\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t15 July 2024\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOMODA E JAECOO, TWO FACES OF CHINESE NEW AGE\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t15 July 2024\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFIAT GRANDE PANDA, PRACTICALITY WITH STYLE\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t11 July 2024\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFORD CAPRI, THE RETURN OF A MYTH\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t11 July 2024\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCategories\\n\\nARCHIVE\\n\\nBOOKS\\n\\nCONCEPT\\n\\nDESIGN STORY\\n\\nEXTRA\\n\\nNEWS\\n\\nNEWSSTAND\\n\\nON THE ROAD\\n\\nSCHOOL / STUDENTS\\n\\nUncategorized\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAUTO & DESIGN SRL Via Pietro Egidi, 6\\n10122 Turin, Italy\\nTel. +39 011 245 24 79\\nE-mail info@autodesignmagazine.com\\n \\n\\nSubscribe to our newsletter\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                          Your registration cannot be validated.\\r\\n                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n                          Your registration was successful\\r\\n                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nE-mail\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI consent to the processing of my personal data for the marketing purposes indicated in the privacy policy (read the policy here bottom page).

They provide unparalleled views of your favorite video games and you can stick your favorite streamer or YouTuber in one corner without needing to hook in a separate monitor or compromising your visual experience.\\nAccordingly, these titans of the monitor world tend to cost a hefty price. Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi has entered the scene with a budget ultrawide monitor option that can offer benefits without the cost.Article continues after ad\\nKey specs: Xioami Curved Gaming Monitor G34WQi \\n\\nScreen size: 34-inch ultrawide\\nPanel type: VA (Curved)\\nResolution: 3440\\u00d71440\\nBrightness: 300 nits\\nContrast ratio: 3000:1\\nRefresh rate: 144Hz\\nResponse time: 4ms\\nConnectivity: 2x DisplayPort 1.4, 2x HDMI 2.0, 1x 3.5mm audio jack\\nPrice: $289.99\\n\\nProsConsGreat contrast rangeNot quite bright enough144Hz refresh rateOlder panel techBudget price\\n\\nCheck it out at Xiaomi\\n\\nDesign\\nDespite being fairly large at 34-inches wide, it is surprisingly unobtrusive. The slender neck looks almost too thin to support it, but the base is sturdy, well-balanced and has a nice little loop to route cables through to keep things neat. \\nThe stand doesn\\u2019t take up too much desk real estate and has options to adjust height, tilt, and swivel for comfort. It actually looks fairly elegant when all is said and done. At the rear is a circle of LEDs that light up purple when the monitor is in use. It looks nice, but it\\u2019s difficult to tell what it is actually for.Article continues after adArticle continues after ad\\n\\nA more interesting aspect is the monitor curve. It has a 1500R curve, which is not the most aggressive one out there, but is certainly noticeable on a monitor of its size. The size and shape of the screen provide a 21:9 aspect ratio. This can take some getting used to, as it feels quite narrow at first, like watching things through a weirdly curved letterbox. Once you get used to it, the level of immersion is very impressive.Related:TCL reveals OLED monitor & it\\u2019s nothing like what we\\u2019ve seen beforeArticle continues after ad\\nFeatures\\nThe G34WQi comes with plenty of ports, two DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.0 should be more than enough to connect whatever devices you might need. It does lack a USB-C connector that has become common on many other monitors, but this is a fairly minor gripe. The lack of HDMI 2.1 is also a disappointment, considering it\\u2019s a gaming monitor being released in 2024.\\n\\nThe on-screen menu comes with a surprisingly diverse number of features. The menu is very nicely laid out and easy to navigate. It comes with a broad range of presets, and many options such as Gamma, color hue, and saturation. Article continues after adArticle continues after ad\\nOptions such as Game mode, HDR, and AMD Freesync are not on by default so some fiddling is needed to get the best out of the monitor for whatever you are watching or playing.\\nControlling the menus involves reaching around the back to a little purple joystick just behind the lower right-hand bevel. It is awkward, but it functions fine.\\n\\nThe panel uses the older VA technology. Though it is probably out of the question for OLED at this price point, IPS would have been nice.Article continues after ad\\nThe refresh rate goes up to 144Hz, but you do have to set the on-screen menus to do this, and to enable AMD Freesync, which is tucked away in the menus alongside the HDR option. \\nWatching the HBO Chernobyl miniseries on this monitor with HDR enabled was incredible. The curved monitor and a good pair of headphones made me feel like I was going into the water under the reactor with the volunteers at the end of episode 2.Article continues after adArticle continues after ad\\nGaming performance\\nWith AMD Freesync enabled it looks and feels great. Cyberpunk 2077 popped and I felt suitably immersed in the seedy underbelly of Night City. Using the monitor for Dead by Daylight provided something of an advantage, as the wider field of view gave me a better chance of keeping an eye out for whichever killer was out for my blood.\\n\\nThe only real problem was that the screen just was not quite bright enough. In daylight, it struggles to keep up, leaving everything looking either washed out or too dark to properly see anything, no matter how I fiddled with the settings.Article continues after ad\\nThe good news is that color accuracy and Gamma were both very good. Details were easy to see, and color and contrast looked exactly the way it should. Color temperature tended to be a bit on the cooler side, even after messing with presets.\\nShould you buy it?\\nThe Xiaomi Mi 34 curved monitor G34WQi is a great choice for an entry-level ultrawide monitor.Article continues after ad\\nIt lacks a bit of brightness, and it does take quite a bit of tinkering with the on-screen menus in order to get the best out of it. Once you do, however, it performs remarkably well for something so inexpensive at just $289.99.Article continues after ad\\nThe 144Hz refresh rate and FreeSync cater to gamers, while the HDR option makes it a decent choice for content creation, or just watching movies.\\nI actually changed my monitor setup entirely. I used to use two monitors for work and leisure, but they\\u2019ve both been replaced by a single Xiaomi monitor which can pretty much do it all. \\nOur Verdict \\u2013 4/5\\nThis Xiaomi Mi Curved gaming monitor G34WQi does have some compromises to bring it down to its affordable price. The older panel tech and the lack of brightness are two obvious points.Despite this, it\\u2019s a well-made monitor that clearly displays the benefits of curved ultrawide setups for clarity and immersion.Article continues after adArticle continues after ad\\nThose with deep pockets might be better served by something like the Samsung Odyssey G9, but for those on a more modest budget, it makes for an an excellent choice.\\nkeep readingShoppingGigantic Samsung gaming monitor gets 31% discount in Amazon Spring SaleRosalie NewcombeTechLightning-fast MSI gaming monitor price slashed by 27% in Amazon dealRebecca Hills-DutyTech240Hz Samsung Odyssey monitor price plummets by 47% in unmissable dealRosalie NewcombeTechDazzling LG ultrawide 160Hz gaming monitor gets 27% discount at AmazonRosalie NewcombeTechGigantic Samsung ultrawide 4K monitor plummets to lowest-ever price in Amazon dealRebecca Hills-DutyTechGet $200 off LG Ultragear monitor in top Best Buy dealRebecca Hills-DutyTechLG OLED gaming monitor drops to lowest-ever price in unmissable dealRebecca Hills-DutyTechCurved Acer gaming monitor price slashed by 49% in Amazon dealRosalie NewcombeAbout The AuthorRebecca Hills-DutyRebecca is a Tech Writer at Dexerto, specializing in PC components, VR, AMD, Nvidia and Intel.

Hook your expensive Apple laptop into a quality display, and not only will you increase your screen real estate, many of the monitors below provide incredibly vibrant and color accurate pictures.\\u00a0We use a Klein K 10-A colorimeter and a battery of software tests, putting every MacBook Pro monitor through its paces when we review one. You can be sure we\\u2019d never recommend a subpar display to pair with your high-end laptop, even if it was a cheap panel.\\u00a0My current favorite pick as the best monitor for MacBook Pro I find most easy to recommend to most people is the remarkable Apple Studio display. This astounding 5K screen looks incredibly vivid, and its six-speaker sound system means the Studio serves up compelling audio. If you\\u2019re looking for something a lot more affordable, the Asus TUF VG28UQLIA is the best cheap MacBook Pro monitor, partly because it produces such pleasingly accurate colors.\\u00a0The list of the best MacBook Pro monitors I\\u2019ve curated below covers a number of budgets, so if money is an issue right now, you should still be able to buy a model that won\\u2019t do too much damage to your finances. Again, we\\u2019te tested all of these screens thoroughly, so you can be rest assured every one of these Apple-compatible displays has something to offer MacBook Pro users.The quick list\\nBest overall MacBook Pro monitor\\n\\n\\n1.

But it also has unique features that any Mac user can enjoy, like a killer (for a monitor) six-speaker sound system and a 12MP ultrawide camera that supports Apple's Center Stage feature, courtesy of an onboard A13 Bionic chip. \\u00a0With its ultrawide camera, fantastic speaker setup and gorgeous 27-inch 5K screen, this is easily one of the\\u00a0best monitors for MacBook Pro\\u00a0owners seeking an external display.\\u00a0Read our full Apple Studio Display review.The best budget MacBook Pro monitor(Image credit: Tom's Guide)2.

Yet in our book, a top-tier 4K monitor with a 144Hz refresh rate and two HDMI 2.1 ports is damn good value for money.Apart from its reasonable price, the VG28UQL1A is simply a gorgeous unit, with some of the richest and most accurate colors of any gaming display we've tested. The screen's HDR capabilities are almost unmatched, especially the way it handles reds, oranges and pinks. This panel even boasts good speakers, which not many gaming monitors can claim.Read our full Asus TUF VG28UQL1A review.The best 4K MacBook Pro monitor(Image credit: Dell)3. Dell UltraSharp U2720QBest 4K monitor for MacBook Pro overallSpecificationsDimensions: 24.1 x 7.3 x 20.7 inches (with stand)Screen Size: 27 inchesResolution: 3840 x 2160Refresh Rate: 60 HzInputs: DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-CToday's Best DealsView at NeweggView at Amazon(Black)View at Amazon(LED)Reasons to buy+Good color accuracy+Doubles as a USB hub+Thin bezelsReasons to avoid-Underwhelming brightness-Meager 60Hz refresh rateThe Dell UltraSharp U2720Q is a workhorse of a 4K monitor that does everything pretty well, making it our overall pick for the best MacBook Pro monitor. This 27-inch display offers great color reproduction, and its 3840 x 2160 resolution lets you work and play on your MacBook at 4K.\\u00a0We also appreciate this monitor's thin-bezelled InfinityEdge display design, as thin bezels tend to help whatever you're looking at pop off the screen. This UltraSharp offers plenty of ports, too, and it has both USB-A and USB-C downstream ports, meaning you can plug USB accessories directly into the monitor and (as long as your laptop is connected via USB) use it as an impromptu USB hub for your MacBook.With an MSRP of just over $500 it's reasonably priced, too \\u2014 the only big downside is that the UltraSharp is neither as bright (advertised as maxing out at 350 nits) nor as fast (60Hz refresh rate) as the Liquid Retina XDR display built into the 2021 MacBook Pros. But if you just need a spacious 4K display to expand your MacBook's screen real estate and get more done, Dell's 27-inch UltraSharp is a great pick.THe best gaming MacBook Pro monitor(Image credit: Razer)4. Razer Raptor 27    The best overall gaming monitor for MacBook ProOur expert review:    SpecificationsDimensions: 24.2 x 15.3 x 7.5 inchesScreen Size: 27 inchesResolution: 2560 x 1440Refresh Rate: 144 HzInputs: DisplayPort, HDMI, USB-CToday's Best DealsCheck Amazon Prime Day(HDR)Reasons to buy+Gorgeous display+Smart design+Straightforward menusReasons to avoid-Very expensive compared to others on this list-Requires USB-C for customizationThe Razer Raptor 27 is currently our pick for the best MacBook Pro gaming monitor. This 27-inch screen displays gorgeous colors with stunning accuracy, at crisp quad HD resolutions. You can run games at more than 120 frames per second and see every frame, thanks to the Raptor 27\\u2019s fast refresh rate.The model we reviewed has a 144Hz refresh rate, but you can get an even faster 164HZ model for about $100 more. And though the 2560 x 1440 resolution delivers fewer pixels per inch than your MacBook Pro's Liquid Retina XDR display, it still displays more than enough detail to make games look great and run well. In other words, it\\u2019s a nearly perfect midpoint of performance and accessibility.The only real downside to the Raptor 27 is that it\\u2019s expensive, especially compared to other gaming monitors with similar specs. But you\\u2019re also paying for the monitor\\u2019s excellent physical design, which makes the ports extremely easy to access, and the cables very simple to manage.Read our full Razer Raptor 27 review.The best portable MacBook Pro monitor(Image credit: Tom's Guide)5.

A 14-inch, 1080p portable monitor that offers 10-point touch, it\\u2019s a good-looking, well-performing, and easy-to-transport addition to your tech arsenal that lives up to Lenovo\\u2019s long-standing reputation for function-forward and frill-free design.But with an asking price of $500, you have to really want a great portable monitor with touch controls to invest in the M14t. Otherwise, a few of the other monitors on this list are cheaper, with higher resolutions and better refresh rates. But if you really need an excellent portable monitor for your MacBook, the Lenovo ThinkVision M14t is our top overall pick. If you want one without touch functionality, Lenovo sells a cheaper non-touch version for $249.Read our full Lenovo ThinkVision M14t review.The best professional MacBook Pro monitor(Image credit: Future)6.

It's gorgeous to look at and easy to configure, and though it's not OLED the Pro Display XDR delivers sumptuous contrast that ensures blacks look infinitely inky next to blazing whites.\\u00a0You can even get a model with nano-textured glass that supposedly reduces glare without affecting contrast, but it will cost you an extra $1,000 on top of the already outrageous $4,999 starting price. It also doesn't come with a stand by default; you'll need to shell out another $999 to get one, though Apple's Pro Stand is at least a remarkably well-engineered stand.Of course, Apple can get away with charging these high prices because the equipment is high-quality and aimed at photo/video professionals working for big organizations. If you need the best monitor for photo/video editing on your MacBook Pro and don't mind paying an arm and a leg, the Pro Display XDR will serve you well.\\u00a0Read our full report on what it's like to use Apple's Pro Display XDR.How to choose the best MacBook Pro monitor for youHow to choose the best monitor for your MacBookFinding the best monitor for your MacBook can be a confusing experience, especially if you're unsure what you need. There are a few key details to pay attention to for any monitor, and some specific advice for certain specialized uses.Size: A larger monitor is generally better simply because it offers the most visual real estate, which is better for both full-screen media consumption and split-screen multitasking. Higher resolution is also better, since it allows you to see more detail and fit more information on the screen. The old phrase \\\"bigger is better\\\" applies to both here, and we recommend opting for larger screens and higher resolution whenever possible. However, keep in mind that you'll probably need to scale up the size of text (and macOS in general) on 4K monitors, as that resolution makes text hard to read on all but the largest monitors.Shape: Most monitors are simple rectangles you stand up on a desk, but nowadays you also have the option of buying monitors that are curved, or even portable. A simple flat monitor will serve most uses quite well, but you might want to try a curved monitor if you want a more immersive experience (especially when gaming) since the curve keeps all areas of the monitor within easy viewing distance. Likewise, you might like to invest in a portable monitor instead of a traditional one if you want an external display that's easy to use with your MacBook Pro on the go.\\u00a0Response time: If you care about playing the latest games under optimal conditions, you'll want to look for a monitor with low response time. This measures how long it takes for the display to respond to what you're doing, and it's typically expressed as a measurement (in milliseconds) of how long it takes a pixel on the display to go from one color to another and back again.\\u00a0Unless you're planning to play games on your MacBook that demand quick reflexes or pinpoint accuracy, you really don't need to worry about response time. In general, anything under 10ms is good, though 5ms or less is better for gaming. Many gaming monitors promise response times as low as 1ms, which is about as good as you can hope for.Refresh rate: Refresh rate measures how many times per second your monitor can draw a new image. It's measured in Hertz, and again if you're not planning on doing a lot of intense gaming you probably don't need to worry about this very much. Most monitor achieve refresh rates of 60Hz or less, and that's plenty for watching videos or getting work done. However, the new MacBook Pros have Liquid Retina XDR displays that can achieve variable refresh rates of up to 120Hz, so you'll need a monitor with at least a 120Hz refresh rate if you want it to be as good as your MacBook's display.If you want to play games at higher than 120 frames per second, or you're planning on working with video at framerates higher than 120 fps, you'll want a monitor with even higher refresh rates. 120Hz is as high as most monitors go, but some gaming monitors can achieve refresh rates of 360Hz or higher.\\u00a0How we tested these monitorsHow we test the best monitors for MacBook ProsWhen seeking out the best monitors, we test every display we review with our Klein K 10-A colorimeter, paired with testing software. We use this high-quality scope to measure the display's brightness levels, color gamut and color accuracy.Brightness is measured in nits, or candela per square metre (cd/m2). More nits means a higher brightness, which translates into clearer picture, brighter color and usually a more realistic looking image. For basic monitors, we expect a display backlight to produce between 2-300 nits of brightness, though HDR (high dynamic range) displays will often exceed that with a higher maximum brightness. However, brightness alone doesn't make for a great display, since some monitors will wash out colors or offer inconsistent backlight that varies in some portions of the display panel.HDR also presents its own testing challenges, as new capabilities and standards allow a monitor to offer higher peak luminance than our standard tests will register. When in doubt, read an individual review for a discussion of these issues, and how an individual product will handle each.Color is the other big concern for displays. Monitors that produce more colors have a larger color gamut, as measured under the sRGB or P3 color standards. This is presented as a percentage, with higher percentages indicating more colors.Color accuracy is the other aspect of color, which lets us measure how closely a monitor can reproduce a given shade. This is presented as a Delta-E rating, which indicates the level of deviation from perfect. Zero is a perfect score, while higher numbers indicate lower accuracy.We also test a display's response time, using a Leo Bodnar input lag tester. This device measures how long it takes a signal to travel from a source device to the monitor and show up on the display. Measured in milliseconds, this number is most useful for Mac gamers and anyone that needs immediate onscreen feedback from any input.Finally, every monitor we test is also used for web browsing, streaming video and gaming, as well as the writing of the review itself. Our anecdotal testing will often allow us to note the quirks of a display that lab testing might miss, whether it's difficulty in scaling content or issues with backlight or color reproduction.Round up of today's best dealsApple Studio Display $1,599.99 $1,499.99ViewSee all pricesAsus TUF Gaming VG28UQL1A $649 $580.25ViewSee all pricesDell U2720Q $719.99ViewSee all pricesRazer Raptor 27 $897ViewSee all pricesLenovo ThinkVision M14t $484ViewSee all pricesApple Pro Display XDR $5,999.99ViewSee all pricesWe check over 250 million products every day for the best pricespowered by \\n\\nGet the top Amazon Prime Day deals right in your inbox: Sign up now!Receive the hottest deals and product recommendations alongside the biggest tech news from the Tom's Guide team straight to your inbox!Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.\\nDave MeiklehamSocial Links NavigationUK Computing EditorDave is a computing editor at Tom\\u2019s Guide and covers everything from cutting edge laptops to ultrawide monitors.

Some use OLED (organic LED) panels to give you the deepest blacks and striking contrast, others have incredibly fast response times that make both work and play a smooth, seamless experience. \\n\\nGranted, curved monitors can be more expensive than their flatter counterparts. But according to Shahbaz Khan, a systems administrator for a Canadian software company, with over 10 years of experience in the information technology (IT) industry, they are an investment that can pay off if you spend a majority of your time at your monitor. \\n\\nHe said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s about the experience, at the end of the day. You feel completely immersed in whatever you\\u2019re playing, watching or working on, and it feels easier on the eyes. It\\u2019s more engaging, especially for gamers and people who frequently work with graphics and content creation. It\\u2019s a more convenient way to work and play.\\u201d \\n\\nScroll below to read his advice on how curved monitors differ from flat displays, and what kind of monitor would work best for you (because not all curved monitors are the same). Buy yours with Amazon Prime, and get it as early as tomorrow. \\n\\n1. Best Overall: Alienware AW3423DWF QD-OLED\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPros \\n\\n\\n\\nCrisp, vibrant visuals  \\nFast refresh rate and low latency\\nExcellent connectivity options\\n\\n \\n\\nCons \\n\\n\\n\\nHeavy and bulky\\n\\n \\n\\nIf you\\u2019re looking for a high-quality monitor that checks all of the boxes, in terms of size, resolution, connectivity and design, Alienware\\u2019s QD-OLED curved monitor is the one to get. Its sleek 1800R curved display wraps around your field of view, and features Legend 2 AlienFX lighting on its rear, for added flair. The Quantum Dot OLED display, with a 165Hz refresh rate and 21:9 aspect ratio is impressive; it also offers six pre-set picture modes that are optimised for different gaming genres. AMD FreeSync Premium Pro and 0.1ms response time offer superb gaming performance, no matter how demanding the title you\\u2019re playing. However, do note the monitor is large and quite heavy at 9.3kg, with V-shaped legs that take up considerable space on a desk. Still, it offers excellent adjustability: the 35-inch screen can be raised or lowered by 4.3 inches, tilted backward by -5 degrees, or forward up to 21 degrees. A rare addition is its swivel feature \\u2013 it can swivel by 20 degrees, both left and right \\u2013 something most curved displays cannot manage. Reviewers love the include of an HDMI 2.1 port in this monitor, which was lacking in its predecessor. It also includes a pair of DisplayPorts, four USB-A ports, a headphone jack and a line-out port. \\n\\nBonus: Buy with 0% installments and pay Dh326.67 for 12 months with select banks. \\n\\nWarranty: Amazon offers one-year extended warranty by Salama Care for Dh227, and two-year extended warranty for Dh375. \\n\\n2. Best for Gaming: Asus TUF Gaming Monitor\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPros \\n\\n\\n\\nBright hi-res screen  \\nFast refresh rate \\nFreeSync Premium technology\\nGood connectivity options \\n\\n \\n\\nCons \\n\\n\\n\\nNo local dimming\\n\\n \\n\\nA device that has all the essentials for smooth, stutter-free gaming, Asus TUF is a 34-inch WQHD (wide quad high definition) monitor that curves at 1500R for immersive gameplay. Gaming feels incredibly responsive here, according to reviewers, thanks to a 165Hz refresh rate that purges lag and motion blur, and FreeSync Premium technology that eliminates screen tearing and choppy frame rates. The monitor\\u2019s bright HDR visuals peak at 400 nits, so it can combat glare in well-lit environments. Although it\\u2019s primarily a gaming monitor, you can use it for productivity tasks as well \\u2013 there\\u2019s plenty of screen space for multitasking. There\\u2019s also extensive connectivity, with two DisplayPorts 1.4, two HDMI 2.0 ports, and two USB Hub ports. On the downside, while it has an excellent contrast ratio that leads to deep blacks, it doesn\\u2019t include a local dimming feature for richly detailed visuals. \\n\\nBonus: Buy with 0% installments and pay Dh152.92 for 12 months with select banks. \\n\\nWarranty: Amazon offers one-year extended warranty by Salama Care for Dh108, and two-year extended warranty for Dh179. \\n\\n3. Best Ultrawide: Samsung Odyssey Neo G9\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPros \\n\\n\\n\\nLarge and bright hi-res screen  \\nExcellent reflection handling\\n240Hz refresh rate \\nIncludes height, tilt and swivel adjustments\\n\\n \\n\\nCons \\n\\n\\n\\nNarrow viewing angles\\n\\n \\n\\nSamsung makes some of the best curved monitors out there right now, according to Khan. The Odyssey Neo G9 is one with a massive wingspan, thanks to its 49-inch screen and 32:9 aspect ratio, which lets you lose yourself in gaming or content creation. The large, hi-res screen offers enough space for multitasking, gaming or media consumption, and reviewers say it\\u2019s bright enough to combat glare in well-lit spaces. Two HDMI 2.1 inputs, along with 240Hz refresh rate with FreeSync support and G-SYNC compatibility, all make it an excellent canvas for HDR (high dynamic range) content. Thanks to its QLED panel and local dimming capabilities, the blacks here are rich and deep, and it offers a large colour gamut. Some reviewers do note that it\\u2019s not the best screen to share with someone else, since its aggressive screen curve means narrower viewing angles. \\n\\nBonus: Buy with 0% installments and pay Dh333.33 for 12 months with select banks. \\n\\nWarranty: Amazon offers one-year extended warranty by Salama Care for Dh227, and two-year extended warranty for Dh375. \\n\\n4. Best Value: Gigabyte G27FC\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPros \\n\\n\\n\\n1080p Full HD display   \\nSturdy, adjustable design\\nExcellent gaming performance\\n\\n \\n\\nCons \\n\\n\\n\\nNo HDMI 2.1 port\\n\\n \\n\\nLooking for a curved screen on a budget? Gigbayte\\u2019s G27FC is a good place to start. This 27-inch gaming monitor offers 1080p Full HD resolution and 165Hz refresh rate \\u2013 perfect for playing PC games at higher framerates. The screen curves at 1500R for an immersive feel, even though the curve is not immediately obvious when you\\u2019re sitting right in front of the monitor. Adaptive-Sync (FreeSync Premium) puts an end to choppy gameplay and broken frames, and a speedy 1ms response time fully eliminates image lag and tearing. The device has a no-frills design, and can be mounted on a wall, a monitor arm or via its included stand. There is a decent array of ports: a DisplayPort, two HDMI 1.4 inputs, two USB 3.0 ports for charging devices, a USB-B port and a headphone jack. Reviewers wish, however, that it came with a HDMI 2.1 port to support the advanced display functions of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. \\n\\nBonus: Buy with 0% installments and pay Dh133.49 for 12 months with select banks. \\n\\n5. Best Budget: LG 34GP63A Curved Ultragear QHD\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPros \\n\\n\\n\\nUltrawide screen  \\nHandles dark scenes well \\nIncludes several useful features\\nGood connectivity options\\nBuilt-in speakers \\n\\n \\n\\nCons \\n\\n\\n\\nAudio quality is mediocre\\n\\n \\n\\nLG\\u2019s 34GP63A Ultragear is an affordable ultrawide monitor that offers plenty of bang for its buck. Its 34-inch quantum HD curved panel has an aspect ratio of 21:9 and a 160Hz native refresh rate with 1ms motion blur reduction that reduces blurring and ghosting. HDR10 support and the ability to cover the entire sRGB colour space helps it achieve vivid, accurate colours without over-saturation. The backlight of the monitor is flicker-free, and you can also select a low blue light pre-set to reduce eye strain. Reviewers are surprised to find additional features at this price point \\u2013 from a Black Stabiliser that dynamically brightens dark scenes, to Dynamic Action Sync that helps reduce input lag. There are plenty of connectivity options, including two HDMI 2.0 ports, a DisplayPort 1.4, and a headphone jack. On the downside, several users complain that despite the built-in speakers, the audio is not as loud or dynamic as they would like. Overall, if you\\u2019re on a tight budget, this is a monitor you won\\u2019t regret buying. \\n\\nBonus: Buy with 0% installments and pay Dh104.92 for 12 months with select banks. \\n\\nWarranty: Amazon offers one-year extended warranty by Salama Care for Dh74, and two-year extended warranty for Dh122. \\n\\nHow do curved monitors differ from flat monitors? \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n            Business professionals and those in creative fields will also find curved monitors useful for productivity tasks.\\n            Image Credit: Shutterstock\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe most obvious difference, of course, is in their shape and design. \\n\\nCurved displays are considered to be more immersive, since they lend a feeling of dimensionality that you don\\u2019t usually find in a flat panel. You get a wider than usual field of view, with minimal distortion at the edges. \\n\\nAccording to Khan, because of their large screen real estate, graphic designers, photographers and other creative professionals would find that these monitors offer more natural viewing angles than a flat screen. Those who like to multitask would appreciate that they can open several documents and windows at a time, with minimal eyestrain. And gamers, of course, would enjoy the three-dimensional, immersive view that\\u2019s well-suited to gameplay with a lot of action, like racing games and flight simulators. \\n\\nHowever, it\\u2019s worth noting that not all curved displays are the same. Those used for general purposes offer a gentle curvature, while gaming and ultrawide productivity monitors have a more noticeable, pronounced curve. \\n\\nYou can actually measure the curve to understand what kind of monitor you\\u2019re looking at. Many have a 1800R curvature, which means if you lined up enough of these monitors side by side to form a circle, the radius would be 1,800mm or 1.8m. Monitors with sharper curves in this situation, would have a smaller radius, as low as 800R. \\n\\nWhat kind of curved monitor should I get? \\n\\nFor consumers\\u2019 purposes, it\\u2019s important to determine what you\\u2019re using the monitor for, in the first place. Based on your priorities, there are some factors worth considering, according to our expert: \\n\\nSize: In terms of screen size, Khan said: \\u201cThe bigger the better, but you should still maintain a safe viewing distance from the monitor so that it\\u2019s easy on the eyes.\\u201d From 24 inches to 49 inches, curved monitors come in a range of sizes. Most users would find a size of about 35 inches to be optimal for immersive gaming, watching videos, or tiling multiple windows. These monitors would also fit easily on most desks. \\n\\nResolution: Since curved monitors tend to use ultrawide panels, they usually have 21:9 or 32:9 aspect ratios (the latter is considered \\u2018super ultrawide\\u2019), instead of the usual 16:9 horizontal-to-vertical ratio of most monitors. The wider these panels, the more space you get for multitasking and e-sports. But note that if you\\u2019re watching a movie, it likely would not fit the entire screen. \\n\\nConnectivity: Most ports on curved monitors tend to face downward on the rear of the panel, so it\\u2019s a good idea to check all the ports to make sure you have what you need. Also, set up any cables during initial installation, since these monitors can be bulky and unwieldy to fiddle around with. \\n\\nErgonomics: Other key factors to consider are adjustments you can make to the monitor\\u2019s height and tilt function. \\n\\nOur recommendations are independently chosen by Gulf News editors.

Thirty years after the first Audi A4, the sharpened design language of the latest generation, now called the Audi A5, captivates with premium proportions. Both body styles, Sedan and Avant, perfectly embody the sporty essence of the Audi design philosophy. A new interior design language creates a feeling of space and sets the displays on a digital stage. The new operating concept increases interaction with the vehicle. Efficient partially electrified combustion engines and exciting S models round off the range.Since 2024, AUDI AG has restructured the naming of its vehicles with the expansion of its model portfolio. The numbers for electric models and combustion engines will be differentiated - even numbers will stand for electrically powered models and odd numbers for vehicles with combustion engines. With the introduction of the latest generation, the Audi A4, a longstanding bestseller, will be called the Audi A5 and will be produced in Neckarsulm. It is offered in four new variants: the A5 Sedan and S5 Sedan and the A5 Avant and S5 Avant. These variants are the first models to be launched on the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC).Audi CEO Gernot D\\u00f6llner on the new model family: \\\"In addition to expanding our all-electric portfolio, we are launching a new generation of models with efficient combustion engines. The Audi A5 family with its sporty design, completely new interior and future-proof electronics architecture will be the first. The advanced MHEV plus technology enables partially electric driving and therefore even more efficient driving.\\\"\\n2025 Audi A5 SedanIn terms of vehicle length, the Sedan and Avant are identical to the nearest millimeter. With an overall length of 4,829 millimeters, they have clearly grown to the dimensions of the upper midsize segment. The increase in length compared to the predecessor model is 67 millimeters. The long wheelbase of 2,900 millimeters with short overhangs reflects the premium proportions and contributes to both the long-distance qualities of driving comfort and the generous interior space.At the same time, Audi is increasing the value of the new A5. Many of our customers' favorite features are now standard equipment - such as navigation, an electrically opening and closing trunk lid, or the telephone tray with inductive charging. Optional extras allow the vehicle to be tailored to individual preferences.These include, for example, the 10.9-inch passenger display, the Bang & Olufsen Premium sound system with 3D sound and headrest speakers, the panoramic glass roof with segmented switchable transparency that almost completely spans the passenger compartment, or the electric steering column adjustment with memory function. Customers can also purchase special equipment bundles that build on each other.Dynamic and muscular exterior designEven at first glance, the totally redesigned A5 family has a powerful and clean design. The modified proportions with a long wheelbase, large wheels, and flat, sporty body embody progressive dynamism and premium standards. This is particularly evident in the side view thanks to the stretched hood, whose length gives it a prestigious appearance. The power of the optional quattro drivetrain, distributed to both axles, is visually manifested in the powerfully modeled and three-dimensionally flared blisters, which flow smoothly into the body of the new A5.In the Sedan, the sporty, compact-looking greenhouse (the roof structure) runs to the rear with a sweeping curve, flows seamlessly into the flat rear window like a coup\\u00e9, and ends at the visually short tailgate with a striking spoiler lip. The tailgate is a strong symbiosis of design and functionality, which is new in this vehicle segment. It opens with the rear window, and its size makes access to the luggage compartment considerably easier. This results in a completely new Sedan concept for Audi.In the Avant, the dynamically taut roofline merges into a form-fitting integrated roof spoiler that spans the sporty, shallow rear window. The correspondingly raked D-pillars, which sit firmly on the powerful rear quattro blisters, emphasize the dynamic side view of the A5 Avant.The front is dominated by the wide and significantly flatter proportioned Singleframe with a three-dimensional honeycomb structure - in the S5 with larger honeycombs and L-shaped inserts. Together with the slim and precisely drawn headlights, it shapes the face of the vehicle and gives it a striking and focused expression. The strong sweep of the front section creates the appearance of very short overhangs.Three-dimensionally modeled inlets for the air curtains are positioned under the headlights and give the bumper a powerful and sporty appearance. On the S5 and the S line exterior, they are accentuated even further by a wide intake duct painted in a contrasting color.Distinctive grooves in the hood called \\\"spooncuts\\\" emphasize the sporty character. Thanks to the soft nose integrated into the bumper, the hood is flush with the front end. This allows a greater distance between the hood and the Singleframe and, therefore, a visually lower, more dynamic face.The sculptural geometry under the rear window in the transition to the light strip visually emphasizes the width of the new Audi A5 with light and shadow effects, giving the new Audi A5 Avant a more resolute, dynamic character.On both body shapes, the side window graphics reinforce the sporty, elongated effect of the silhouette. The blisters protruding powerfully from the shoulder area at the front and rear wheels are reminiscent of the Audi Urquattro and a core element of the Audi design DNA. \\\"Making technology visible\\\" is a central design principle of the Four Rings.The new flush-mounted door handles, which enable the doors to be unlocked electrically via an inductive sensor, fit logically into the clear design. The exterior mirrors are positioned on the door waistline in a sports-car-like manner, thus completing the dynamic overall impression of the new Audi A5 from the side view in addition to the aerodynamic advantages. The sill area has a decidedly sporty design - a light edge under the doors structures the volume and lends the vehicle body visual lightness and agility. On the S line exterior and the S model, the sportiness is further enhanced by a color-contrasting sill trim.The striking, unmistakably styled rear combines sporty, emotional design and intelligent technology. The combination of the sculptural geometry in the rear end with the continuous, three-dimensionally offset light strip gives the rear of the new Audi A5 presence and visual dynamism. In the new S5 Sedan, a lip spoiler provides additional downforce.Further highlights visible from the rear are the clear, modern design of the bumper with a dark diffuser - even sportier on the S line exterior - and the high-quality, rectangular exhaust tips. On the TFSI, the exhaust tips are integrated into the diffuser on both sides; on the TDI variants, they appear as a rectangular twin tailpipe on the left-hand side of the vehicle. The S model has the iconic round twin tailpipes on the right and left in a new, sharpened design.Three exterior versions and eleven colorsThe range structure is divided into three exterior versions: basic, advanced, and S line exterior. The S model also has its own exterior. On the S line exterior and the S model, the front air intakes are larger, and the diffuser at the rear is significantly sportier. The sill trims for the S line exterior and S model also contribute to the dynamic character. The trims around the side windows are finished in anodized aluminum as standard. The S line exterior stands out with details in anodized matt anthracite aluminum, while the S model features design elements in anodized matt silver aluminum.The black exterior package is also available for the S line exterior and the S model. With this, the Audi rings at the front and rear are finished in anthracite gray. The radiator grille and the grill inserts, the sill trims, the door handles, the Singleframe and the diffuser at the rear, the window well trims, and the mirror housings are colored in black, as are the aluminum trim strips around the side windows. The exhaust system also features blacked-out tailpipe trims.There are eleven colors to choose from for the new Audi A5, including the Arkona White solid paint finish. Glacier White, Mythos Black, Chronos Gray, and new colors Grenadine Red and Horizon Blue are available as metallic paint finishes. Firmament Blue, Florett Silver, and Daytona Gray pearl effect, the latter of which is exclusively available for the S models or vehicles with S line exterior, complete the range.Audi Sport also offers Ascari Blue metallic for the S line exterior and S model. The new color Magnetic Grey is reserved exclusively for the \\\"Edition One\\\" with S line exterior and \\\"Edition One\\\" S models. The \\\"Edition One\\\" is a sporty special model for the Sedan and Avant, offered for two years, with exclusive design elements such as trim in a matte magnesium gray chrome look.Three equipment packages with tech optionsDepending on customers' choices, the new Audi A5 models can be ordered with different equipment packages that bundle a wide range of optional extras. The \\\"Tech\\\", \\\"Tech plus\\\" and \\\"Tech pro\\\" packages build on each other: In addition to exclusive options, the top-of-the-line \\\"Tech pro\\\" package also includes all the optional extras from the other packages.Highlights of the respective packages include:Tech: full LED headlights, 3-zone air conditioning, Audi MMI plusTech plus: Matrix LED headlights, passenger display, comfort package plusTech pro: Digital OLED rear lights, heated steering wheel, heated front and rear seats, adaptive damper controlThe wheel rangeThe new Audi A5 models on the German market roll on 17 and 18-inch light-alloy wheels as standard, depending on the exterior variant and engine specification. For the S line exterior and the S model, 19-inch wheels are standard. There is a choice of 17-inch wheels, also available with aero trims in Scandium Gray, three 18-inch wheels, five 19-inch wheels, and four 20-inch wheels. Audi Sport is responsible for two 19-inch and all 20-inch wheels, including an all-black 19-inch wheel. One highlight is the new forged Audi Sport wheel in 20-inch size. It is the only wheel in the portfolio with a tri-color design.The new interior design: technology meets comfortThe design of the new Audi A5 interior is based on four characteristic features. Firstly, the interior is designed to be human-centric, i.e., consistently geared toward the needs of its users. The second special feature is the Digital Stage, a digital stage clearly aligned in front of the driver and front passenger in the form of the Audi MMI displays. With its Material Driven Design, the new Audi A5 meets the demand for a generous sense of space with a high level of comfort. The interior's clear structure and logical operation also provide an overview in all situations and form the fourth feature: Visual Clarity.Human CentricThe clear structure of the new interior balances technology, aesthetics, and sustainability. The deliberate placement of elements in the foreground or background creates a three-dimensional spatial architecture individually tailored to the occupants in terms of design and ergonomics and conveys a generous sense of space.Digital StageThe digital stage with the Audi MMI panoramic display and the optional MMI passenger display shape the interior. The clearly positioned displays are perfectly integrated into the interior. The slim, free-standing Audi MMI panoramic display features a curved design and OLED technology. While the curved shape of the display ensures optimum accessibility of the touch area, the design of the outer contour creates a strong allusion to the typical Audi single frame.The panoramic display emphasizes the driver orientation of the dashboard and provides a sharpened cockpit feeling, giving the driver a perfect overview. Special ambient lighting sets the digital stage for the driver and makes the curved display appear to float.Below, the black panel architecture extends from the driver's side to the passenger side, creating space for the optional MMI passenger display. Active Privacy Mode allows the infotainment to be used while driving without visually distracting the driver. At the same time, it offers the option of supporting the driver with navigation tasks, for example. In the base version, a black high-gloss panel is installed here.Material Driven DesignAs a contrast and to balance the digital and technical areas, the new Audi A5 interior features the Softwrap. It runs from door to door across the entire dashboard width and visually stretches the interior horizontally. Together with the fabric panels in the door and the armrests, this creates a homely ambiance. The philosophy of Material Driven Design offers the potential to customize the interior according to your own ideas. The colors and high-quality materials of the interior can also be found in the seats in addition to the Softwrap.The materials were also selected from a functional point of view while ensuring a clear design differentiation of the various vehicle areas in the interior. Comfort-oriented areas are emphasized with generous surfaces and soft materials. In contrast, the precisely designed control areas are consistently finished in high-quality, high-gloss black to ensure the necessary clarity when interacting with the vehicle.The Smart Door Panel is an excellent example of this philosophy of materials. The black-panellook control element is integrated into the handle of the driver's door and blends seamlessly into the modern interior. It contains the most important functions, such as mirror settings, seat, and door functions, as well as light and visibility settings.Visual ClarityFunctionality and aesthetics can be found in the interior down to the smallest detail. This design approach is evident in the door opener and air vents. These are connected via a clasp that continues visually from the dashboard to the door trim. The contour light and the exit warning are also integrated into this finely crafted element.If optioned, the Bang & Olufsen lettering here is also illuminated. Low-lying, slim, horizontally aligned air vents harmoniously complete the overall picture. This highly premium area impressively demonstrates how the clever integration of functions leads to clarity in design.Interior light designThe clearly designed A5 interior is also showcased in the dark. The contour light in the dashboard and doors emphasizes the width of the interior. The indirect light below the MMI panoramic display and in the center console creates a visual floating effect. The premium materials in the doors are illuminated to great effect.In addition, there is the dynamic interaction light (IAL) with various functions to support the car's interaction with the occupants. It spans the entire interior width by means of a generous strip. LEDs are installed in the light strip, which means it fulfills three central functions. Firstly, it sets the scene for the interior. Secondly, the welcome function indicates when the vehicle is locked and unlocked. The IAL also provides support when it comes to safety. For example, the dynamic indicator light is visualized, but the IAL remains an additional display and does not replace a turn signal in the Virtual Cockpit. The dynamic interaction light is part of the ambient lighting package plus.New standards in digital lightWith the new A5, Audi is accentuating its leading role in lighting design and technology. The headlights and rear lights have a three-dimensional design and offer optional digital light signatures, bringing the physical and digital worlds together. At the front, the Audi A5 family optionally offers digital daytime running lights with LED technology and second-generation digital OLED rear lights at the rear.With around 60 segments per digital OLED panel, the A5 is increasingly acting as a display in the vehicle's rear. This enables car-to-x communication and increases road safety. A domain computer controls the communication light and the active digital light signature.In the case of the second-generation digital OLED rear lights, six OLED panels generate a new image several times per second through 364 segments using a specially developed algorithm. At the rear, all digital OLED segments are used for the active digital light signature. The luminous intensity within the combination rear light does not vary.With the second-generation digital OLED combination rear light, the Audi A5 family is taking lighting design, functionality, and, therefore, road safety in its class to a new level. The new digital OLED technology characterizes the appearance while also increasing the range of functions.The technology sets new standards in terms of personalization: With a total of eight digital light signatures included in the Matrix LED headlights combined with the digital OLED taillights, customers can personalize the appearance of their A5/S5 Sedan or A5/S5 Avant like never before. The selection is possible via the MMI touch display (Multi Media Interface) and the signatures can also be displayed via the myAudi app. The digital OLED tail lights of the new A5 can communicate with the immediate surroundings (Car-to-X).Audi has also taken the safety functions to a new level. The proximity detection known from the first generation of digital OLED rear lights has been extended in the A5 - the second generation of digital OLEDs - to include the communication light. For example, it warns other road users in advance of accidents and breakdowns.In addition to the regular taillight graphics, the communication light in the digital OLED rear light displays a specific static tail light signature with integrated warning symbols in critical driving or traffic situations. In the Audi A5, the brake lights are located behind the individual digital OLED panels - a unique arrangement for an Audi model. This creates a striking threedimensional shape with the LED tail light and the typically segmented digital light signature, which extends across the vehicle's full width, including the LED light strip.Audi MMI panoramic display and head-up displayThe slim, free-standing Audi MMI panoramic display has a curved design and OLED technology and consists of the Audi virtual cockpit with a 11.9-inch visible screen diagonal and the 14.5-inch MMI touch display.The display gives the interior a generous and airy feeling of space. With its curved shape, it is oriented towards the driver so that all functions can be operated easily without taking the eyes off the road for long. Special ambient lighting makes the Curved Display seem to float at night.Audi complements the digital stage for the front passengers with the optional 10.9-inch MMI front passenger display, which is also perfectly integrated into the dashboard design. This allows the front passenger to browse websites, stream video content, assist with navigation, or, for example, search for a gas station. The dynamic privacy mode prevents the driver from viewing distracting content, such as videos, while driving.The new Audi A5 can be optionally equipped with a new, advanced configurable head-up display (HUD). Audi is thus taking a major step forward in this display technology. The HUD can display a wide range of information, such as speed, active assistance systems, navigation instructions, or media data. For the first time, drivers have the option of controlling vehicle and infotainment functions via the Head-Up Display. The controls also allow scrolling through lists with direct selection using the steering wheel buttons. Thanks to the maximum utilization of the installation space and the adapted projection technology, the perceived image is more than 85 percent larger than before, and the projection is even more precise.The Audi assistant will also have access to additional online content in future, such as weather and general knowledge. The connection to ChatGPT (provided via Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service) brings knowledge from the Internet into the vehicle in natural language. The Audi assistant automatically recognizes whether a vehicle function is to be executed, a destination is to be searched for, or, for example, a weather forecast is to be called up. Only when the Audi system cannot answer general knowledge questions, for example, are they forwarded to ChatGPT. This is seamless for drivers, as all functions are integrated into the Audi assistant.E\\u00b3 enables high-performance networking of the vehicleWith the new electronic architecture E3 1.2 for the A5, customers experience digitalization in the vehicle more directly than ever before. The name E\\u00b3 stands for End-to-End Electronic Architecture. Its core elements are five high-performance computers, which Audi calls \\\"High Computing Performance\\\" (HCP). These computers cover all vehicle functions-from the powertrain and the assistance systems to the infotainment and comfort systems to the safety systems and back-end networking.The E\\u00b3 architecture is a scalable electronic architecture used throughout the Volkswagen Group. One development focus was on high-performance and secure networking of domain computers, control units, sensors, and actuators to manage more complex systems and maintain modularity. Another goal is a high-performance, seamless backend connection for car-to-x swarm data applications and computationally intensive offboard functions. Audi is gradually implementing the electronic architecture in all future vehicle models.Extensive range of driver assistance systemsAudi provides a wide range of driver assistance systems in the new A5, the functions of which significantly improve everyday life and road safety for all road users. A rear parking aid with distance display, cruise control and speed limiter, lane departure warning, efficiency assistant, and attention and drowsiness assistant are standard features from market launch.Additional assistance packages can be configured as an option. These include Adaptive cruise assist plus, which uses high-resolution map data and swarm data from other vehicles calculated in the cloud to optimize traffic sign recognition and assist with acceleration, maintaining speed and distance, and lane guidance. Active front assist combines four assistance functions: front emergency brake assist, evasion assist, turn assist, and front cross traffic assist. Other assistance systems available include traffic sign-based cruise control, park assist plus, and rear turn assist.Platform with efficient combustion engines and hybridizationThe new A5 series is based on the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC), a platform for conventionally powered vehicles with longitudinally mounted engines. This platform works with the E\\u00b3 architecture. At the same time, the PPC allows gradual electrification - initially in the form of mild hybrids. The PPC combines great variability and state-of-the-art technology with high economic viability.Lower consumption, more agility, and comfort with MHEV plusThe new MHEV plus system, based on a 48-volt onboard electrical system, simultaneously supports the combustion engine, reduces CO2 emissions, and increases performance. The new powertrain generator (PTG) enables partially electric driving, which reduces fuel consumption. The new MHEV plus system enables the A5 model series to achieve significant advantages in CO2 emissions and fuel consumption over an MHEV system. They total up to 10 g/km or 0.38 l/100 km for the 2.0 TDI (150 kW front-wheel drive/quattro) and up to 17 g/km or 0.74 l/100km for the V6 3.0 TFSI (270 kW quattro). The PTG can contribute up to 18 kW (24 PS) of electric power to the drive. When decelerating, the PTG recovers energy back into the battery through regenerative braking (recuperation) at up to 25 kW. On slight inclines and when maneuvering slowly, the car can be moved solely by the PTG.The electric powertrain can be partially used when driving slowly in the city, in slow-moving traffic, for example, on country roads, and when coasting towards a city limit. The PTG is attached directly to the transmission output shaft.Compared to the previous model, the recuperation power of up to 25 kW, made possible by the PTG, allows the battery to be recharged more quickly. This, in turn, can be used to propel the vehicle, power the electrical system, and sustain the air conditioning for a short time if required. This significantly reduces fuel consumption and, at the same time, increases comfort and performance.The response time when setting off is reduced, and the car is noticeably more agile. Another advantage of the system is the option of using an electric air conditioning compressor. This means that even when the combustion engine is switched off - for example, when costing or at a red light - the air conditioning can continue to operate at full power and keep the interior at a comfortable temperature.The integrated and blending-capable brake control system is used in all drivetrain variants. With this technology, the brake pedal and brake hydraulics are completely decoupled. On models with the MHEV plus system, it allows pressureless braking and achieves the necessary deceleration via recuperation alone - without using the friction brakes. The friction brake only kicks in when the brake pedal is pressed harder. The braking feel remains unaffected by this.The sophisticated operating strategy of the advanced hybrid system focuses not on electric range but on draining and filling the battery in fast cycles to always provide and recuperate enough electrical power. To ensure high charging and discharging performance of the 48-volt lithium iron phosphate battery, it is integrated into a low-temperature water cooling circuit that maintains the optimum operating temperature range of 25 to 45 degrees Celsius.Engine portfolio at market launchThe efficient engines in the Audi A5 family cover a wide range, from the conventional entry-level model to the comfortable long-distance runner and the dynamic sports car. The engine, transmission, degree of electrification, and drive type packages are geared towards our customers' expectations.The entry-level engine is a 2.0 TFSI with 110 kW (150 PS). This engine is optionally also available with 150 kW (204 PS). These TFSI engines are equipped with a turbocharger with variable turbine geometry (VTG) and work with a modified combustion process that is particularly fuel efficient under partial load. VTG technology enables a harmonious and agile torque build-up even at low engine speeds in gasoline engines. The turbo four-cylinder is available with a dual-clutch gearbox. The 110-kW variant is available as a purely front-wheel drive model, and the 150-kW variant with front-wheel or quattro ultra.The 2.0 TDI with 150 kW (204 PS) sets new standards in the A5 with its MHEV plus technology. This two-liter engine from the EA288 evo generation inherits the optimized combustion thanks to a cylinder pressure sensor, TwinDosing for exhaust emission control, and two balance shafts for smooth engine operation from its predecessor. It develops 400 Nm of torque between 1,750 and 3,250 rpm. The 2.0 TDI is available with a dual-clutch gearbox as a front-wheel or quattro ultra drive.The engine is partially electrified using the new 48-volt MHEV plus system to increase efficiency and comfort. The electric driving parts reduce CO2 emissions through high recuperation performance. In addition, the comfort of the TDI is further enhanced by a smooth engine start thanks to the 48-volt starter generator. The reaction time when setting off is reduced, and the car is noticeably more agile.The S5 as a sports car is based on a 3.0 V6 TFSI engine with 270 kW (367 PS) and an optimized combustion process, for the first time equipped with a turbocharger with variable turbine geometry (VTG) and MHEV plus technology. A strengthened S tronic dual-clutch transmission in the Audi S5 also lowers the weight on the front axle and makes the vehicle more agile.Partial electrification using the new 48-volt MHEV plus system reduces CO2 emissions thanks to its electrified drivetrain and high recuperation performance. Its fast, dynamic torque build-up underlines the sportiness of the S5. The standard use of a quattro sport differential with torque vectoring in combination with a variable all-wheel drive clutch is tuned for lateral dynamics at the highest level.More dynamic chassis and steering designThe handling characteristics typical of the Audi brand have also been further developed in the new A5. As a result of extensive detail work on the suspension and steering, the Audi A5 offers precise, effortless, and largely neutral handling, which can be differentiated significantly more between comfort and sportiness if the optional suspension with adaptive dampers is selected. From now on, only Audi progressive steering is used in the new A5.Stiffer steering and suspension mounts on the front axle ensure controlled and precise handling. In addition to the standard steel spring suspension, a sports suspension and the S sports suspension with adaptive damper control are available as options. The sports suspension is standard on the Audi A5 models with S line exterior and on the S models. Both variants of the sports suspension lower the trim level by 20 millimeters.The brake torque vectoring vehicle function developed by Audi, used for the first time in the Audi Q8 e-tron, noticeably improves driving. The system becomes active upon turning into a bend. As a result of the targeted braking intervention, the vehicle can turn in even more spontaneously and nimbly, counteracting understeer.In the entry-level version, the new Audi A5 is offered with 110 kW and purely front-wheel drive, while quattro ultra is available as an option on all other performance levels of the base models. This quattro technology distributes the drive torque flexibly to drive as efficiently as possible while fully utilizing all the advantages of all-wheel drive for maximum driving safety and dynamics.A multi-plate clutch can distribute torque between the front and rear axle in a wide range of ways- just as the respective driving situation requires. If the driving situation permits, the rear axle is automatically disengaged completely under partial load for maximum fuel efficiency. The quattro sport differential with torque vectoring, in combination with an adjustable all-wheel drive clutch, is fitted as standard in the S5 models. This gives the Audi S5 excellent lateral dynamics.Market launch and priceWith the new A5 family, Audi is beginning the next chapter of its successful history in the midsize segment. The new Audi A5 and Audi S5 will be launched in November 2024 in Germany and numerous other European countries.The Audi A5 family will be available to order in Germany from July 2024. The Audi A5 Sedan TFSI 110 kW will be offered in Germany at an entry price starting at EUR 45,200 and will include navigation, an electric trunk lid, and a telephone tray with inductive charging as standard.READ MORE\\nLatest cars (17-07-2024) 2025 Mini Cooper S 5-door (17-07-2024) 2025 Cadillac Escalade (17-07-2024) 2025 Cadillac Escalade-V (17-07-2024) 2025 Volkswagen ID.Unyx [CN] (16-07-2024) 2025 Audi A5 Avant (16-07-2024) 2025 Audi A5 Sedan (16-07-2024) 2025 Audi S5 Avant (16-07-2024) 2025 Audi S5 Sedan (16-07-2024) 2025 Dacia Spring (12-07-2024) 2025 Toyota GR86 Hakone Edition (12-07-2024) 2025 Ford Raptor T1 Dakar Rally (11-07-2024) 2025 Fiat Grande Pandashow more...[ Terms of Use | Privacy Policy ]\\u00a9 2005-2024\\n\\n\\n\",\n        \"type\": \"Document\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"lc\": 1,\n      \"type\": \"constructor\",\n      \"id\": [\n        \"langchain\",\n        \"schema\",\n        \"document\",\n        \"Document\"\n      ],\n      \"kwargs\": {\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"source\": \"https://www.pcworld.com/article/2000722/best-monitor-arms.html\",\n          \"title\": \"Best monitor arms 2024: The ultimate in flexibility | PCWorld\",\n          \"description\": \"A monitor arm is one of those quality-of-life upgrades\\u2014the added flexibility for adjusting your monitor's position and angle takes an office setup to the next level.

A monitor arm gives you more ways to move and position your display/s around your desk, and it can free up usable space on your desk surface. Plus, a monitor arm can make your desk setup look really cool.\\nThe only catch is the price. Most monitor arms worth buying will cost close to $200, and heavy-duty arms capable of holding two large displays are even pricier. The good news is that if you buy a good-quality monitor arm, you\\u2019ll likely never need to replace it. That\\u2019s why it\\u2019s important to choose wisely with your first monitor arm purchase. \\n\\n\\nTo help you with that, we\\u2019ve put several popular monitor arms through their paces to find the best of the bunch. Below you\\u2019ll find our curated list of recommended monitor arms, with thorough explanations of what qualities made them stand out. And below that, we point out some arms that we weren\\u2019t so keen on \\u2014 to provide a point of comparison.\\nIf you\\u2019re still on the fence about whether a monitor arm is worth the money and the time it takes to set up, read our article that answers why a monitor arm is most definitely worth it. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you\\u2019re looking for a new monitor to go with your monitor arm, see our roundups of the best monitors and best home office monitors for recommendations. \\nPrime Day starts July 16, 2024. Check out our\\u00a0curated list of all the best monitor deals on Amazon.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tErgotron LX \\u2013 Best monitor arm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Prices Today:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n$179.99 at  Amazon$205 at  Lenovo$275 at  CDW \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Ergotron LX is a sturdy, practical monitor arm that can handle most monitors. It\\u2019s easy to set up, easy to use, and (when purchased in its white or polished aluminum colorway) attractive.\\nErgotron positions the LX as an entry-level monitor arm, but the company\\u2019s definition of \\u201centry level\\u201d exceeds most competitors. The arm is primarily constructed from metal, with some plastic cladding, and can support monitors that weigh up to 25 pounds. Ergotron recommends sticking to monitors 34 inches wide or smaller. The monitor arm is backed by a 10-year warranty.\\nThe arm has a healthy range of adjustment that includes 13 inches of lift, 75 degrees of tilt, 360 degrees of rotation, and 360 degrees of pan (or swivel). While not as smooth as the Herman Miller Flo, I was able to adjust the monitor arm left, right, forward, and back without standing.\\nSetup is simple. The monitor has an included clamp and grommet mount. Installation is mostly handled with a bundled Allen wrench, though you\\u2019ll still need a Philips head screwdriver to attach your monitor to the VESA mount. Most owners will be able to install smaller monitors (24 to 27 inches) alone, but help is recommended for larger displays.\\nErgotron also avoids any serious flaws. I have a few nitpicks, sure. I think the clamp could be smaller. The white colorway doesn\\u2019t have a color coordinated VESA mount. And the arm\\u2019s overall design looks a bit industrial. Still, this is a bomb-proof mount, and it\\u2019s available under $200. \\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWorkstream by Monoprice \\u2013 Best budget monitor arm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Prices Today:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n$76.65 at  Amazon \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Workstream by Monoprice single monitor arm is a no-frills solution that delivers basic monitor arm features at an exceptionally low price.\\nThe monitor arm has an all-metal construction that in some ways feels sturdier than the Ergotron LX, as the Workstream doesn\\u2019t include as much plastic cladding. It\\u2019s not entirely a win, though, as the plastic that exists feels frail (and I even broke a small, though unnoticeable, bit while adjusting the monitor).\\nIt provides a good range of adjustment, with 13.2 inches of height and 90 degrees of tilt, swivel, and rotation. The arm\\u2019s height and tilt adjustment are comparable to others on this list, but it can\\u2019t swivel in a full circle, which may prove annoying if you frequently move a monitor arm to share your screen with colleagues.\\nThe Workstream\\u2019s slim budget is felt in its difficult setup and stiff operation. Users will need to install several screws for a clamp or gromet mount. More screws may need to be adjusted once the arm is in place, as its default tension proved inadequate for supporting a 32-inch monitor.\\nMonoprice lists the monitor as capable of supporting 20 pounds, but I felt the 32-inch monitor (which weighed 15 pounds) was pushing the Workstream to its limits. Monoprice also skimps on the warranty, offering just one year of coverage.\\nThese flaws are easily excused by the Workstream\\u2019s $60 price tag. It\\u2019s clearly less capable, less attractive, and more difficult to use than Ergotron\\u2019s LX, but it offers a good range of adjustment and durable construction for less than half the price. It\\u2019s an ideal choice for shoppers on a tight budget, as well as those who plan to install a small, light 24-inch or 27-inch monitor.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHerman Miller Flo \\u2013 Best upscale monitor arm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Prices Today:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n$295 at  Herman Miller \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWant a monitor arm that gets the job done and looks good doing it? The Herman Miller Flo is for you.\\nThe Flo\\u2019s design sets it apart from the pack. Herman Miller ditches the angular, industrial design of many competitors for a smooth, natural look. While clearly designed for a corporate office, it also fits in with a home office setup, where its friendly, approachable look helps it blend in with its surroundings. The Flo is backed by a 12-year warranty and offers 24/7 customer service.\\nIt\\u2019s easy to set up and use. The monitor\\u2019s clamp works similarly to other monitor arms I tested, but it\\u2019s more refined and requires fewer screws (a grommet is also available). The VESA mount is also excellent, providing a simple clip design that\\u2019s secure and can be easily pre-mounted to a monitor for simple installation. The way this mount works accommodates monitors that have a slightly recessed mount position, which may cause problems for other monitor arms.\\nThe monitor\\u2019s range of adjustment isn\\u2019t much different from other high-end monitor arms. It offers 13.3 inches of vertical adjustment, 80 degrees of tilt, and 360 degrees of swivel and rotation. That\\u2019s essentially identical to the less expensive Ergotron LX. The Flo\\u2019s operation is smoother, however: I found I could adjust a monitor\\u2019s height with a mere nudge.\\nSurprisingly, the Flo has a listed weight limit of 20 pounds and recommends use with monitors weighing at least 7 pounds. Most monitors fit within this range, but some heavier models won\\u2019t be compatible with the Flo.\\nHerman Miller lists the Flo at $295, which is a lot to ask for a single-monitor arm. The Ergotron LX offers similar features at a much lower price. However, the Flo is a smoother, more appealing monitor arm, and worth the upgrade if you want form with your function.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tErgotron HX \\u2013 Best heavy-duty monitor arm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Prices Today:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n$345 at  Lenovo$349 at  Amazon$349 at  CDW \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIt\\u2019s natural, given the only slight difference in name, to think the Ergotron HX is merely an uprated version of the Ergotron LX. That\\u2019s not the case. This is an entirely different monitor arm which pairs its increased capacity with improved build quality and a more professional look.\\nFirst, let\\u2019s talk weight. The Ergotron HX is rated to hold monitors that weigh up to 42 pounds and screen sizes up to 49 inches. That\\u2019s an extraordinarily high weight limit\\u2014I haven\\u2019t reviewed a single monitor in 2023 that exceeds it. I attached both a 32-inch widescreen and 38-inch ultrawide monitor, which weighed roughly 15 and 20 pounds, respectively, and the HX easily handled both.\\nThe use of plastic is minimal and reserved for small portions of cladding that appear used only for cable routing. The arm\\u2019s moving parts include larger, sturdier mechanisms, and felt extremely smooth in my use. Ergotron backs the arm with a 10-year warranty.\\nThe monitors range of adjustment is a bit limited compared to the LX. It offers 11.5 inches of height, 75 degrees of tilt, 180 degrees of swivel, and 360 degrees of rotation. However, a somewhat more limited height adjustment is typical in this category due to the size of monitors these stands are expected to carry.\\nThe monitor arm\\u2019s impressive design also provides a more robust look. This could be a con for some, however, as the arm can seem a bit\\u2026much in a home office setup. It\\u2019s an expensive arm, as well. Expect to pay about $350.\\nThe Ergotron HX is an obvious choice if you want to mount an ultrawide, super-ultrawide, or large format widescreen monitor on your desk.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHumanscale M2.1 with M/Connect \\u2013 Best monitor arm w/ built-in dock\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Prices Today:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n$356 at  Humanscale \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Humanscale M2.1 with M/Connect laptop docking station is an attractive, robust, and modern monitor arm that can expand your laptop\\u2019s connectivity without taking up additional space on your desktop.\\nHumanscale\\u2019s entry-level M2.1 doesn\\u2019t include a laptop dock, but it\\u2019s designed to accommodate the M/Connect 3, which nestles snuggly into the base of the arm. Most home office shoppers will likely choose the M/Connect 3 USB Data Hub, which currently retails for $253 (on top of the M2.1\\u2019s base price of $356). The hub adds three USB-C ports and two USB-A ports. If you want even more ports, the $600 M/Connect 3 Pro Dock adds two more USB-A ports, two more USB-C, Ethernet, and two DisplayPort ports.\\nThe M/Connect 3\\u2019s added connectivity is an excellent way to expand the ports on a laptop. Its central location makes the ports easy to access and keeps them firmly located in a set position on your desk (as opposed to freestanding hubs and adapters, which tend to get shoved around, or off, a desk). It\\u2019s also a good alternative to a USB-C monitor. We like USB-C monitors, but packing connectivity into the monitor can make it difficult to access some ports, as most are located on the rear of the display.\\nConnectivity aside, the Humanscale M2.1 is a robust, if conventional, monitor arm. It can handle monitors between 5 and 15 pounds, which is enough to support the vast majority of widescreen monitors under 32 inches in size. It also has a \\u201csmart stop\\u201d feature, which lets users customize the amount of rotation the arm allows, and easy-to-use quick release joints that are handy when disassembling or moving the arm. The arm isn\\u2019t as smooth in operation as the Herman Miller Flo, but it remains easy enough to adjust.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tErgotron LX Dual Monitor Arm \\u2013 Best dual monitor arm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Prices Today:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n$405 at  Lenovo$415 at  Amazon$415 at  CDW \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTwo monitors are always better than one, and the same goes for monitor arms. It\\u2019s no surprise, then, that Ergotron\\u2019s LX Side-by-Side ranks as our best dual monitor arm. The Ergotron LX Side-by-Side pairs two LX monitor arms together on one mount. The look, feel, and specifications of each arm are close to its standalone sibling.\\nMonitor size is one exception: While the standard LX is rated for monitors up to 34 inches, the Side-by-Side\\u2019s arm is only rated for monitors up to 27 inches. The monitor arms aren\\u2019t long enough to fit two 32-inch or 34-inch monitors side-by-side. Vertical arrangements are also supported, though only if one of the two monitors is small (less than 23 inches diagonal).\\nLook and feel is otherwise similar to the standard Ergotron LX, and that\\u2019s why the dual monitor arm also earns a recommendation. The dual-monitor arm provides the same winning balance of build quality, adjustability, and smooth operation, and it\\u2019s backed by the same 10-year warranty. \\u00a0Pricing is a bit higher at $330, which is a slight savings compared to buying two LX arms individually.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWorkstream by Monoprice Dual Monitor Arm \\u2013 Best budget dual monitor arm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Prices Today:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n$99.99 at  Monoprice \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe same logic that applies to our favorite dual monitor arm also to the budget model, giving Monoprice\\u2019s Workstream Dual Monitor Arm a clear path to victory.\\nIn fact, the dual arm\\u2019s pricing is even more impressive. The Workstream Dual Monitor is four times less expensive than the Ergotron LX Side-by-Side. I\\u2019m a bit shocked by the quality Monoprice can offer at a $100 price point. Ergotron\\u2019s alternative is more attractive and easier to use, but is it four times better? That\\u2019s a tough call.\\nThe Workstream\\u2019s downsides are identical to standard model. Build quality is impressive for the price, but the arm is difficult to set up and not as smooth in operation. I\\u2019m also doubtful the arm is capable of handling two 20-pound monitors, as its spec sheets claim. Fortunately, 27-inch monitors (the largest this arm can handle side-by-side) usually weigh less than 10 pounds, so weight capacity shouldn\\u2019t be an issue.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHuanuo HNDS12 \\u2013 Best mid-range dual monitor arm\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Prices Today:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\u20ac94.89 at  Amazon DE$139.99 at  Amazon \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Huanuo HNDS12 represents a middle ground for shoppers who want an upgrade in quality but need to respect their budget.\\nEach monitor arm is almost all metal with only a small piece of plastic to provide cable routing. The arm also has gas springs capable of lifting up to 26 pounds of weight, which is enough to handle 32-inch widescreen and 34-inch ultrawide monitors.\\nThere\\u2019s one unusual feature: a USB hub. This includes two USB ports that are placed at the front of the arm base. Each of these will need to plug in to your computer, which might be a problem if you have a laptop with just a few ports, but it\\u2019s a functional bonus.\\nThe Huanuo HNDS12, like the HNDS6 (below), is a bit fiddly to set up. It has two clamps that need to be adjusted and roughly a dozen screws that need to be installed. The gas springs also require a bit of adjustment to reduce the force provide, at least when used with a 24-inch or 27-inch monitor.\\u00a0\\nStill, the HNDS12 is a good pick at its regular retail price of $140, which often drops as low as $110 when on sale. It looks attractive and offers plenty of force for holding larger monitors.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nMonitor arms that we don\\u2019t recommend\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHumanscale M8.1\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Prices Today:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n$545 at  Humanscale \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHumanscale is synonymous with high-end office furniture: The Freedom chair is something of an icon in executive offices across the globe. But Humanscale\\u2019s high-end office hardware is at times an awkward fit for a home office, as the M8.1 demonstrates.\\nThe Humanscale M8.1 looks similar to the M2.1, but it\\u2019s upgraded to handle monitors between 6 and 28 pounds (almost double the M2.1 in our list above). That\\u2019s enough to handle nearly any monitor available today, including large ultrawides like the Dell Ultrasharp U4025QW. The arm can also handle two monitors of the appropriate combined weight and offers a \\u201ccrossbar\\u201d to support them both on a single arm.\\nThat\\u2019s good, and useful, but pricing is an obstacle. The arm starts at $545, but the crossbar (required to use two monitors) ups the price to $686. The M/Connect 3 laptop dock is also available to the M8.1 but, of course, adds even more to the price. That\\u2019s a bit hard to accept when the Ergotron HX, which supports monitors up to 42 pounds, starts at $350, or $585 for the dual-monitor crossbar version. Ergotron\\u2019s alternative feels as sturdy, supports even larger and heavier displays, and is less expensive.\\nThe Humanscale M8.1 has features you won\\u2019t find on the Ergotron, such as an optional laptop dock and customizable arm rotation, and it\\u2019s a fine selection if price is no obstacle. In most cases, though, the M8.1\\u2019s price will be hard to justify.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHuanuo HNDS6\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Prices Today:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n$59.99 at  Amazon$67.99 at  Huanuo \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHuanuo\\u2019s HNDS6 is a budget dual-monitor arm that\\u2019s popular on Amazon (in fact, it\\u2019s listed as the best-seller in Computer Monitor Arms). It provides a reasonable level of quality at a low price but fails to unseat the Workspace by Monoprice Dual Monitor Arm on our list.\\nWe\\u2019ll begin with the positives, which, to be clear, outweigh the problems. The Huanuo HNDS6 carefully walks the value tightrope to deliver a decent dual-monitor arm at a typical price of $60 (which can dip below $50 on sale). The arm\\u2019s metal construction feels rigid and looks durable.\\nEach arm is rated to hold between 4.4 and 14.3 pounds. That\\u2019s not a lot: The Workstream by Monoprice arm is rated up to 20 pounds. Still, it\\u2019s enough to handle a huge majority of 24- and 27-inch monitors, and the monitor arms provided plenty of lift in our testing.\\nWe\\u2019re not a fan of the arm\\u2019s installation. It has two clamps instead of one unified clamp, which is strange, because the base of the monitor arm is one solid piece. There are roughly a dozen screws to install. And the included cable routing can prove hard to tighten once several cables are held within the routing.\\nThe Huanuo HNDS6 is a decent dual-monitor arm for the price and worthwhile on a discount (it was once sold for just $38). In general, though, we think the Monoprice Workstream Dual Monitor Arm provides more for a similar price.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nWhat to look for in a monitor arm\\nPurchasing a monitor arm is a bit different from purchasing most home office gear. A monitor arm, unlike a monitor, is a hefty, durable piece of equipment that never really goes obsolete. It must also support the specific functions you want out of the box, since upgrades and customization tend to be limited.\\nAdjustability and range of motion\\nThe range of adjustability and motion a monitor arm can offer is a critical but often overlooked feature. A monitor arm should adjust for height, tilt, swivel, and pivot\\u2014and it should do so without tools.\\n\\n\\nAll the monitor arms we recommend meet this standard, but some differences remain. Only some monitor arms provide 360 degrees of swivel, meaning the neck of the monitor arm can be rotated to any position. That\\u2019s handy if your desk is in the middle of your room since you can use the monitor from various positions.\\nMost inexpensive monitor arms ditch adjustability and stick with simple tension mechanisms that are secured by a screw. It\\u2019s inexpensive but fixes the monitor\\u2019s position in place once it\\u2019s adjusted. We recommend avoiding mounts that use this strategy.\\n\\nEase of installation and adjustment\\nNone of the monitor arms tested were difficult to install, but the difference between budget and premium models was clear. Budget models require more screws to install, and the default tension of the arm\\u2019s adjustment mechanism is less likely to be suitable out-of-the-box.\\nThe ease of adjustment varies greatly, too. All the monitor arms we surveyed require an Allen wrench to adjust tension (which is necessary if the arm seems too stiff or loose), but some were much more difficult than others. The Herman Miller Flo felt smooth and effortless, while the Workstream by Monoprice required serious torque.\\n\\n\\nCable management\\nProper cable management is important if you value a clean, clutter-free desk.\\nThis is one aspect of design that didn\\u2019t improve with pricing. The Herman Miller Flo\\u2019s cable management was basic, while the Workstream by Monoprice hid cables well. This did come with a trade-off, though, as the Flo\\u2019s seemed least likely to cause cables to bind while moving the monitor.\\n\\nWhile cable management is useful, none of the monitor arms I tested can handle the full complement of cables that might be attached to a high-end USB-C monitor (like the Dell U3223QE). This is an aspect of monitor arm design that manufacturers could improve.\\nMaximum supported size and weight\\nIt\\u2019s important to buy a monitor arm that can handle the monitor you own.\\n\\n\\nThis won\\u2019t be a major concern if you own a 24-inch or 27-inch monitor, as most such monitors weigh 10 pounds or less. With that said, it\\u2019s wise to double-check the monitor\\u2019s weight before buying a monitor arm. Remember the monitor\\u2019s weight can exclude its stand. Larger 32-inch, 34-inch, and 49-inch monitors are more difficult to handle and may require an upgrade to a \\u201cheavy duty\\u201d monitor arm.\\nMonitor size limits should be respected as well. It might be possible to attach a 40-inch monitor to an arm meant for a 32-inch monitor. The 40-inch monitor may even come within the arm\\u2019s weight limit. A larger monitor will distribute weight differently, however, which could cause an arm\\u2019s tension mechanism to fail.\\nHow we test monitor arms\\nEvery monitor arm we recommend was personally tested first-hand at a PC World contributor\\u2019s home or the PC World office. We examine the quality, ease of installation, and range of adjustment of each arm to verify it meets the manufacturer\\u2019s claims. The monitors we use to test arms can vary over time, but generally include at least one 27-inch and one 32-inch widescreen monitor. Monitor arms rated for \\u201cheavy duty\\u201d use were tested with at least one monitor that weighs 20 pounds or more.\\n FAQ \\n1.\\nIs a monitor arm worth it?\\n\\nWhether a monitor arm is worth the price is subjective, but we believe our recommended monitor arms are worth making the investment. A monitor arm is easier to use than a stand, allows a wider range of adjustment, and keeps your desk clear of clutter. They\\u2019re also durable\\u2014there\\u2019s a good chance you\\u2019ll replace a monitor before the monitor arm.\\n\\n\\n2.\\nAre monitor arms compatible with my monitor?\\n\\nNearly all monitors, and nearly all monitor arms, use the VESA mounting standard. The 100x100mm bolt pattern is by far the most common, though 75x75mm is sometimes used as an alternative. All the monitor arms we recommend support both bolt patterns.\\nNot sure that your monitor supports VESA? Check the rear of the monitor. The VESA mount can be found in the center of the monitor, and the bolt pattern can be verified with a ruler or tape measure. This is likely beneath the neck of your monitor\\u2019s stand if you have one attached.\\nIt\\u2019s possible to mount a monitor that lacks a VESA mount, but you\\u2019ll need to purchase a VESA adapter. It\\u2019s a large, X-shaped device that clamps to the rear of the monitor.\\n\\n\\n3.\\nAre monitor arms compatible with my desk?\\n\\nMost monitor arms offer two mounting options: clamp and gromet.\\nA clamp mount is the most common for home office use. A U-shaped clamp fits over an edge of your desk. A screw mechanism is used to secure it. Most clamps are adjusted by hand and fit a wide range of desks. It\\u2019s important to double-check a monitor arm\\u2019s specifications if your desk is more than an inch thick, as some clamp mounts are too small to work with a thick desk surface. The clamp also requires an edge that\\u2019s free of obstructions on both the top and bottom of the desk.\\nGrommet mounts insert into the circular cut-outs found on many desks built and sold for corporate offices. A grommet mount is also a form of clamp, but size of the mechanism is different, and the mount attaches the monitor to the interior of the desk instead of an exterior edge.\\nNearly all monitor arms ship with a clamp and grommet mount, but grommet mounts are less common. It\\u2019s wise to double-check that a grommet mount is supported if that\\u2019s how you plan to mount the monitor arm.\\n\\n\\n4.\\nWill a monitor arm damage my desk?\\n\\nIt\\u2019s possible that a monitor arm\\u2019s clamp mount, if used, will cause minor damage to your desk. It may scratch the desk\\u2019s surface when mounted or removed, and over-torquing the clamp might cause a dent on some softer desks, such as those which use a veneer over particleboard. A glass desk can also prove troublesome\\u2014refer to the desk\\u2019s manufacturer to make sure it\\u2019s safe to use a monitor arm.\\n\\n\\n5.\\nDo monitor arms wobble?\\n\\nA quality monitor arm will tame minimal monitor wobble, though some might come through if the arm is mounted to a thin, light desk. Make sure to mount the monitor arm to a secure surface and adjust the arm\\u2019s tension to a level suitable for the monitor you\\u2019ve mounted.\\n\\n\\n6.\\nShould I buy a $25 monitor arm on Amazon?\\n\\nA monitor arm\\u2019s price tag can intimidate budget shoppers. Most budget monitors sell for $200 or less. Spending another $150 to $300 for a monitor arm can seem hard to justify.\\nStill, we encourage shoppers to avoid cheap monitor arms found on Amazon and other retailers. The least expensive monitor arms lack a dynamic tension mechanism, like a gas piston or spring. A few arms in the $35 to $50 range use a gas piston, but it\\u2019s often a wimpy example barely sufficient for holding a 27-inch monitor.\\nInexpensive monitor arms also lean more heavily on plastic. That\\u2019s not necessarily a problem out-of-the-box, but plastic tends to become brittle over time, which may reduce the lifespan of a monitor arm.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\t\\tAuthor: Matthew S.

It\\u2019s moving into a third-floor, 10,700 square-foot space at Lincoln Square South as part of the Bellevue Collection development.\\n\\u201cOur venue takes the party game concept to new heights,\\u201d Mirra founder Sam Wang said in a press release. \\u201cWe\\u2019re merging VR technology with a vibrant social scene to create unforgettable events.\\u201d\\nWang founded Mirra in 2020 in Bellevue. His previous positions include a stint as a general manager at the visual effects studio Phenom Films and co-founding the VR startup Skylimit Entertainment Group, both located in Beijing.\\nAt Mirra, attendees can play multiple VR games that the company has developed in-house, with a focus on party games for a variety of skill levels. The games are intended for adults, but can be played by families with children.\\nAn individual player at Mirra uses a VR headset to participate in any given game. As they play, their actions are broadcast via a holographic avatar to a nearby giant 8K LED screen wall.\\nThe idea is that each game is immersive for its participants, while also being fun to watch on the big screen for attendees who are still in actual reality. Mirra\\u2019s launch lineup includes dancing, treasure hunts, hockey, and a variety of other activities presented in a game show format.\\nIn addition to its VR games, Mirra features a full kitchen and bar, interactive technologies for attendees, and 8K LED screens throughout the venue that display multiple different environments.\\nThe current plan is that Mirra will be an all-ages venue until 6 p.m. After that, it shifts to become a 21-and-over nightclub until it closes at midnight.\\nGeekWire has reached out to Mirra to get more details about the venue, and we\\u2019ll update when we hear back.\\n\\n\\nTrack all of GeekWire\\u2019s in-depth startup coverage: Sign up for the weekly startup email newsletter; check out the GeekWire funding tracker and venture capital directory; and follow our startup news headlines.\\n Thomas Wilde has been working as a journalist and editor in the gaming press since 2002, most notoriously as the editor for DoubleJump Books.

From my view, I'm staring at a 120-inch display projected two feet in front of me thanks to a meticulous arrangement of light and mirrors within the Viture One's XR Glasses.View at AmazonInstead of transmitting you into a virtual or augmented reality like Apple's Vision Pro, the Viture glasses simply extend from -- and are powered by -- the source they're connected to, serving as an ultraportable, on-your-face monitor. To be clear, comparing the XR Glasses to a $3,500 productivity wearable is an apples-to-oranges affair. Unless you consider yourself an early adopter, the target customers of the two gadgets are notably different.Viture is pitching its glasses to people who want to game, watch movies, or surf the web without needing to be physically in front of a TV or office desk. The glasses' 120-inch projection is more suited for folks who would rather binge-watch shows while lying in bed or are on a flight and seek privacy when using a phone, tablet, or laptop. But the overlap in use cases is uncanny and not unintentional.Also: I've tried Vision Pro and other top XR headsets and here's the one most people should buyMy use case slots right in between: I want a larger platform to draft news and reviews and answer secretive emails as I sit in the make-believe comfort of public transit. The glasses are also practical for when your partner wants to watch The Bachelor on the living room TV, but you're more interested in the marriage of basketball and the spirit of competition.    A mock-up of what it looks like to wear the Viture glasses. Kerry Wan/ZDNETThanks to the single USB-C cable needed to power the device, I can easily pair the Viture glasses to my MacBook or Android phone. Bonus points if the latter is a Samsung Galaxy that supports DeX mode or a Motorola handset that supports Ready For; in those two platforms, you'll be greeted with a desktop interface of your usual mobile apps and services.Also: I demoed Xreal's AR glasses for spatial computing and they're better than I expectedHere's the killer feature of the Viture glasses: Spatial video support, the same 3D playback capability as found on the Vision Pro. While an adapter is necessary for the glasses to pair with an iPhone, the company has developed a new SpaceWalker app on iOS that lets users watch spatial videos recorded by an iPhone 15 Pro or Vision Pro. I played a couple of clips that I had previously reserved for the Apple headset, and reliving those moments with such depth and realism was quite eye-opening.Of course, there's no standard of spatial video playback quality for me to compare with, but based on what I saw, the essence of the format was there. I could see the separation between the subjects in the videos, and that remained consistent so long as my camera was well-distanced and in focus.    You can also watch 3D videos and movies on the Viture One XR Glasses. Kerry Wan/ZDNETAs far as the visual experience of the glasses goes, it's adequate, but nothing groundbreaking. For prescription wearers like myself, there are two Myopia rotary knobs (think focus dials) on the top of the Viture One that can be adjusted to your vision. That means you don't have to, and shouldn't, wear the XR glasses over your existing pair. You also don't need to fork up $150 for tailor-made prescription lenses like you would with the Vision Pro.Also: The best VR headsets right now (and how Apple Vision Pro stacks up)I found the best way to calibrate this was to keep the opposite eye closed as I was tuning each side. However, finding the perfect focus will take some trial and error, and even when you think you've struck the right distance, the corners and edges of the 120-inch projection will remain blurry.\\u00a0That seems to be unavoidable due to how large but close the projections are to your eyes. For example, if you hold an object an inch from your eyes, you'll notice how difficult it is to focus on it.Still, Viture has integrated some clever mechanisms with the lenses, like a self-dimming electrochromic film that you can toggle on or off depending on how bright your environment is. It's basically a built-in projector shade and helps the most when you're using the glasses outdoors.    My best attempt at capturing what's shown when the glasses are worn. Kerry Wan/ZDNETViture partnered with Harman to develop and tune the side-firing speakers of the wearable, and I'm impressed. They remind me a lot of bone-conduction headphones where audio beams against the side of your head and into your ears. Since the speakers are lying against you, no one but you can hear the audio output, which adds to the privacy focus that the company is going for.\\u00a0Perhaps the biggest question with such wearables is whether or not they cause symptoms of dizziness and motion sickness. From my experience, which includes one- to two-hour stints, I never felt discomfort when using the glasses.\\u00a0Also: Apple Vision Pro review: Fascinating, flawed, and needs to fix 5 thingsI credit that to two factors: the lightness of the wearable compared to traditional headsets and the wearer's ability to retain spatial awareness. Remember, the glasses are not a standalone device with its own operating system. They're simply an external monitor reshaped into something more pocketable. And thanks to the transparency of the lenses, you'll never feel like you're drawn into another reality when you have them on.ZDNET's buying adviceAt the time of writing, the Viture One XR Glasses are selling for $299, and that includes the power adapter, a carrying case, and nose pads at various heights. For the price, I'd recommend these to traveling professionals, gamers, and those who want a more private but accessible display experience. The Viture One XR Glasses won't beat the Meta Quest 3 or Apple Vision Pro, but they bring enough to the table to ease any FOMO you might have as more expensive headsets hit the market.Featured reviews    \\n\\n          I went hands-on with Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6 and it made my OnePlus Open feel outdated\\n         \\n\\n          One of the best soundbars I've tested is not made by Bose or Sonos\\n         \\n\\n          Samsung Galaxy Ring hands-on: Why I'd ditch my Oura for this competing wearable\\n         \\n\\n          Samsung's new Copilot+ PC is one of the best that I've tested\\n            \\n\\n            I went hands-on with Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6 and it made my OnePlus Open feel outdated\\n           \\n\\n            One of the best soundbars I've tested is not made by Bose or Sonos\\n           \\n\\n            Samsung Galaxy Ring hands-on: Why I'd ditch my Oura for this competing wearable\\n           \\n\\n            Samsung's new Copilot+ PC is one of the best that I've tested\\n           Editorial standards  Show Comments  \\n          Log In to Comment\\n         Community Guidelines     Related   \\n      I returned my Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 for these XR glasses - and they're 30% off for Prime Day\\n      \\n      These XR glasses gave me three virtual MacBook screens to work with - and they're 20% off for Prime Day\\n      \\n      The RayNeo Air 2 XR glasses are 31% off for Prime Day\\n              ZDNET we equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.

Augmented reality graphics and virtual sets have long held that promise, but historically local call-letter stations have found the technology to either be too difficult to implement or not realistic enough to viewers to get significant traction. That mindset is quickly changing, however, due to significant improvements in the realism of AR graphics and virtual environments, including both green screen and LED-based sets, as well as better integration with legacy production workflows.\\nThe improved usability of AR/VR for everyday news and sports production was the key takeaway from \\u201cVirtual Sets, AR and the News,\\u201d a recent TVNewsCheck webinar moderated by this reporter (watch it here). Top broadcast engineers and AR/VR software and hardware vendors described how the technology is being used on a regular basis by both local stations and national networks.\\nSolid Weather Forecast For VR At KPIX\\nKPIX, the CBS owned-and-operation station in San Francisco, has been using a virtual set for weather presentations in its daily newscasts since last September. The virtual set, which runs on Zero Density software and Epic Games\\u2019 Unreal Engine rendering, relies on a spacious green-screen background that curves onto a green floor, both painted with special ChromaLight paint. It allows KPIX meteorologists to walk across a 3D topographical model of San Francisco Bay and clearly depict the oft-stark differences in weather conditions between different parts of the greater Bay Area, which has roughly 15 microclimates, said Jeff Jeandheur,\\u00a0KPIX director of broadcast operations and engineering.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cIt became a really unique way to bring the weather story into a new volumetric environment,\\u201d Jeandheur said. \\u201cWe started it with the evening primetime show and it very quickly made its way into all of our newscasts, and that\\u2019s how we\\u2019ve been doing it since last September.\\u201d\\nKPIX meteorologists run the virtual set through a touchscreen interface on an iPad, with an WSI controller on the flip side of it that they use to pull up AR graphics like a seven-day forecast that appears in a series of clear tubes. The meteorologists can also trigger more traditional weather graphics like weather maps, which appear in virtual LED monitors.\\n\\u201cThey\\u2019re driving all of that,\\u201d Jeandheur said. \\u201cFrom the control room standpoint, it was really just taking a different source, which was the output of our Zero Density system that composited everything.\\u201d\\nThe virtual set has proven reliable and surprisingly easy to use, he added, and as such its use has occasionally spread to other segments in KPIX newscasts. A particularly compelling example was using the virtual set to illustrate the proposed raising of the San Francisco Ferry Terminal by seven feet to address rising sea levels due to climate change. Another was displaying immersive 360 video for a story on California\\u2019s Redwoods forest.\\nThe set has also been used for special coverage of the Grammys and the 2024 Super Bowl, as well as four hours of live coverage of the March 5 political primaries. Jeandheur said that new virtual environments for those shows were able to be created in less than a week, and sometimes within a matter of hours.\\n\\u201cYou can paint it faster and render the story faster than you can paint a real set,\\u201d he said.\\nLate last month, the KPIX virtual set took to the national stage with the launch of a new \\u201cwhip-around\\u201d show on CBS News 24/7, CBS\\u2019s streaming network, which covers breaking news from around the world. CBS is using the KPIX set for the 1 p.m. ET edition of the show, also called CBS News 24/7, with a 10 a.m. ET edition originating from another virtual set in New York.\\nThe new show features a virtual wall of video in the background that is continually being fed by the CBS network and CBS affiliates. The hosts, Vladimar Duthiers in New York and Reed Cowan in San Francisco, stand on the virtual floor and pop in and out of stories by pointing to a feed on the wall, which then cues a switch to a live feed.\\nA New Look At WCVB\\nHearst Television\\u2019s ABC affiliate WCVB Boston updated its flagship Chronicle, the longest-running locally produced newsmagazine show in the U.S., this past January with the launch of its own virtual set. The green-screen environment, which has a similar curved wall-into-floor configuration as KPIX, uses Pixotope software with Unreal Engine rendering and set design from Devlin Design Group.\\n\\n\\n\\nSince its 1982 debut Chronicle has always been on the cutting edge of technology, said Kevin Kalia, WCVB director of engineering, including first producing in HD back in 1999. When WCVB was seeking to enhance the program, using a virtual set to replace a hard set dating back to 2007 was attractive, even though the station didn\\u2019t have any previous VR experience.\\n\\u201cIt gave us the opportunity to do something that we wouldn\\u2019t be able to do with a physical set at all,\\u201d Kalia said. \\u201cIf you watch our program, it looks like a very large space, we have multiple storytelling locations within the virtual set. The textures, the lighting, all of these things would be very difficult if not impossible to pull off, not just in our studio but probably in most studios around the country. It\\u2019s been very successful, and it\\u2019s been well received by our audience.\\u201d\\nKalia said that virtual sets \\u201caren\\u2019t quite plug-and-play yet,\\u201d and so the WCVB engineering and production staffs spent several months last fall working with vendors to iron out technical details including optimizing its rendering engines, inputting camera tracking data and integrating live video feeds. It also played around with different finishes to cut down reflections from its anchor desk, the one \\u201chard-set\\u201d piece in the new space.\\n\\u201cWe spent a couple of weeks, maybe even a couple of months, fine-tuning our rendering engines and working on optimizing the set model,\\u201d Kalia said. \\u201cBecause now we\\u2019re working in Unreal, as I think most of us are, and it\\u2019s not just a matter of what you see is what you get. You have to make it work in a way that it\\u2019s going to perform across the rendering platform. You have to build it with an eye towards efficiency and make sure it looks the way you want it to look.\\u201d\\nMaking AR/VR Easier\\nThe three biggest areas of improvement in virtual set technology are camera tracking; higher-performance, standardized rendering; and tighter workflow integration with legacy systems like graphics and production automation, said Mike Paquin, senior product manager, virtual solutions, Ross Video.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn terms of being able to use virtual sets for everyday news production, tracking is perhaps the most crucial.\\n\\u201cIf you go back 10, 15 years, a lot of the headaches that people remember in doing tracking in a virtual set was that you had to calibrate almost every show,\\u201d Paquin said. \\u201cIf you lost power, if you had to move a camera, all of a sudden you had to recalibrate, you couldn\\u2019t do a show that day. Now all of that tracking is either done with optical tracking, so the markers in the ceiling [such as Mo-Sys\\u2019 StarTracker], or with the robotics, they\\u2019re all absolute. So, when you power it on, even if you turn it off and move it, when it comes back on it\\u2019s all still in relative space, so there\\u2019s no recalibration. You\\u2019re not going to be stuck without doing it.\\u201d\\nMost virtual set vendors, including Ross, are using Unreal Engine today to create photorealistic graphics. Paquin said that standardization has also made implementation much easier compared to the early days of virtual sets, when each vendor used its own rendering engine with its unique quirks and limitations. Adopting Unreal has also provided broadcasters with a large labor pool of graphic artists that have honed their skills in other industries, such as architectural design.\\nBut Unreal still needs to be customized somewhat to make it perform efficiently for broadcasters, he added, which is a task that Ross has taken on for its customers.\\n\\u201cWhat we do is we help broadcasters essentially pare down the engine,\\u201d he said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s a super-powerful engine, it\\u2019s built to do gaming and all sorts of interactions, but there are a lot of things you have to do for performance. You have to build it for live production, so bringing in live inputs, bringing in the data integration, the weather stats. We build the tools to help do that, making it easy to use every day, not just something you want to do on a film set or something you spend months and months building and use it once.\\u201d\\nMaking it easy includes building tools for MOS integration, which allows Ross\\u2019 Voyageur virtual set to tie into Ross OverDrive for automated production control or integrate with Ross or third-party graphics systems. Ross has also integrated tracking for its robotic camera systems, Paquin said. All of that workflow integration means that stations no longer need a dedicated team of people to simply operate the set.\\n\\u201cNow the tools are there so you can integrate it with your switchers or your other graphics systems and make it so it can be used every day, and you don\\u2019t need to have a small team of people that that\\u2019s all they do,\\u201d he said.\\nVirtual Learning For TelevisaUnivision\\nOne broadcaster that Ross is currently working with on virtual set implementation is TelevisaUnivision, which operates a 20-station group in the U.S. [Univision Local Media] along with a bevy of broadcast and cable networks across the U.S. and Mexico. TelevisaUnivision was looking to use AR and VR to improve local news production at its stations, including the \\u201cability to dynamically change fast,\\u201d said Ruben Robledo, TelevisaUnivision SVP production operations.\\nWhile TelevisaUnivision\\u2019s sports properties regularly use green-screen virtual sets today, the local stations had only scant experience with AR and none with virtual sets. So, Robledo and the TelevisaUnivision projects team set up a proof-of-concept (POC) at the company\\u2019s San Antonio station to learn on the fly.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u201cWe went to San Antonio and built it, and we got very good learnings,\\u201d Robledo said. \\u201cOne of them was that it didn\\u2019t change a lot from the control room back for us, which is kind of weird. I was expecting something different, but it was not. At the end of the day, the camera sees a studio. But there are changes for the people in the studio, the anchors, the people trying to position themselves in this environment that doesn\\u2019t exist. So that was really, really good for us.\\u201d\\nAfter successfully doing test productions over several months in San Antonio, Robledo is now overseeing the construction of a green-screen virtual set at its station in Phoenix as part of a comprehensive technical upgrade of that station. He hopes to replicate the model across the rest of the group in the future.\\n\\u201cWe\\u2019re in the middle of it, and hopefully this is the first one of many more to come,\\u201d Robledo said.\\nNew Opportunities With LED\\nWhile the broadcasters on the panel were all using green-screen virtual sets, networks like ESPN and Eurosport are employing walls of high-quality LED monitors as virtual backgrounds, noted David Jorba, VP of business development, Disguise. While LEDs have higher upfront implementation costs than green screens, Jorba said LEDs are easier to use and provide greater versatility for a range of production applications.\\n\\n\\n\\nThat includes the ability to create a parallax effect with virtual graphics shown on a large LED display, as ESPN does with the \\u201cdepth wall\\u201d on its hard set for SportsCenter, or to bring in live video feeds to facilitate face-to-face interviews with remote guests. Jorba thinks LEDs should be more seriously considered by local stations who are exploring VR.\\nDisguise also works with green screen environments, with customers including NBC as well as TelevisaUnivision\\u2019s sports networks. But Jorba said that making sure talent\\u2019s hair and clothing looks good, as well as their lighting, can be difficult when chroma-keying in a green screen environment. And a green-screen set can only support virtual or chroma-key applications, while LEDs can be used in a variety of ways.\\n\\u201cThe Disguise systems control the lighting, the camera tracking, the LED processors,\\u201d Jorba said. \\u201cThey\\u2019re controlling the whole environment, so you can program the system to go from one set to another by just pressing a button. That means in the morning you can do a show with just video playback and image playback as with the traditional LEDs you all have in your stations. Then in the middle of the day you can bring some augmented reality to it to do some storytelling, then later on you can do parallax like we do with SportsCenter. And then at night you can do a full XR [extended reality] set.\\u201d\\nTechnology\\nAbout Glen Dickson\\n\\nGlen Dickson has over 25 years of experience working in the media industry, most of it spent writing about the technology behind broadcast and cable television.

He called it the \\u201cMetaverse,\\u201d borrowing the term from the 1992 Neal Stephenson sci-fi novel Snow Crash. Since then, the metaverse has become increasingly synonymous with Meta, and most laypeople \\u2014 if they understand it at all \\u2014 assume that partaking in it means wearing a virtual reality headset so that we can spend all our time in a colorful, corny-looking 3D world, where we all live as avatars resembling Pixar characters.Three years later, consumers haven\\u2019t exactly been jumping into it. Meta spent $46 billion on its Reality Labs division during that time but it only produced about $6 billion in revenue. And sales have been flat or declining since 2021. Has the metaverse died before it even arrived?Not so, says Matthew Ball, the CEO of Epyllion, a diversified holding company that makes angel investments, provides advisory services, and produces TV, films, and video games. Ball, formerly the Head of Strategy for Amazon Studios, has been writing about the metaverse for years, even before the term exploded into popular lexicon. In his 2022 bestselling book, The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything, he explained in detail that the metaverse is much, much more than a 3D world independent from our own. And it will not belong to one single company: it is the next evolution of the internet itself. We won\\u2019t be living in the metaverse; it will be all around us. And yes, it will change everything.But so much has happened since Ball\\u2019s book was first published. Generative AI seems to have supplanted the metaverse as investors\\u2019 (and even Meta\\u2019s) primary focus. Cryptocurrency has grown more mainstream, despite weathering multiple exchange failures. Apple has released its Vision Pro in pursuit of \\u201cspatial computing.\\u201d\\u00a0Thus, Ball has revised and updated the book. The Metaverse: Fully Revised and Updated Edition: Building the Spatial Internet, arrives July 23rd. Freethink spoke with Ball to discuss, among other things, why the metaverse\\u2019s current situation is reminiscent of the internet\\u2019s past, and why it is still likely to be the internet\\u2019s future.The following interview has been edited for length and clarity.RP: What are some popular misconceptions about the Metaverse?MB: I think that there are three primary misconceptions today. One is that it really is isolated to Meta\\u2019s view of the metaverse. When Meta changed its name, nearly all of the products designated as for the Metaverse were virtual reality only, despite the fact that they are working on augmented reality glasses and have a series of different wearables. But the inability to see and touch these products led to quite a bit of conflation.The second area of conflation tends to stem around crypto and blockchains. This largely is due to the fact that many in the crypto community use the term \\u201cWeb3.\\u201d We have these parallel visions of the future emerging around the same time around 2021 that both use the word \\u201cthree\\u201d: the metaverse, a 3D medium, and Web3 a new version of the internet in contrast to today\\u2019s Web2. There are many in the metaverse community that view Web3 technologies such as blockchains as essential to constructing the metaverse. There are others who believe they\\u2019re not essential but they are likely to produce the most collectively prosperous version of the metaverse. And there are those who believe it\\u2019s a totally inessential technology. And yet many in the public believe them to be the same thing.\\nThe last misconception is that we will spend most of our lives inside VR headsets.\\nThe last misconception, and this is perhaps the most important, is that subscribing to the metaverse means believing that we will spend most of our lives inside VR headsets, removed from the world around us. The internet has myriad expressions, different experiences, different content, but it\\u2019s an underlying technology which enables scores of different devices, experiences, content, and interactions. The metaverse is best described as a 3D augmentation of that which can be experienced through VR, mixed reality, through traditional 2D interfaces, and often passively through digital twins and autonomous vehicles.RP: So the way you\\u2019re describing it, the metaverse is really just the next evolution of the internet. I\\u2019m curious how online human interactions will change compared to current online interactions. People behave pretty terribly on the internet today. Do you think human behavior will change for the worse, for the better?MB: There\\u2019s a product that is expected to be deployed later this year called Starline. Starline is essentially a version of a traditional telepresence booth. It\\u2019s produced by Google. It actually creates a 3D avatar of you that is hyperrealistic. I\\u2019ve used this technology. It\\u2019s utterly remarkable. You can see hair falling down from someone\\u2019s hairline. They can eat an apple and you see every aspect of this apple. Now why do I talk about this? When Starline is tested, we see remarkable advances in human behavior and experiences. There\\u2019s a roughly 30% increase in nonverbal forms of communication, and we see a 20% increase in memory recall and up to a 40% increase in eye contact. We do know that these technologies will show substantial benefits to human existence.I\\u2019ve used this technology. It\\u2019s utterly remarkable.RP: I recently spoke to a professor who was concerned that the internet is reducing in-person interactions to the point that younger generations are not developing their theory of mind properly \\u2013 their ability to see others as having mental agency. Do you think that interacting within the metaverse could reverse this trend?MB: We have abundant data now showing how screen time, especially with the young, can adversely affect brain development, behavior, and socialization. More broadly, we\\u2019re cognizant of many challenges in the digital era \\u2013 data privacy, data literacy, security, mis- and disinformation, radicalization, toxicity, abuse, harassment, isolation \\u2013 and there are many ways in which the 3D internet is likely to improve those conditions, but there are doubtless many ways in which it will make many of the current problems harder.\\u00a0RP: When you originally wrote the first version of your new book, the Metaverse was all the rage for investors and Big Tech. Now, companies seem to be shying away from the term metaverse. In a recent essay, you mentioned Apple\\u2019s strict use of \\u201cspatial computing\\u201d and Nvidia\\u2019s \\u201cOmniverse.\\u201d The title of your updated book even refers to the metaverse as the \\u201cspatial internet.\\u201d\\u00a0Why do you think companies are turning away from \\u201cmetaverse\\u201d?MB: Metaverse is so inextricably linked with Meta, and to a lesser extent virtual reality, that any company who deploys the term is often perceived as subscribing to the same vision of the future as Meta, and perhaps worse, trying to catch up and compete. So that\\u2019s why we see Nvidia using a trademarked term in \\u201cOmniverse.\\u201d Roblox, an original pioneer in using the term metaverse, has dropped the term altogether. And then separately you have a company like Apple which has always tried to strike a chord with new terminology.\\u00a0RP: A widely read piece in 2023 declared the Metaverse dead and described it as \\u201carguably one of the most historic failures in tech history.\\u201d I assume you think this conclusion is dead wrong. Can you explain why?MB: I think the best way to respond to it actually came from Tim Sweeney, the founder and CEO of Epic Games, which makes Unreal Engine, perhaps the most important simulation technology globally. He quote-tweeted that piece and said that a wake should be held for the metaverse, and in attendance should be all 600 million people per month that participate in it. His point was to sum up the number of people that are using Roblox, Fortnite, and Minecraft \\u2013 these networks that truly span hundreds of millions of unique worlds.\\nIt\\u2019s like saying no one has any interest in social networking because they don\\u2019t use Google+.\\nThe piece that you\\u2019re referring to was primarily contrasting the size of Meta\\u2019s investments in VR hardware with the struggles of its hardware to see much user adoption, and actually, the subordinate struggles of its own virtual world, Horizon. Now, to characterize the performance of the metaverse with Meta is already wrong, but to suggest that consumers have no interest in the metaverse based on the success of Meta\\u2019s own virtual world service would be like saying no one has any interest in social networking because they don\\u2019t use Google+. You are effectively picking the 20th-ranked service to characterize the overall trend.RP: In your book, you compared the Metaverse today to the internet in 1995. What do you mean by that?MB: In 1995, the world population was around six billion. You\\u2019ve got tens, approaching 100 million people by the end of the decade who have gone online, but they\\u2019re not online often. When we\\u2019re looking at the \\u201890s, the internet was predominantly leisure oriented, obscure, niche, and had yet to really proliferate into industry or commerce. You didn\\u2019t really do work on the internet; you exchanged communications on it.\\u00a0Of course, decades later, nearly every aspect of that has changed, and that\\u2019s how we should look at the metaverse. True, the metaverse has proved harder and taken longer to produce than anticipated. The relevant technological constraints relating to both mixed reality headsets as well as the changes to the internet required to support the metaverse have been way harder holistically. And yet we should think of this as a progressive transformation, one that is definitively underway.\\u00a0RP: In your book, you mention that building a head-mounted device to provide wide access to the metaverse could be the \\u201chardest technology challenge of our time.\\u201d Can you delve more into this statement?MB: The challenges relate to many different factors. One is that we\\u2019ve found out the specifications for a minimum viable product are higher than anticipated. So, for example, we talk about the incidence of nausea that many experience with a virtual reality device. We have discovered that most of this nausea goes away when you reach an 8K or 16K resolution and when you go from a 90 frame rate refresh to 120 or 240. Just to put it in basic terms, the avoidance of nausea means producing a display that has at minimum twice and potentially 16 times the pixels of the giant TV you have on the wall, and each one of those pixels needs to be generated up to ten times more, all of this on a device that fits on your head and has a portable battery.The second challenge relates to the difficulty of pulling this off. The more pixels you have, the more battery you need, the more powerful a processor you need. The larger, the harder working the battery, the larger, the harder working the processor, the more heat you\\u2019re generating. And this is a device worn on your face, inches from your eyes. The tradeoffs required to pull this off \\u2013 it\\u2019s hard. We have a good sense that the cost to produce these devices is in the tens, if not 50 to 100 billion dollar level. It\\u2019s a sum that seems ludicrous to many, and yet, we have ample proof from the Android and iPhone that if you can operate and develop the dominant computing system for the world, that produces one of the most powerful, protected, and lucrative businesses in human history. Apple is doing roughly $400 billion dollars a year, the foundation of which is the iPhone.RP: So the metaverse is a new \\u201cmobile computing\\u201d opportunity, potentially even much larger. It\\u2019s a brand new platform, not just a toy or a new virtual world to inhabit. It\\u2019s a new economy.MB: That\\u2019s quite right. The examples are actually manifold. Nine of the ten largest oil and gas companies have publicly affirmed their use of VR headsets. An executive at one of them told me a little bit more about how they use them. Oil and gas offshore platforms are among the most dangerous working environments in the U.S. They average about 35 deaths per 100,000. These VR headsets are being used to improve training, to familiarize these individuals to this extraordinarily unfamiliar and complex environment.\\u00a0Back in 2020, the first live patient surgery was performed in the U.S. using a mixed reality device. The physician who performed the surgery likened it to using GPS in the 1990s. I like this example for two reasons. Number one, we think of GPS not as a substitute for driving and experiencing the world but as an accomplice. And the second is that GPS in the \\u201890s was primitive. It has now become a platform that enabled the construction of services such as Tinder, Uber, and DoorDash.I believe deeply in the potential of these technologies as do many of the largest companies on Earth, and the belief is that it\\u2019s a fundamentally better way to experience and to interact with digital information. When the sufficient hardware and tools are available, remarkable things will be built on top of it.RP: When we get to what you call a \\u201cfull-spec\\u201d metaverse \\u2013 rich, immersive experiences, the true 3D spatial internet \\u2013 what will be the energy, material, and bandwidth requirements for that sort of technology? Will it even be able to reach its full potential? Could infrastructure be a limiting factor?MB: We have no idea, partly because we don\\u2019t know enough about what we will want to do in it. I use this example from John Carmack, the founder of 3D, later the CTO of Oculus. In 2000, if you told him with 1,000 times modern computing power, could you build the metaverse? He said yes. He\\u2019s now realized we\\u2019re nowhere near able to do it. We have learned over the last 40 years of the internet that we always need more bandwidth, we always need more computing power just to do the things we know we want to do in the near future. And we do that because we have proven ourselves woefully incapable of understanding what we will use those resources for, how significant the products of those resources will be, and how frequently we will need them. More importantly, we can\\u2019t fathom the intersection between those various products and what they build anew.Advances in AI are essential to the construction of the metaverse.RP: Since your book was initially published in 2022, generative AI has undeniably supplanted the metaverse as Big Tech\\u2019s primary investment focus. This seems to suggest that the two technologies are competitive. However, in your updated book, you argue that they\\u2019re complementary, and you outline six ways AI will enable, accelerate, and steer the metaverse. Can you briefly describe them?MB: It\\u2019s unquestionably true that, in many areas, AI is competitive in investments with the metaverse \\u2013 on a dollar basis, on an attention basis, and on a talent basis. But it\\u2019s also true that advances in AI are essential to the construction of the metaverse and will accelerate its emergence.\\u00a0I can reduce those six examples into three. The first is hardware and physics. During our discussion we talked about some of the ways in which the reality of head-mounted devices or the requirements of computing power and bandwidth far exceed what we have available today. AI is helping to path through that problem, partly by predicting our needs to reduce the load.The second is to recognize that the construction of the metaverse is today extraordinarily costly. We\\u2019re talking about virtualizing nearly every aspect of the physical world. But we are seeing companies producing tools that with only a few dozen photographs can virtualize an environment, using neural networks to assume information that it doesn\\u2019t know but with high accuracy. Roblox has talked about the fact that within four more years, anything you want to create will be possible semantically. You can speak an entire world into existence.The third area is populating the metaverse itself with artificial intelligent agents that we can interact with.RP: A final question. We talked earlier about how the metaverse is really Meta\\u2019s term. Apple favors \\u201cspatial computing.\\u201d If you had to come up with a term yourself for this new 3D internet, what would you call it?MB: I don\\u2019t know what I would call it. What I will tell you is that I have a reasonably high degree of confidence that the most likely characterization is the \\u201cinternet.\\u201d The second most likely is probably the \\u201c3D internet.\\u201dRP: So you think that the metaverse will simply be the future of the internet?MB: Yeah, mobile is a pretty good example of that. While the mobile internet is generally understood, most people don\\u2019t think about the internet in the context of the device that they access it. They don\\u2019t say \\u201cI\\u2019m on the mobile internet\\u201d or \\u201cI\\u2019m on the WiFi internet.\\u201d It\\u2019s just access to the internet.When you talk to most people on metaverse platforms today, like Roblox, you find generations where 75% of children aged 9-12 use Roblox, a single metaverse platform, each week. Essentially none of them know what the metaverse is. Fewer know that Roblox uses the term metaverse. And fewer still are probably interested in understanding what that is.\\u00a0To them, it\\u2019s part of life and they\\u2019re growing up using it.

But the new browser-based experience that replaces it is leaps and bounds ahead of what we had before, so you won\\u2019t miss the old streaming method.The Netflix app was one of the few streaming apps you could download on Quest, but it was flawed (to put it politely). There was no passthrough support to watch in mixed reality, and streams were capped at 480p (standard definition, or SD).Prime Day deals are here - shop our expert picksWhile the app had its supporters they were few and far between, and the Netflix app was deemed by many, us included, as a waste of digital library space. So it came as no surprise that Netflix would come up with a different strategy for supporting the Quest 3 \\u2013 ditching the app completely and instead bringing its streaming service to the Quest browser.We\\u2019ve tested it out and the difference is night-and-day. Streams are now a significantly crisper 1080p (full-HD), and you can choose to watch Netflix content in mixed reality or in your virtual home environment. What\\u2019s more you can move the window around to position it for comfortability or multitasking, you can view on a curved or flat screen and resize the display as required, and you can dim or brighten the environment to make it feel more or less like you\\u2019re watching in your own private VR movie theater.It\\u2019s turned Netflix-in-VR from a niche oddity to a genuinely great example of the tech. Now we just need other streaming platforms to follow suit.The first step for VR streamingIt\\u2019s worth noting you can use the browser to watch content from other best streaming services \\u2013 like Disney Plus \\u2013 but when testing these other platforms there was a noticeable dip in quality compared to Netflix.\\u00a0Apple's Vision Pro is much better for VR video (Image credit: Apple)The darkened cinema-like experience remains (as that\\u2019s a feature of the browser itself) but the picture quality is grainier, perhaps due to the services not offering the same level of browser support as Netflix.\\u00a0Get daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inboxSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.Contact me with news and offers from other Future brandsReceive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsorsBy submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over.What\\u2019s more, while browser-based experiences are generally fine it\\u2019s not a perfect solution, even on the Netflix side of things. Primarily because you can\\u2019t download shows or films to watch offline \\u2013 say, when you take your next flight. This was lacking in the original Netflix VR app too, but now it\\u2019s a feature that might be impossible to implement unless the platform creates a new dedicated app.Apps for Disney Plus and Prime Video on the Apple Vision Pro do support downloads, so perhaps they\\u2019ll keep this functionality when they get a Quest 3 port (although who knows if that\\u2019ll happen).\\u00a0Meta hasn't made video content as much of a focus for Quest as Apple has with the Vision Pro, but if the Netflix experience proves popular we could see it invest more in that aspect of VR. We'll just have to watch this space.You might also likeEven in VR, Taskmaster is way harder than I thought it would beApple Vision Pro finally hits the UK \\u2013 here's\\u00a0how you can try oneVision Pro at one \\u2013 I love Apple's revolutionary headset, so why do I hardly ever use it?\\n\\nHamish HectorSocial Links NavigationSenior Staff Writer, NewsHamish is a Senior Staff Writer for TechRadar and you\\u2019ll see his name appearing on articles across nearly every topic on the site from smart home deals to speaker reviews to graphics card news and everything in between.

This article has covered observations made by analysts at IDC and Omdia on the recent developments in the XR industry.\\nDespite a projected stagnation in near-eye display shipments for 2024, the long-term outlook for the market remains positive, Kimi Lin said in a recent Omdia report.\\n\\u201cWith advancements in display, optical, and other component technologies, Omdia is optimistic about the long-term outlook. Near-eye display shipments are projected to grow rapidly from 2027, reaching 92.9 million units by 2030,\\u201d stated Kimi Lin, Senior Research Analyst at Omdia.\\nThe global display industry is set to convene at the Omdia Display Conference from September 12-13, 2024, in Shanghai, China. During the event, Kimi Lin and a team of Omdia analysts will present their research on the latest innovations within the display sector.\\nXR market\\nThe XR market, which includes AR, VR, and MR, is currently facing a downturn, causing significant layoffs at leading companies and prompting several smartphone brands to halt or scale back their XR projects. Despite these setbacks, industry leaders are determined to rejuvenate the market and drive growth in the coming years, Omdia said.\\nFor instance, Microsoft announced layoffs primarily targeting its mixed reality (MR unit, responsible for the HoloLens 2 AR headset.\\nTechnology major Google is cutting hundreds of jobs in its AR (Augmented Reality) hardware and voice assistant businesses, according to reports.\\nAnother tech giant Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs in 2023.\\nChina-based ByteDance-owned virtual reality (VR) headset maker Pico is conducting a new round of\\u00a0job cuts\\u00a0in line with a restructuring.\\nThe latest IDC report said global shipments of augmented reality and virtual reality (AR VR) headsets fell 67.4 percent in the first quarter of 2024 as the market is transitioning to include new categories such as Mixed Reality (MR) and Extended Reality (ER).\\n\\nThe average selling price (ASP) of AR and VR headsets rose to over $1000 as Apple entered the market and incumbents such as Meta focused on premium headsets such as the Quest 3.\\nVirtual Reality headsets are forecast to reach 24.7 million units by the end of 2028, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.2 percent as the consumer base slowly grows beyond core gaming use cases and as businesses adopt more headsets for training, design, and more.\\nAugmented Reality headsets will grow from a smaller base of less than a million units in 2024 to 10.9 million in 2028, representing an 87.1 percent CAGR over the same period, Jitesh Ubrani, research manager,\\u00a0Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers\\u00a0at IDC, said.\\nGrowth plans\\nMeta and PICO plan to launch the Quest 3S and PICO 4S in the second half of 2024, both at lower prices than their predecessors to stimulate sales. Meanwhile, Sony\\u2019s PlayStation VR2 (PS VR2) will now support PC VR games, expanding beyond its previous PS5 exclusivity, which is anticipated to boost PS VR2 sales, Omdia said.\\nIDC report on share of AR VR vendors Q1 2024\\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms has announced the initial release of its XR operating systems to third-party OEMs, including ASUS, Lenovo, and Microsoft Xbox. Meta will also focus on enhancing the quality and quantity of its platform and application software to improve hardware terminal sales.\\nIn 2024, the XR market\\u2019s primary focus will be on the Apple Vision Pro. Its high price is expected to limit its sales, preventing it from significantly boosting overall market growth.\\nOmdia predicts that total XR set shipments in 2024 will remain steady compared to 2023, with near-eye display shipments also flat at 17.2 million units. Nonetheless, the Vision Pro has significantly increased the share of OLED on silicon (OLEDoS) displays.\\nThe XR industry is expected to remain stagnant for the next one to two years. While set shipments will experience slight fluctuations, near-eye display shipments are projected to increase more significantly due to the inevitable shift from single to dual displays.\\nBaburajan Kizhakedath\\nTweetShareSharePin\\n\\nPrevious articleEricsson posts 7% drop in sales to $5.7 bn in second-quarterNext articleTPG Telecom and Optus network sharing deal faces review in Australia\\n\\n\\nLatest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTelenor reveals 3% growth in revenue in Q2 after price hike\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTSMC boosts revenue and Capex forecast amid AI chip demand surge\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSamsung dropped to third in India smartphone market\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nNokia Q2 2024 sales indicate significant drop in telecom Capex\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSamsung Researcher HyoungJin Choi named Chair of ITU-R Coordination Group on 6G\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore like thisRelated\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSamsung dropped to third in India smartphone market\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 18, 2024 \\n\\nThe latest Canalys research report has revealed two interesting...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nUK regulators probe Big Tech\\u2019s growing influence in digital payment\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 16, 2024 \\n\\nBritish regulators are investigating the increasing use of digital...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nApple sale in India reaches $8 bn in 2023-24 fiscal\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 15, 2024 \\n\\nApple has generated sales of almost $8 billion in...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSmartphone market growth and leading vendors in second-quarter\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 15, 2024 \\n\\nIDC and Canalys have shared the growth trends in...\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nABOUT US\\nPARTNERSHIP\\nPRIVACY POLICY\\nCONTACT US\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNews website for 4G, 5G, Statistics, Telecom Services, Internet, Broadband, Broadcast, Network, Chips, and Smartphones.\\n\\n\\nFacebookLinkedinTwitter\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nABOUT US\\nPARTNERSHIP\\nPRIVACY POLICY\\nCONTACT US\\n\\n\\nThe latest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTelenor reveals 3% growth in revenue in Q2 after price hike\\n\\n4G LTE\\n\\nJuly 18, 2024 0 \\n\\nTelenor has announced notable achievements in terms of revenue...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTSMC boosts revenue and Capex forecast amid AI chip demand surge\\n\\nSemiconductor\\n\\nJuly 18, 2024 0 \\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world\\u2019s largest contract...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSamsung dropped to third in India smartphone market\\n\\nSmartphone\\n\\nJuly 18, 2024 0 \\n\\nThe latest Canalys research report has revealed two interesting...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a9 2024 Kizhakedath Media Services.

It's All About the GPU\\u00a0Laptops that rely on their processors' integrated graphics are useless for VR apps. Check the specs: If your laptop uses Intel HD Graphics, UHD Graphics, Iris Graphics, Iris Xe Graphics, or Intel Arc Graphics (without a model number), it's integrated. Just as when shopping for a gaming laptop or a mobile workstation, your priority must be a discrete or dedicated GPU, and a powerful one. Even avid gamers are often satisfied with a GPU capable of showing 60 frames per second (fps) on a laptop screen or desktop monitor, but on a headset that frame rate can at best look choppy and at worst cause nausea\\u2014a sustained 90fps is more comfortable.\\u00a0(Credit: Molly Flores)The two major pioneering (and now discontinued) VR headsets, the Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive, recommended at least an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or an AMD Radeon RX 480 for tolerable performance in VR. Officially, things haven't changed much\\u2014the advanced, pricey Valve Index specifies the GeForce GTX 1070, and the HTC Vive Pro 2 still only requires a GTX 1060. HP's Reverb G2 headset merely lists any DirectX 12-capable GPU, and a wide range of Quadro and Radeon Pro lines for workstations.You may be familiar with Meta's (formerly Facebook's) Meta Quest headsets, which are referred to as \\\"standalone\\\" since they don't need to be connected to a PC to operate, given their internal hardware guts. They do have an optional cable to use them with your PC for gaming, though, and any GeForce GTX 16-series, or RTX 20-, 30-, or 40-series GPU is supported. (See Meta's list of supported GPUs here.)You won't find those exact chips in modern gaming laptops, though; they have been surpassed. Nevertheless, our advice is to aim higher, at the very least to the neighborhood of the mobile GeForce GTX 1660 Ti (if you can still find one) on the Nvidia side and the Radeon RX 5500M for AMD-based laptops\\u2014or, better yet, a newer GeForce RTX or a Radeon RX series solution.\\u00a0Those GPUs may be the minimum needed to run the headsets, but more demanding games will need better GPUs to run well, just like they would outside of VR.(Credit: Zlata Ivleva)This probably means you won't get away with spending much less than $1,000 on a gaming laptop. In the sub-$1,000 ballpark, you'll likely be torn among options like an RTX 3050, an RTX 3050 Ti, or an RTX 4050, with a relative smattering of Radeon RX 6000-series machines tempting those on Team Red. Of course, if you can spend more, you can get a truly powerful GPU. Among Nvidia's offerings, stepping up to a GeForce RTX 4070, RTX 4080, or RTX 4090 will help you run games at much higher frame rates, even at maximum settings, which may make the difference between a dizzying experience and avoiding motion sickness altogether. For games that are particularly demanding outside of VR, an upper-tier RTX 40-series GPU is recommended.What Processor and Memory Do I Need for VR?\\u00a0Outside of the graphics card, component hardware requirements for VR are easier to hit. As far as the CPU goes, the Vive Pro 2 lists an Intel Core i5-4590 or equivalent. That's a quad-core desktop processor that Intel introduced in 2014, which, needless to say, you won't find in any new desktops or laptops today.The same goes for that Meta Quest Link cable that connects a Quest headset to a PC to play games like Half-Life: Alyx. The minimum for AMD CPUs is equally light\\u2014the Ryzen 5 1500X, a desktop quad-core that dates back to 2017.\\u00a0The HP Reverb G2 lists a minimum requirement of any Core i5, i7, or Ryzen 5, while the Valve Index requires a dual-core CPU as a bare minimum, but recommends four cores or more. This is all to say anything CPU-wise sold in a modern gaming laptop is going to do the job just fine.(Credit: Molly Flores)What to know when looking at CPUs: While four processing cores are a necessity (and six or eight cores naturally better still), any modern (from 10th Generation on) Intel Core i5 laptop chips, or AMD Ryzen 5 4000 or 5000 series ones, will be fine for even the latest VR apps. A Core i7 or a Ryzen 7 will give you ample headroom for future software, and the latest generations of these chips will run games smoothly when paired with the right GPU.\\u00a0What's nice: You'd be hard-pressed to find a current- or previous-generation gaming laptop that won't meet any of those CPU minimums across these headsets. Gaming laptops almost universally use one of Intel's or AMD's H-series CPUs, which are higher-powered processors than the U-series silicon in most thin non-gaming laptops, and a minimum of four cores. Any late-model Core i5, i7, or i9, or a Ryzen 5 or 7 H-series chip, should do the job nicely for VR. (For a much deeper dive, see our guide to understanding laptop CPUs.)As for system memory, the Vive Pro 2 asks for 8GB, as do Meta headsets and HP's Reverb. Since every current gaming laptop comes with at least 8GB of RAM and plenty include 16GB, you won't have to go out of your way for sufficient memory or processing power, unless you're shopping for a used laptop.Which Ports Does My Laptop Need for VR?\\u00a0Being able to plug in all of your headset's required connectors is the main concern here, and realistically more of a limiting factor than the CPU or GPU in your gaming laptop, given the modest spec requirements. Modern VR headsets don't hog three USB ports as the original Oculus Rift did (it required cables for the headset, as well as two wired sensors), but you'll still need to be careful about your new laptop's selection of ports. Knowing which ports you'll need requires checking the fine print.\\u00a0One laptop may be a good fit for one VR headset, but not have what you need for another, so make sure to check the laptop against the specific cabling needs of the VR headset you're using.(Credit: Molly Flores)The Meta Quest 2 and Quest 3's optional Oculus Link is a fancy USB Type-C 3.2 cable, but other headsets like the Vive Pro 2 and the Valve Index require both a USB 3.0 port and a DisplayPort video connector to work with a PC. The HP Reverb G2 asks for a DisplayPort 1.3 and a USB Type-C port.The DisplayPort is critical because many laptops, as mentioned, have an HDMI output but no DisplayPort. An adapter that links a full-size DisplayPort to a mini DisplayPort will work (and is sometimes included with the headset), but an HDMI-to-DisplayPort adapter\\u2014and this is very important to note when shopping\\u2014will not. (We haven't tried a Thunderbolt-to-DisplayPort adapter, but we wouldn't count on it. You want the \\\"real deal\\\" ports to match.) Note that many laptops, gaming and otherwise, now implement the DisplayPort output as a protocol (as opposed to a physical connector) over one or more of the USB-C ports; this can work, but make sure you get the right cables to match.Fortunately, several gaming laptops and some content-creation laptops do have DisplayPort connectors, but triple-checking the necessary mix of ports before you buy a laptop for VR is essential. If you have ports left over beyond what's required, you can chalk that up as a win, since it will allow you to keep other peripherals plugged in alongside the headset without swapping cables.\\u00a0Other VR Laptop Concerns: Screen, Storage, and Battery\\u00a0After meeting the VR hardware requirements, other factors come down to your personal preferences and needs. You'll find 14-inch, 15.6-inch, 16-inch, and 17.3-inch laptops compatible with popular headsets (with some goliath 18-inch models emerging), but of course, you'll wear your headset while playing, not looking at the screen. The display size you pick should depend on how you use your laptop when you're not using VR.\\u00a0(Credit: Molly Flores)Our laptop buying guide will walk you through the pros and cons of different screen sizes. If your work is mostly confined to your desk, a 17.3-inch or even 18-inch notebook is a plus, though some can weigh a barely luggable 8 pounds or more. (Also see our guide to the best 17- and 18-inch laptops, VR-ready and not.) If you'll often take your laptop on the go, a lighter 15.6-inch system makes sense. (Again, check that it has the ports you need; the more compact the machine, the fewer ports it's likely to have.) In addition to the screen size, you'll want to assess the display characteristics, notably the peak refresh rate; modern gaming laptops use panels with faster refresh rates than most older models. (See our guide to whether you need a high-refresh screen.) All laptops have their distinct visual styles as well, ranging from businesslike bland to gamer garish. The difference is subjective, but you don't want to be stuck looking at something you don't like. For example, Alienware machines tend toward flashy; most Gigabyte machines look much more conservative.(Credit: Zlata Ivleva)VR games and apps take up a lot of storage space, so you'll want a machine that can at least hold your favorite titles while letting you rotate others out. Teaming up a speedy solid-state drive (at least 512GB, preferably 1TB) with a larger hard drive is a popular solution. If the laptop of your dreams has room for only one SSD without a supplemental hard drive, buy the highest-capacity SSD you can afford.\\u00a0Battery life is generally less of an issue for gaming and VR laptops than for ultraportables and convertibles because gaming laptops are usually plugged in. Playing on battery rather than AC power usually diminishes performance, and VR is so power-hungry that you'll rely on a wall outlet for all but the shortest explorations.\\u00a0Ready to Buy the Right Laptop for VR?\\u00a0The systems outlined here represent the best VR-ready laptops we've reviewed.

While some frames cater to open-ear audio or AI assistance, AR smart glasses like the VITURE (pronounced \\u201cvihh-chure\\u201d) Pro XR act like portable monitors \\u2014 capable of projecting a large virtual display perfect for gaming or watching TV and movies.There\\u2019s plenty of AR glasses competition from brands like Rokid, XREAL, and RayNeo. However, VITURE\\u2019s combination of quality hardware and easy-to-use software has typically seen the brand labeled as the most well-rounded offering on the market \\u2014 although that does come hand-in-hand with being one of the more expensive options available. Do the company's latest Pro XR smart glasses continue to impress? Let\\u2019s find out.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: DesignWhile smart glasses can come in a range of designs, with the Solos AirGo 3 particularly excelling when it comes to frame diversity, most AR/XR smart glasses attempt to style themselves on the classic Wayfarer style \\u2014 though this look is only authentically available with the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.However, VITURE has captured the essence of Ray-Ban\\u2019s iconic frames pretty well while making obvious adjustments to house the tech within. These glasses very much feel like they might be the Wayfarers of tomorrow. Chunkier temples feature open-ear stereo speakers and an action button and volume rocker on the underside of the left arm.VITURE's Pro XR Glasses are styled like a gently futuristic redesign of Ray-Ban's iconic Wayfarer sunglasses. They're a little chunky in places, and fall victim to the same \\\"floating off your face\\\" look that other AR glasses do, however, they remain comfortable even over long spans and don't look half bad when worn. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)A similar increase in bulk is found across the top of the frames, which is needed to make room for each eye\\u2019s bottom-firing micro-OLED display projections \\u2013 and sadly maintains the quirky \\u201clifting off the face\\u201d look that many AR glasses suffer from. These projections land on secondary, prism-like lenses found behind the main electrochromic film lenses, which can be activated with a single press of the action button to block out up to 99.5% of external light and enhance immersion while in use.The prism-like secondary lenses may take some getting used to at first, and while there\\u2019s a clear visual definition between the two, it can be jarring. Eventually, your eyes tune out their presence \\u2014 though their surface is much more reflective than the main lenses. This can manifest some distracting mirroring in brighter environments while the glasses aren\\u2019t in use or the display is anchored to the corner of your sight.Unlike other AR glasses that require sometimes costly lens inserts for vision adjustment, VITURE's Pro XR glasses include twin myopia adjustment dials to ensure you can see the virtual displays with crystal clarity without your regular prescription lenses. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)Two myopia adjustment dials, also present on the chunkier front frames, aid those with nearsightedness. These dials allow you to fine-tune the focus for each eye (0.0D to -5.0D) and ensure you\\u2019re getting the most crisp results possible from the virtual displays.Finally, these lightweight (77 grams) frames feature a proprietary magnetic pin connection at the end of the right temple tip, which allows hassle-free connection to the glasses\\u2019 USB Type-C data cable, which connects to your device of choice.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: SetupIf you want to use VITURE Pro XR glasses with home or handheld consoles like the PS5, Nintendo Switch, Asus ROG Ally, or Steam Deck, you\\u2019ll need to invest in the VITURE Pro Mobile Dock.Using the glasses themselves is simple. Connecting the aforementioned USB Type-C cable to the right temple tip and any compatible device (Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, featuring a USB-C DisplayPort/DP Alt Mode-supporting port) instantly activates screen mirroring as the glasses\\u2019 micro-OLED projectors kick in.You don\\u2019t need to worry about drivers or software with this use case. The VITURE Pro XR smart glasses essentially act as a plug-and-play monitor. However, this will only result in a static virtual display with little to no customization available for positioning the screen or engaging in 3DoF (Three Degrees of Freedom), AR-like interactions.The VITURE Mobile Dock allows you to unleash the true potential of your handheld console/gaming PC by presenting the same large-picture virtual displays and providing 13,000 mAh of additional charge to your device. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)If you want to use VITURE Pro XR glasses with home or handheld consoles like the PS5, Nintendo Switch, Asus ROG Ally, or Steam Deck, you\\u2019ll need to invest in the VITURE Pro Mobile Dock ($129). This accessory unlocks 3D content support and acts as a docking station (that allows two VITURE smart glasses to be connected simultaneously and HDMI connections) and a portable power bank with a 13,000 mAh battery.\\u00a0VITURE Pro XR Glasses: SoftwareTo use those more advanced visual features, you\\u2019ll need to download and install the SpaceWalker app. SpaceWalker is available for iOS/iPadOS, Android, and now Windows, giving users a spatial sandbox that includes a web browser and media player. While that doesn\\u2019t sound like much, it is enough to be able to make use of web versions of apps like YouTube, Netflix, and Prime Video.The benefit of doing this through SpaceWalker is that VITURE\\u2019s app also allows for 3DoF tracking, allowing you to turn away from your virtual screen or more comfortably view content. SpaceWalker also allows media or web pages to be clipped to the corners of your view and scaled in size to suit your needs.This can let you prepare and cook a meal while following along with a video tutorial that doesn\\u2019t impede your full vision, or catch up on some YouTube videos while getting around town without worrying about bowling over the locals because your entire field of vision was being taken up with \\u201cMemes for the Boys part 62.\\u201dSpaceWalker for Windows and macOS unlocks a more familiar spatial computing experience, where the Pro XR's headtracking is put to use to add an extra dimension to your virtual displays with full 3DoF rendering. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)SpaceWalker for macOS is a whole other ballgame. Here, you\\u2019ll be able to engage in a much truer spatial computing experience. Connecting the VITURE smart glasses to a MacBook running SpaceWalker unlocks a multitude of virtual display options, including stunning ultrawide 21:9 floating displays and the ability to shrink and grow the scale of displays with ease.The Windows version of SpaceWalker has only recently been released and can be a little buggy at times. However, it\\u2019s safe to expect that VITURE will bring the app up to speed in the coming months.There\\u2019s no current rival to VITURE\\u2019s offerings on the software front, at least not from smart glasses manufacturers themselves (though there are some excellent pieces of third-party software available online). While XREAL has the most similar offering in terms of design, style, picture, and audio, VITURE is one of the only AR smart glasses companies to deliver such compelling, widely-supported, easy-to-use, and impactful software.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: DisplayAR glasses like VITURE\\u2019s use an interesting projection method to present virtual screens before your eyes. Rather than the image appearing directly on the lens, two Sony micro-OLED panels beam an image into a secondary lens that redirects each image toward your eyes.The result is quite impressive, to say the least. With a bright, 135-inch virtual panel before you at all times. There\\u2019s a full-HD (1920 x 1080) per-eye resolution to enjoy with refresh rates of up to 120Hz \\u2014 which is especially excellent for speedy, responsive gaming through the glasses.The Pro XR's twin lenses can be hard to adjust to at first, vision through the glasses won't ever be 100% comfortable when you're not making use of the micro-OLED displays, but it's by no means impossible to acclimatize to. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)One downside to the AR glasses form factor is that your FoV (Field of View) is more restricted than when using a VR/AR headset like the Meta Quest 3. The Pro XR glasses have a narrower 46-degree FoV, resulting in a more tightly packed area from which you can view the projected image. In contrast, the Quest 3\\u2019s pancake lenses offer a much larger 110-degree FoV, offering over twice the screen space with which to enjoy content.Pictures are bright and crisp, and whether I was watching movies or playing games, I never felt the glasses lacking in visual quality or performance. Better still, watching 3D content on the glasses is absolutely stunning and simple to perform. Simply holding down the action button on the left temple switches to SBS (Side-by-Side) vision, allowing the full 3D experience in games and media.Capturing the virtual displays through the lenses is a tricky task, and this picture by no means does the unwarped, crisp, and clear presentation of the virtual screens any justice. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)The VITURE Pro XR smart glasses are excellent for gaming. They deliver speedy refresh rates and capture the striking and varied colors of CD Projekt Red\\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077. The enormous virtual display pulls you further into titles, and your immersion is peaked when you enable the electrochromic lenses that block out the surrounding light almost entirely.\\u00a0VITURE Pro XR Glasses: AudioThe VITURE Pro XR\\u2019s audio's open-ear design lets you enjoy media or games without shutting off the rest of the world. The Harmon-tuned audio is definitely rich in quality, and the audio bleed is very well-contained.Setting the glasses down while playing a range of music videos and movies at peak volume, I lost track of much of the audio at only a few feet in distance. This makes them ideal for commutes or on-the-go watching, as you won\\u2019t be annoying those around you by unwantedly blaring the contents of your watchlist in their general direction.The open-ear speakers housed within the Pro XR's temples offer excellent audio, though they do fall short against other AR glasses when it comes to maximum volume. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)However, that\\u2019s likely because the VITURE Pro XR\\u2019s speakers are relatively quiet compared to others. The XREAL Air 2 glasses are also open-ear in design but offer much more of a kick, making them better suited for noisier or less isolated environments. This does, however, negatively impact the frames when it comes to audio bleed.All in all, the Pro XR\\u2019s speakers strike a fair balance and are more than enjoyable while at home or in less bustling locations. For those who want to dial things up to 11, there\\u2019s always the option to switch over to a pair of Bluetooth earbuds or headphones.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: Price and availabilityThe VITURE Pro XR smart glasses are available for $549, though currently discounted to $459 for early adopters.At face value, that\\u2019s a sizeable sum for a pair of high-tech shades, though it\\u2019s not an uncommon price for smart glasses of its ilk. The $399 XREAL Air 2 AR glasses offer similar features, but options like the VITURE Pro XR\\u2019s electrochromic film lenses are reserved for the more expensive $449 Air 2 Pro model.VITURE's Pro XR Glasses (front) are a step up from XREAL's Air 2 AR glasses (rear), offering an electrochromic panel that can be activated to blank out all but the brightest of lights and greatly improve immersion. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)However, XREAL\\u2019s offerings lack the myopia adjustment dials of VITURE\\u2019s glasses, leaving some glasses wearers needing to rely on potentially expensive lens inserts to see the virtual displays clearly.Of course, at that price, it\\u2019s worth considering the expanded functions and capabilities of VR/AR headsets like the $499 Meta Quest 3. That being said, the improvements to the overall AR experience from the Quest 3 will come at the cost of a bulkier, heavier, and less welcoming form factor.\\u00a0Bottom lineVITURE\\u2019s AR smart glasses offering is a well-rounded assortment of accessories and software that pushes the AR/XR experience that frames like this can deliver. There\\u2019s truly no smoother or fleshed-out experience as the one offered here \\u2014 at least for now.Forget spatial computing. Pick up a pair of VITURE's Pro XR glasses and give facial computing a try instead.My only major gripe is that the complete experience is costly. VITURE\\u2019s frames alone have an intimidating price tag to some, so having to invest even more to get the most from your handheld or home console may be asking too much of general consumers.However, as a plug-and-play pair of AR smart glasses, the core product is still considerably impressive, thanks to the awesome SpaceWalker software available across mobile and desktop platforms.Yes, the AR experience is a little more expansive and impressive through the lenses of a VR/AR headset. However, they're far less accommodating when it comes to comfort or wearing while out and about. As such, unless you're looking to take advantage of VR/AR gaming, forget spatial computing. Pick up a pair of VITURE's Pro XR glasses and give facial computing a try instead.More from Laptop MagWhat are smart glasses?

For Amazon Prime Day the company is offering 30% off the glasses and discounts on key accessories:\\u00a0Viture One Glasses: $299 (more than 30% off)Viture One Dock Pack: $379 (more than 30% off)Viture One Duo Pack: $689 (more than 30% off)Viture Mobile Dock: $89 (more than 30% off)Viture One Cloud Pack: $499 (nearly 20% off)Viture One iPhone 15 Pack, $380 (more than 20% off)Viture One Lightning iPhone Pack, $388 (more than 20% off)Also:\\u00a0The best Prime Day deals: Live updatesAlthough I've tried multiple VR devices in the past (Google's Daydream and Samsung's phone-based VR products) I hadn't been fully convinced of the usefulness of VR for my own purposes. It wasn't until I saw the reviews of the Apple Vision Pro that I decided to further explore the AR/VR/XR options that could optimize my work and play environments. It took testing three different products and a handful of software updates until I was finally convinced that there is indeed a product that could improve my productivity while also helping me enjoy some down time.My work commute includes almost 45 minutes of train riding each way with limited tablespace to get work done. I also travel at least once monthly for work with a laptop as my primary computer. Work in my home and business offices is optimized by two external displays, so commuting with just a single small laptop display is a challenge for me to work on.Review:\\u00a0Apple Vision Pro: Fascinating, flawed, and needs to fix 5 thingsI also like to watch movies and YouTube videos while traveling, something I have done (like most people) for decades on my mobile devices.  But today there are better options out there that simulate the big screen experience, so I figured it was time to try out some new technology. Unfortunately, it wasn't to be. Why I returned the Apple Vision ProI previously detailed my productivity experiences with the Apple Vision Pro before ultimately returning the headset to Apple. I would have kept it to test future software updates, but I value my marriage of more than 30 years and wasn't willing to lose my spouse for $4,300. The major productivity concern was the limit of one MacOS display shown virtually. For someone used to working with multiple screens, this was unfortunately a dealbreaker.  For now, at least.\\u00a0      Matthew Miller/ZDNETWhy I returned the Meta Quest 3Even though ZDNET awarded the Meta Quest 3 its  best product of 2023 award, up to this point I hadn't tried it. But  after learning that the Quest 3 supported multiple virtual desktop  displays, I went ahead and ordered a Quest 3 in an attempt to expand my  laptop work experience.Frankly, I was blown away by the Meta  Quest 3 and couldn't believe how close of an experience it was to  Apple's Vision Pro, despite the Vision Pro being seven times more  expensive. Gaming is clearly a focus of the Quest 3 and in this area it  far exceeds what Apple is currently offering, but ultimately, that  wasn't why I wanted to try it out.What I really wanted to see was how it handled the workplace. So, I  installed Immersed, Remote Desktop, and Meta Horizons Workroom on the  headset and on my MacBook Pro. Immersed and Meta Horizons Workroom both  provide three, or more, virtual displays via a wireless connection to  the headset and I was banking on this working well for my commuting and  business travel.However, just as I was confident that the Meta  Quest 3 was the headset for me,  the folks at Viture dropped SpaceWalker  for MacOS. I tried this out for an hour and was so impressed, I had to  fill out the return for for the Quest 3. Who knows, I may still keep it  around for home use since it still is fun to enter the VR space and  escape from reality from time-to-time.     Matthew Miller/ZDNETWhy I'm sticking with the Viture One XR glassesXR glasses are designed to provide you with a large virtual display, but in a lightweight sunglasses form factor. I first tried the XReal Air 2 Pro, but returned them after a few days because the visual clarity was disappointing, and I didn't find the Nebula software useful at all as it provided limited apps in a flashy VR form.\\u00a0With a 15-hour flight from LA to Brisbane coming up, however, I ordered the new Viture One XR glasses and Mobile Dock accessory and decided to give them a try. These are similar to the XReal Air 2 Pro, but I found them more comfortable and the optics worked better for me. The diopter dial above each eye was a game changer as it allowed me to use the glasses with and without my contact lenses on. They work with iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows, and gaming platforms like the Nintendo Switch.Also: 3 likely reasons why Quest 3 is more popular with users than other Meta VR headsetsMy long flights to and from Australia flew by with content I downloaded from Apple TV, Netflix, Amazon, and more, along with several games on my Nintendo Switch. The glasses are comfortable, lightweight, and powered by the devices providing the content. In terms of productivity, a single extended display was supported natively from my MacBook Pro and Surface Pro.\\u00a0This single extended display that requires periodic peeking under the glasses to see what's on the laptop offers little enhancement to me, since the high resolution display on the MacBook Pro is top-tier on its own, and better for when I need to get some serious work done. Thus, the Viture One XR glasses are best used for simulating a big screen entertainment from a phone or gaming console.     Matthew Miller/ZDNETBut the Viture One XR glasses still had some tricks up its sleeve. This week, SpaceWalker was publicly released for MacOS and it is a game changer for the Viture One XR glasses.  SpaceWalker is a companion software application that was first available for iOS with fairly limited functionality that was more of a VR technology demonstration rather than a practical application. It is also available now for Android phones, but you should also know that the Viture glasses support Samsung DeX for most Samsung phones.Also:\\u00a0Meta Quest 3 vs. Apple Vision Pro: How accurate was Zuckerberg's review?With SpaceWalker, I now have up to three virtual displays of my computer with settings present to optimize the experience. This function alone propelled the Viture One XR glasses to the top of my list for productivity, and combined with the media and connected gaming support, I am completely satisfied. In my opinion, the Viture One XR glasses ultimately beat out Apple's Vision Pro and the Meta Quest 3 in terms of usefulness across both productivity, gaming, and media applications. There is currently no version of SpaceWalker for Windows, but the ARMoni application looks promising and is next on my list of things to try out.

You won't need much to just play simple video on a VR headset, and even a high-end smartphone can deliver a basic VR experience, as mentioned in our intro. But things get more complicated if you want to power and run games in VR.First: A Look at the Headset SpecsTo create the VR experience, most HMDs utilize two displays\\u2014one for each eye lens. This helps to create the immersive illusion that makes VR what it is, but it is also a big part of what forces you to buy powerful PC hardware for VR. The hardware has to drive separate images for each lens, and this effectively doubles the workload.Valve's Index VR HMD, for example, has displays in each lens that have a resolution of 1,600 by 1,440, which is roughly equivalent to a 1080p monitor for each eye. Each display also operates at a 120Hz refresh rate. This makes rendering a game for the Index similar to trying to drive two 1080p monitors at 120Hz, which, even today, isn't so easy when you're dealing with demanding, graphically impressive game titles.This workload only increases with other HMDs, like the Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, and HTC Vive Pro 2, all of which have even higher-resolution displays. The new Meta Quest 3 has a resolution of 2,064 by 2,208 per eye, which gives each eyepiece a higher pixel count than a standard 1440p monitor and the two together display more pixels than a 4K display. This makes rendering games with peak visual quality on the Meta Quest 3 more demanding than gaming at 4K and limits you to using only the best available graphics cards if you want to avoid turning down the graphics settings. Older HMDs are less demanding, but those come at the cost of lesser image quality.What Your VR PC Needs: The Minimum SpecsNo matter which of these headsets you buy, you're going to need a relatively powerful gaming PC. If your PC isn't fast enough, you'll end up having to reduce image quality, which will make for a less immersive experience. At the bottom end of the requirements, you could also end up with an inconsistent refresh rate, which can be quite disorienting and ruin your VR fun.Intel's Core i5-13600K processor(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)For the most part, the hardware you'll want for VR gaming won't differ much from what you'd want for any modern gaming PC. A wide range of processors will work well for this task; AMD's Ryzen 7 5700X, AMD's Ryzen 7 7700X, and Intel's Core i5-13600K are some of the best current-gen options, though a CPU a generation or two older would be just fine. Indeed VR will work on CPU tech much older than even that. The minimum CPU/GPU requirements for the major headsets are as follows. Note that the Meta headsets are designed primarily as standalone devices, but can be hooked up to PCs for connected use with PC-centric VR games via the Quest Link accessory cable.Meta Quest 2 and 3, or Quest Pro (via Meta Quest Link cable)Intel Core i5-4590, AMD Ryzen 5 1500X, or betterNvidia GeForce GTX 1060/GTX 1650 Super, AMD Radeon RX 400 series, or betterHTC Vive Pro 2Intel Core i5-4590, AMD Ryzen 1500 equivalent, or betterNvidia GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD Radeon RX 480 or greater (GeForce RTX 20 series or Radeon 5000 series, or later, to operate in Full Resolution mode)Valve Index VRDual-core processor with Hyper-Threading (quad-core recommended)Nvidia GeForce GTX 970, AMD Radeon RX 480, or better (GTX 1070 or better recommended)The HMD makers generally cite a minimum of 8GB of main system memory, but it would also be best if you picked up 16GB of RAM, as well as an NVMe M.2 SSD to help with loading games faster.AMD's Ryzen 7 5700X processor(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)The graphics card requires a bit more consideration for a VR gaming PC. With a regular gaming desktop, playing ordinary games, turning down the resolution or even the refresh rate is always an option without incurring any serious negative consequences. This means you can game on any PC with just about any graphics card. Having a less-powerful graphics card in that situation only limits your game selection and how detailed and crisp your games will look.In VR, things are a bit different. As we mentioned earlier, inconsistent frame rates can ruin your VR experience. Don't downplay the necessity of that: Frame-rate smoothness matters a lot more in VR than it does in traditional gaming because judder and screen tearing while you're moving your head around in a virtual world can cause dizziness and nausea, and be a game-ender.Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4090 GPU(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)Both AMD and Nvidia have powerful graphics cards that are more than capable of driving a high-end VR experience. As you can see from the minimum specs above, a GeForce GTX card will do for VR basics; following from that, any of Nvidia's more powerful GeForce RTX GPUs are up to the challenge of gaming in VR. When you're shopping for a VR card, that means while you need to avoid very low-end or older cards, you necessarily don't have to spend to the sky. The older, \\\"Turing\\\"-based GeForce RTX 20 Series cards can still be found as more budget-friendly options, and the newer \\\"Ampere\\\"-based GeForce RTX 30 cards will more than suffice. With that in mind, the newest high-end cards, in the \\\"Ada Lovelace\\\"-based GeForce RTX 40 Series, will certainly do an even better job with higher-end HMDs, but they are overkill unless you can use the extra power for 4K or 1440p gaming outside of VR.AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XT GPU(Credit: Michael Justin Allen Sexton)Many of AMD's midrange and high-end cards from the last few generations are also up to the task. The older\\u00a0Radeon RX 5700\\u00a0and\\u00a0RX 5700 XT are some of the better budget options here, as their prices have dropped, though you could also benefit from the newer RDNA 2-based cards like the Radeon RX 6800 and RX 6800 XT. AMD's newest graphics cards, based on the RDNA 3 architecture, are (like the GeForce RTX 40 Series) if anything overkill for many VR HMDs. But if you want to be ready for the newest VR games of 2024, and game at very high resolution outside of VR, they are the best option.How High End a Graphics Card Should I Get for VR?To avoid issues with poor performance, you really need to shoot for a powerful graphics card that's up to the task of running modern AAA VR titles. Though it's hard to argue that any graphics card is too fast for VR, opting for a card like an AMD Radeon RX 6600 XT or an Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 Ti, at a minimum, is a good idea for high-end HMDs, even though their minimum GPU specs are much lower.If you've got more to spend, then there's no harm in going straight for some of the best cards on the market, like AMD's Radeon RX 7900 XT or Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4080 Super. (The RTX 4090 is awesomely fast, but awesomely expensive, too.) Both are extremely powerful, but that's the point. These will drive games in VR with ease and can run games at 1440p or 4K when you don't feel like playing in VR. If these high-enders are out of your price range, but you're still looking for something that's a step above the VR GPU baseline, the best middle-ground card is one based on the GeForce RTX 4060, or even the GeForce RTX 3060, if you can still find one on the market.You can always try to scrape by with lower-end cards, but this could leave you unable to run newer games at fast enough refresh rates for you to enjoy the experience. Depending on what games you intend to play, you certainly can do this. But if you're new to VR, which you likely are if you are here, it's best to aim for something like one of the cards we just mentioned to drive a high-quality experience and get the most out of your HMD, and your monitor, for when you're not in VR. (After all, no one can stay in there all the time.) \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompare SpecsThe Best Graphics Cards for VR in 2024Our Pick\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nZotac Gaming Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super Trinity Black Edition 16GB GDDR6X\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4090\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAMD Radeon RX 7900 XT\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Super\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAMD Radeon RX 7800 XT\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNvidia GeForce RTX 4060\\n\\nSee It\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAMD Radeon RX 7600\\n\\nSee It\\n\\nEditor's Rating 3.5 GoodReviewEditors' Choice 4.0 ExcellentReview 4.0 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.5 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.5 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.5 ExcellentReviewEditors' Choice 4.0 ExcellentReviewGraphics ProcessorNvidia AD103Nvidia AD102AMD Navi 31Nvidia AD104AMD Navi 32Nvidia AD107AMD Navi 33GPU Base Clock2340223920001980212418302250GPU Boost Clock2610252024002475243025052625Graphics Memory TypeGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6XGDDR6GDDR6GDDR6Graphics Memory Amount162420121688DVI OutputsHDMI Outputs1111111DisplayPort Outputs3323333VirtualLink OutputsNumber of Fans3232222Card WidthdoubletripledoubledoubledoubledoubledoubleCard Length12.11210.91010.598Board Power or TDP285450315220263115165Power Connector(s)12VHPWR4 8-pin (12VHPWR)2 8-pin12VHPWR2 8-pin1 8-pin1 8-pin\\nMore Inside PCMag.com\\nThe Best Graphics Cards for 2021\\nThe Best Graphics Cards for Compact PCs in 2024\\nThe Best Graphics Cards for 4K Gaming in 2024\\nThe Best Graphics Cards for 1080p Gaming in 2024\\n\\n\\nAbout John Burek\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI have been a technology journalist for almost 30 years and have covered just about every kind of computer gear\\u2014from the 386SX to 64-core processors\\u2014in my long tenure as an editor, a writer, and an advice columnist.

And I mean that word in a good way, because it's actually a useful one.Are the Xreal Air 2 Pro worth the $449 (\\u20ac515 in Europe), or should you stick to the more affordable $399 Xreal Air instead? Let's find out\\u2026Jump to:SpecsDesign, build qualityFit, comfort and adjustabilityControls and electrochromic dimmingImage quality: watching movies, gaming on the Steam Deck, working on an iPad, MacBookConnectivityXreal Beam, companion appSpeakersVerdictSpecsXreal Air 2 ProDisplay technologySony micro-OLEDDisplay resolution1080pRefresh rateUp to 120HzMax brightness500 nitsContrast100,000:1FOV (field of view)46\\u00b0Weight75 gramsDesign, build quality\\nThe Xreal Air 2 Pro come with seemingly the same carrying case as the base model, which is good news. It's a hard shell case, it's going to protect them well during travels, and closes with a strong, reassuring snap. Zero chance of it opening on its own, nor would it be easy to crush, even if you put all of your luggage on top of it, so again \\u2013 good stuff.As for the glasses, they look identical to the Xreal Air 2 \\u2013 good, minimalist matte plastic build, soft rubber nose pads, and they're comfortably lightweight, at just 75 grams.At a distance it's hard to distinguish those from normal sunglasses, which is always welcome, but at a closer look, people will start noticing.Because of their downward-facing mini-displays, plus the mirrors that reflect them towards your eyes, the frames of these glasses sit further away from your face than is normal, which can make them look a bit odd to others around you.Now that's been the case with pretty much any \\\"wearable display\\\" glasses we've reviewed, so it's not an exclusive issue with the Xreal Air 2 Pro, just something worth pointing out.Fit, comfort and adjustability\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nXreal Air 2 Pro (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nFor the most part, these are going to feel like a slightly thicker, but fairly traditional pair of sunglasses on your face.Because they're fairly light, and come with three sizes of soft rubber nose pads to choose from, you shouldn't have any comfort issues.Even better, the Xreal Air 2 Pro have adjustable frames, which you can snap between slightly different angles. It's important to play around with that feature, because at least for me, the frames' default angle didn't let me see the virtual screen in its entirety. I changed their angle a bit, and voila.In addition, we get a prescription lens frame that attaches to the glasses, should you need it.Controls and electrochromic dimming\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nXreal Air 2 Pro physical buttons (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nThe Xreal Air 2 Pro have simple and familiar physical controls. On the bottom of the right frame, we get two buttons for setting the brightness, and a single button to adjust these glasses' most notable feature \\u2013 the electrochromic glass dimming.Press that button once, and you can see through the glasses like you would through normal sunglasses. Press it a second time, and the glasses turn significantly more opaque, letting you focus on your content better. Press it a third time, and now the glasses are at their most opaque state \\u2013 it's much harder to see through them, which makes your content pop, and look extra bright.And, of course, if you want to completely block your view through the glasses, and just enjoy your digital content, the Xreal Air 2 Pro come with an attachable, fully opaque \\\"Light Shield\\\", which you can snap over the lenses.But I doubt you'll need it, as that electrochromic glass dimming is pretty strong on its own, and I love it.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nXreal Air 2 Pro's three electrochromic dimming states (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nSwitching between just slightly dim glasses while watching YouTube and working out, so you can see your treadmill, then taking a break and quickly switching to maximum opaque, so you can block out everything else in front of you and just focus on your content, is priceless.This is indeed the kind of \\\"gimmick\\\" that I'm all for \\u2013 a very convenient feature all \\\"wearable display\\\" glasses should have.As for volume controls, or any other controls you may be asking for \\u2013 we don't get any, so you'll have to adjust your volume from your phone, or Steam Deck, or whichever other device you decide to use with these glasses.Image quality: watching movies, gaming on the Steam Deck, working on an iPad, MacBook\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nXreal Air 2 Pro connected to a Steam Deck (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nThe Xreal Air 2 Pro give you a 1080p (Full HD) virtual display that feels about 130 inches big, with a field-of-view (FOV) of 46 degrees. Those specs are exactly the same as on the base Xreal Air 2, so nothing spectacular here \\u2013 no 4K.We get the same 500 nits of brightness and up to 120Hz refresh rate also, although those specs are perfectly adequate.I've used the Xreal Air 2 Pro mostly for watching YouTube and Netflix on my phone, and gaming on my Steam Deck, and I'm very happy with the screen quality. You get a big, bright virtual screen with great colors and sharpness, and basically no latency, which is crucial for gaming.\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nUsing the Xreal Air 2 Pro as a secondary screen for my iPad has been excellent (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSame with using the Xreal Air 2 Pro with my Steam Deck (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nNow, depending on which device you connect the glasses to, you can expect them to either mirror its screen (Steam Deck, iPhone / Android phones), or serve as a secondary display by default (iPad, MacBook).Using these glasses for work is an actual, realistic scenario; they've been an excellent secondary screen for my iPad. Even small text is legible, thanks to the virtual screen's fantastic clarity and sharpness.But these glasses shine extra when they're used for watching movies or YouTube videos, as it really feels like a private cinema experience you just pulled out of your pocket. If you tint them to their darkest mode, so that the outside world gets blocked and you only see the bright, big screen, all you really need beyond that is some popcorn. Great stuff!The virtual screen is absolutely fixed to your head, so you can turn around or lie comfortably on your back for a binge watch of your favorite show, and you'll always have a centered view of it.Another thing worth noting is that because the Xreal Air 2 Pro have a sensor for wearing detection, they automatically turn on when you wear them, and switch off when you take them off. In addition, your content will usually pause when you take them off; which I've noticed at least with some iPhone and Android apps.ConnectivityThere's no setup involved; as soon as you connect these glasses to your phone, laptop or Steam Deck, they'll immediately be recognized and utilized.The way you connect the Xreal Air 2 Pro to such devices is via an included USB-C cable. However, it's very important that your devices have a USB-C port with DisplayPort output, in order for this to work.Most flagship phones (but not all), most modern iPads, MacBooks, and laptops all have\\u00a0DisplayPort over USB-C support; however it's still best to do some research on your phone or device, and make sure that it does, before buying glasses like these.Notably, the Nintendo Switch doesn't have DisplayPort support from its USB-C port, so for it, you'll want to get the Xreal Beam, which allows for using HDMI connections instead. Speaking of the Xreal Beam\\u2026Xreal Beam, companion app\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nThe Xreal Beam is optional, and sold separately (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nThose two are optional. The Xreal Beam is a sold-separately device that you can connect to your Xreal Air 2 Pro, in order to get some smart functionality and extra features out of them, such as the ability to resize or reposition your virtual screen. Check out our Xreal Beam review to learn more on that device.Personally, I really wish these glasses already came with such features included \\u2013 a built-in option to resize and reposition the virtual screen would've really made them top tier, but alas.As mentioned earlier, the Xreal Beam also allows for HDMI connectivity, besides just USB-C, which is necessary if you wish to use a Nintendo Switch with your glasses. The Beam additionally gives the glasses some smart functionality, such as running apps like Netflix without needing your phone.The Beam even has a bit of built-in storage, so you can theoretically download videos on it, and watch them on the go, without ever having to use your phone. It does need charging, though, and its battery life is about 3 hours.Another optional (and this time free) thing you may want to play around with is the Xreal companion app \\u2013 Nebula. Unfortunately it's only available on certain Android phones; no iPhone support.Besides being useful for updating your glasses, the Nebula app gives them actual AR functionality, utilizing their limited head tracking capabilities. The app features an AR launcher, a video player, web browsing with some limited multitasking capabilities, and some AR apps built specifically for the Xreal Air series.Speakers\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nXreal Air 2 Pro speaker (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nThe Xreal Air 2 Pro feature stereo speakers, one on the bottom of each frame, facing towards your ears. The sound you get is clean and spatial, and can get very loud.While it's pretty weak on the low-end side of the audio spectrum, as can be expected, it's rich on mids and highs, and with generous stereo separation.So the speaker quality is pretty fantastic for watching movies, adding extra immersion to the whole \\\"private cinema\\\" selling point of these glasses.As for whether you'll disturb others around you \\u2013 when I used the Xreal Air 2 Pro in quiet environments people could hear faint high-frequency sounds coming off of them even at fairly low volumes.So depending on where you plan on using these glasses, you may want to pair some earbuds or headphones instead of using the built-in speakers, if you want perfect privacy, and to avoid disturbing others.Verdict\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nXreal Air 2 Pro with included case and Light Shield accessory (Image credit - PhoneArena)\\n\\nThe Xreal Air 2 Pro are now my favorite \\\"wearable display\\\" glasses we've reviewed so far. The fantastic, bright and crisp virtual screen they provide, paired with a clear, wide soundstage, as well as the new electrochromic glass dimming feature, make for a truly well-rounded private cinema experience.If you're in the market for a big screen that fits in your pocket, whether you're a traveler who watches a lot of movies, a gamer on the go, or you simply wish to experiment with your productivity set up, the Xreal Air 2 Pro might just be perfect for you.However, if you're not sold on the electrochromic glass dimming feature, you can comfortably go with the more affordable Xreal Air 2, and barely consider it a compromise, if at all. Alternatively, if you actually want more features, it might be best to wait for the Xreal Air 2 Ultra.\\n\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\n Bright and sharp virtual screen\\n Super convenient electrochromic glass dimming feature\\n Loud, clear and spacious sound\\n Adjustable frame angles\\n Quality carrying case included\\n\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\n Still 1080p\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoneArena Rating:\\n\\n\\n8.9\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow do we rate?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWas this article helpful?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSend\\n\\n\\n\\nWe may wish to follow up.

But when was the last time you tried something so thrilling, multisensorial, and enlivening that it had you talking about it to anyone who would listen for months afterwards?\\nThe rising demand for experiences that engage the senses all at once has seen virtual reality (VR) come into its own, taking entertainment to heights that have never been reached before \\u2013 and as a result, we\\u2019re seeing more businesses and organisations putting this innovative technology to good use, with ideas that go beyond gaming and film-watching.\\nFrom fighting off zombies and exploring the extraterrestrial to playing sports against a backdrop of live audiences, unearthing the mysteries of the Vatican, and engaging in all manner of mind-bending activities that transcend the realms of escape rooms and interactive theatres, the entertainment on offer in today\\u2019s modern world knows no bounds. If you can dream it up, then you can probably do it, and almost nothing is off limits.\\n\\u00a0Here, we take a look at some of the most mind-blowing options of the moment.\\nThe immersive gaming landscape in the UK has come on in leaps and bounds this year, and there are now a plethora of thrilling options to choose from that are guaranteed to wow. Image credit: Zyabich/Bigstock.com\\nImmersive gaming\\n\\nThe immersive gaming landscape in the UK has come on in leaps and bounds this year, and there are now a plethora of thrilling options to choose from that are guaranteed to wow. Imagine stepping into a vast, interactive environment where all your senses are engaged, your heart races, and you experience the excitement alongside teammates, family, and friends, and you\\u2019ll be on the right track, with this dynamic way of gaming surpassing the limitations of playing from home in every imaginable way.\\nThe best part? People of all ages enjoy these activities, from anywhere, at any time. VR gaming is not confined to any specific age group and offers a diverse range of activities tailored to a wide array of different preferences.\\nThe UK\\u2019s entertainment sector has witnessed substantial growth in VR gaming, providing a growing number of consumers with fully immersive experiences that are so mind blowing that can\\u2019t help but keep coming back for more. VR experiences in Birmingham, in particular, are quite simply next level, and has become a hub for VR enthusiasts of all kinds, attracting groups of friends, corporate team-building events, and family outings.\\nFrom feeling the adrenaline surge in a first-person shooter game, getting lost in spine-tingling escape rooms and battling in futuristic arenas, to fending off zombies in a post-apocalyptic world, solving mysteries in ancient pyramids or embarking on countless other adventures, there are so many options now available to choose from that you\\u2019ll be spoilt for choice.\\nNext-level storytelling and films\\n\\nAre you craving a truly mind-bending cinematic experience? If you\\u2019re bored of all the usual repetitive films then VR movies are on hand to change things up with immersive storytelling that makes you a part of it. Instead of passively watching, VR makes it possible for viewers to engage actively in the narrative, offering a director\\u2019s perspective where you control the scenes, explore the environments, and make decisions that shape the story. While traditional cinema films are limited to the confines of the screen itself, VR versions offer a 360-degree view so that the audience can participate fully in the plot using a variety of different senses, giving them the power to decide the characters\\u2019 paths and outcomes, and eliminating the frustration of wondering what would have happened had they done something different.\\nIt\\u2019s an innovative approach to film that is revolutionising the way in which we experience narratives in the modern world, and London and various other cities across the UK are welcoming an increasing number of entertainment venues offering this type of experiences, with them eventually expected to become the norm. Already, you can spend a few hours watching quality movies that outstrip those IMAX masterpieces. StoryFutures, the country\\u2019s National Centre for Immersive Storytelling, has been one of the first to dip its toe into the waters of immersive cinemas and arts, so make this your first port of call if you\\u2019re seeking your first taste.\\nIf you\\u2019re bored of all the usual repetitive films then VR movies are on hand to change things up with immersive storytelling that makes you a part of it\\nVR hospitality business experiences\\n\\nGone are the days of having to make your way to a physical restaurant to test it out and see whether you like the vibe, and as more and more individuals express interest in taking virtual tours in restaurants, food courts, wineries, bars and other hospitality venues, it\\u2019s another area in which we can eventually expect to see VR playing a starring role.\\nA 2021 study from ePOS Hybrid found that four in ten consumers in the UK would like the option to experience a virtual tour of a location before making the journey there to ensure that it\\u2019s the kind of place they are looking for. We\\u2019ve already seen KFC dabbling with the technology, and it likely won\\u2019t be long before fine dining eateries and Michelin-starred restaurants catch on \\u2013 although they\\u2019re likely to want to maintain a certain level of mystery, as it\\u2019s all part of their exclusive allure.\\nWe\\u2019re still some way off from VR hospitality tours becoming the norm, and some work will need to be done on the digital infrastructures currently available in order to facilitate them with ease. But as VR headsets and other related tools become more commonplace and more people have them at home as standard, the era of VR-powered hospitality venues is only getting closer.\\nImmersive entertainment\\n\\nLive events such as theatre performances, sports competitions, concerts, and operas have long relied on human presence to convey messages and evoke emotions, from the joy of seeing your favourite team win a game to the magic and awe of musical performances. VR now allows fans to experience these events from premium seats in physical venues, offering 360-degree views in soundproof chambers that engage all senses, elevating the experience to incredible new heights that once couldn\\u2019t even have been imagined.\\nAs VR technology continues to advance, the line between live and virtual events is set to become increasingly blurred, and the constraints of money, travel and time will all but be eliminated \\u2013 with the removal of these barriers will make this new generation of entertainment\\u00a0 accessible for enthusiasts everywhere.\\n\\n\\n\\nTags: entertainment Gaming technology virtual reality VR \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\tYou Might Also Like\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n            Royal Ascot 2024: Why this year\\u2019s event was the most show-stopping edition yet        \\n\\n\\n\\n        By LLM Reporters \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n            The way Artificial Intelligence is reshaping the digital industry        \\n\\n\\n\\n        By LLM Reporters \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n            The evolution of casino gaming: From ancient beginnings to the online revolution        \\n\\n\\n\\n        By LLM Reporters \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n            7 reasons to attend the Henley Festival this year        \\n\\n\\n\\n        By Caroline Cooper \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n            The best of summer sport in the UK for 2024        \\n\\n\\n\\n        By LLM Reporters \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n            How high-end gamers are reaching the next level in 2024 \\u2013 no expense spared        \\n\\n\\n\\n        By LLM Reporters \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n            The top luxury digital entertainment and gaming trends of 2024 so far        \\n\\n\\n\\n        By LLM Reporters \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n            Why Asia is the ultimate destination for high rollers in 2024        \\n\\n\\n\\n        By LLM Reporters \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n            Launching an app for your luxury business: The key steps to success        \\n\\n\\n\\n        By LLM Reporters \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n            Luxury meets the latest in modern innovation with Pernod Ricard\\u2019s Avi\\u00f3n: How the global brand is redefining prestige tequila with its debut NFT release        \\n\\n\\n\\n        By LLM Reporters \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nLatest on LLM\\n\\n\\n\\n Tailored Travel: Discover local luxury car hire at Valencia Airport \\n\\n\\n\\n 4 ways VR is changing the UK\\u2019s entertainment industry \\u2013 and why you should try a thrilling new VR experience this summer \\n\\n\\n\\n The best luxury accommodations for your holidays on Elba Island \\n\\n\\n\\n GetJet Airlines: How this key player is redefining luxury and efficiency in the aviation Industry \\n\\n\\n\\n Royal Ascot 2024: Why this year\\u2019s event was the most show-stopping edition yet \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBooking.com\\n\\n \\nWIN\\n\\n\\n\\n Win an overnight stay with dinner at Soar Mill Cove plus a Salcombe Brewery tour and beer bundle \\n\\n\\n\\n Win an overnight stay with dinner for 2 at Hart Shoreditch in London \\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nThe LLM - Luxury Lifestyle Magazine Newsletter\\n\\nSign up for one of our free newsletters to receive the latest on travel, high-end fashion and ultimate luxury straight from LLM - Luxury Lifestyle Magazine.\\n                LLM - Luxury Lifestyle Magazine is operated and run by Luxury Lifestyle Media Group Limited.\\n            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                Will be used in accordance with our Privacy Policy\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout us\\nContact us\\nAdvertise\\nWork for us\\nPrivacy Policy\\nCookies\\nTerms & Conditions\\nAdvertising Terms & Conditions\\nWork with us: Luxury SEO Content\\nPartners\\n \\n\\n                Copyright \\u00a9 Luxury Lifestyle Media Group Limited 2024.

And the best news is, you don\\u2019t have to spend $3,500 to get your hands on a good machine. Some of the best VR headsets include the Meta Quest 3 \\u2014 it\\u2019s available for a much more reasonable $500, which is a tad more digestible by our standards. Whether you want a more expansive virtual workspace or you want to give the undead a run for their money, there are some great VR headsets out there that will be useful in a variety of situations.\\nHow we test VR headsets\\nI tend to judge VR headsets on a few basic criteria: Ergonomics, immersion and controls. It\\u2019s not that hard to shove a mobile display into a plastic headset and strap some cheap elastic headbands onto it. But it takes skill to craft something that\\u2019s well balanced and doesn\\u2019t feel uncomfortable after 30 minutes.\\nMy test for ergonomics is fairly simple: How long can I wear a headset until I start to feel discomfort? For the most ergonomic devices, like the Quest 3, that could easily be an hour or two. But heavier PC hardware often feels cumbersome after just 15 minutes \\u2014 you won\\u2019t find headsets guilty of that in this guide.\\nImmersion, meanwhile, comes from having high resolution screens with fast refresh rates, so everything looks sharp and smooth. Field of view is also a major element, as it describes how well VR screens can cover what you see. Having a narrow field of view makes it feel like you\\u2019re looking through a pair of binoculars, and limits your sense of \\u201cpresence,\\u201d or the idea that you\\u2019re actually transported to a virtual world.\\nA wide field of view, on the other hand, can make it seem like you\\u2019re actually flying over the globe in Google Earth. We look at a few popular games, like Superhot, Beat Saber and Pistol Whip, on every headset to judge how immersed we feel.\\nThe best controllers fit naturally in your hands and offer accurate tracking. The industry has basically adopted the design of Meta\\u2019s excellent touch controllers, but we\\u2019re also seeing intriguing leaps forward like Valve\\u2019s finger tracking gamepads. We judge controllers based on how easy they are to hold, how they hold up to sweaty gameplay sessions and how easily headsets can track their position in space.\\nBest VR headsets for 2024\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar / Engadget\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead our full Meta Quest 3 VR headset review\\nStorage capacity: 128GB | Battery life: 2.2 hours | Field of view: 110 degrees (horizontal), 96 degrees (vertical) | Max refresh rate: 120Hz\\nThe long-awaited follow-up to the Quest 2 is an upgrade in every respect: It\\u2019s more comfortable to wear, it has higher quality screens and it has full-color mixed reality cameras, allowing you to see the real world alongside virtual elements. While it\\u2019s more expensive at $500, it\\u2019s also a far more capable headset than the Quest 2, with hardware and optics that will keep you happily immersed in VR for years.\\nThe Quest 3 is powered by Qualcomm\\u2019s Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip, which Meta says has double the graphics power of the Quest 2. That additional power is noticeable in games like Red Matter 2, which feature updated textures that deliver an experience closer to PC VR. The Quest 3\\u2019s new displays run at 2,064 by 2,208 pixels per eye, offering an even better experience than the PlayStation VR2. Its mixed reality cameras also let you easily see the real world, in case you need to quickly answer a text or Slack message. And they enable games that can be built around your room.\\nWhat makes the Quest 3 interesting is that it offers more than just solid VR: It also gives you a glimpse at what a mixed reality future could be. While it\\u2019s not as sharp or capable as Apple\\u2019s Vision Pro, that\\u2019s understandable. And just like previous Quest headsets, you can also plug it into a gaming PC for higher quality VR experiences.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\nSharp new screens and lenses\\nMore compact than Quest 2\\nFaster performance\\nMixed reality cameras make it easier to see the real world\\nAdjustable for glasses\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\nMore expensive than before\\nOnly 128GB of storage to start\\nNo battery life improvements\\n\\n\\n\\n$429 at Walmart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar / Engadget\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead our full Apple Vision Pro review\\nStorage capacity: 256GB, 512GB, 1TB | Battery life: 2 hours | Field of view: 100 degrees | Max refresh rate: 100Hz\\nWith the Vision Pro, Apple is attempting to do for VR what the iPod did for media players, and what the iPhone did for smartphones. It\\u2019s a bold, $3,500 gamble to reshape the world of VR around Apple\\u2019s idea of \\u201cspatial computing.\\u201d It\\u2019s incredibly expensive, somewhat uncomfortable and surprisingly buggy, but the Vision Pro is the biggest leap forward we\\u2019ve seen in the stagnating VR industry in years. Most people shouldn\\u2019t buy it, but if you\\u2019re a developer or someone with money to burn and want the best immersive headset today, it\\u2019s truly in a league of its own.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\nIncredible Micro-OLED screens\\nIntuitive gesture controls\\nConvincing Spatial Audio\\nImmersive Video is astoundingly realistic\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\nIncredibly expensive\\nvisionOS is very buggy\\nHeavy compared to other headsets\\nExternal battery is annoying and doesn\\u2019t last long\\nNot many native visionOS apps\\n\\n\\n\\n$3,500 at Apple\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMeta Quest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead our full Meta Quest 2 VR headset review\\nStorage capacity: 128GB, 256GB | Battery life: 2-3 hours | Field of view: 104 degrees | Max refresh rate: 90Hz\\nOver years since its release, the Meta Quest 2 remains the best budget VR option for the vast majority of consumers. It\\u2019s a completely standalone headset, and it\\u2019s comfortable to wear for long sessions. And now that it\\u2019s down to a new standard price of $250, it remains the best way to jump into VR without spending a ton of money.\\nHere\\u2019s what\\u2019s still good, though: there\\u2019s a huge library of titles that you can experience anywhere, and it\\u2019s bundled with Meta\\u2019s great motion controllers. You can also connect the Quest 2 to a gaming PC to stream more complex VR experiences.\\nThe Quest 2 features fast-switching LCDs with a resolution of 1832\\u00d71920 per eye. It also has a smooth 90Hz refresh rate, which is impressive for something running entirely on mobile hardware. The Quest 2\\u2019s field of view isn\\u2019t the best \\u2014 it\\u2019s been measured at just around 90 degrees \\u2014 but it\\u2019s still enough to enjoy most VR experiences. You can also use different face pads to increase its field of view a bit. And if you want an even more comfortable fit, you can snag the Elite headstrap for $49 (or $129 with a built-in battery and case).\\nThe Quest 2 may not offer the best VR experience, but it\\u2019s certainly the most accessible headset on the market.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\nHigher resolution screens\\nMore powerful hardware\\nExcellent standalone VR\\nWorks well as a desktop VR headset\\nPrice is a steal\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\nStandalone games still limited by mobile hardware\\n90Hz isn\\u2019t available at launch\\nFit adjustment is a bit wonky\\n\\n\\n\\n$250 at Verizon\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto By Devindra Hardawar / Engadget\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead our full PlayStation VR2 headset review\\nStorage capacity: 128GB, 256GB | Battery life: 3 hours | Field of view: 110 degrees | Max refresh rate: 120Hz\\nThe PS VR2 is one of the best headset we\\u2019ve tested. It offers dual 2K OLED HDR screens, effectively giving you 4K quality. It\\u2019s one of the most comfortable headsets around. And it has some genuinely refreshing new features, like eye tracking and headset haptics. (Yes, it can literally rock your noggin.) Best of all, the PS VR2 delivers high-quality virtual reality without the need for a $1,000+ gaming PC \\u2013 all you need is a PlayStation 5.\\nNow, our recommendation comes with a few caveats. At $550, the PS VR2 is more expensive than the PS5 itself. And it\\u2019s unclear how quickly its game library will fill up. The initial run has only a few exclusives, like Horizon VR and Gran Turismo 7, and we haven\\u2019t seen many new titles since then. But it\\u2019s still the easiest way to experience high-end VR, and it\\u2019s a major upgrade over the original PS VR.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\nExcellent OLED displays\\nComfortable fit\\nHeadset haptics feel immersive\\nSense controllers are solid\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\nIncredibly high launch price\\nLimited new titles\\nLong term development is suspect\\n\\n\\n\\n$550 at Sony\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar / Engadget\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead our full Valve Index VR kit review\\nStorage capacity: N/A | Battery life: 7 hours | Field of view: 108 degrees | Max refresh rate: 120Hz\\nValve\\u2019s Index kit remains one of the best high-end solutions on the market that provides a truly immersive VR experience. For $999 you get the Index headset, Valve\\u2019s finger tracking controllers and two SteamVR base stations. While we\\u2019ve seen higher-resolution headsets arrive in the last two years, it\\u2019s still a very solid option, with a 1,440 by 1,600 pixel resolution, an eye-watering 144Hz refresh rate and a massive 130-degree field of view. I\\u2019d gladly lose a few pixels for the Index\\u2019s smoother and more expansive screen, which are still far beyond most other consumer headsets.\\nAs a SteamVR product, the Index requires installing two sensors at opposite corners of your room. And of course, it\\u2019s wired to your PC. But that clunkiness is worth it for the higher refresh rate and more accurate tracking. Sure, it\\u2019s not as easy to use as the Quest 2, but at this price range, we assume you\\u2019ll suffer a bit of inconvenience to get a truly high-quality VR experience.\\nValve\\u2019s finger tracking controllers are fantastic as well, with a convenient strap that locks them onto your hands. They make playing Half-Life: Alyx feel like a dream. It\\u2019s unfortunate that other VR games haven\\u2019t fully taken advantage of the finger tracking though.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\n144Hz refresh rate with a 130-degree field of view\\nExcellent finger-tracking controllers\\nStellar performance\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\nRequires installing sensors in your room\\nWired design\\n\\n\\n\\n$999 at Steam\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhoto by Devindra Hardawar / Engadget\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRead our full Bigscreen Beyond VR headset review\\nStorage capacity: N/A | Battery life: 2 hours | Field of view: 102 degrees | Max refresh rate: 90Hz\\nEssentially an upgrade for the Index, the Beyond is a unique spin on a VR headset from Bigscreen, the developer of a popular app for watching video in VR. It looks more like an oversized pair of goggles than a massive VR headset. The $999 Beyond is the lightest VR option we\\u2019ve ever seen (it weighs a tad more than a deck of playing cards), and its Micro-OLED screens are sharp and offer near-perfect contrast. Unlike LCD screens, black can look genuinely black with the Beyond.\\nThe downside, though, is that the Bigscreen Beyond is expensive. It\\u2019s $999 on its own if you\\u2019re just upgrading a Valve Index setup. If you\\u2019re starting from scratch, though, you\\u2019ll also need to buy two Steam VR base stations and a pair of Index controllers. That adds up to a whopping $1,578.\\nThe Bigscreen Beyond also requires a custom face cushion, which is built from a 3D facescan when you place your order. Unfortunately, that makes it harder to share than other headsets. There\\u2019s also no room for glasses, since it\\u2019s so slim. You can buy prescription lens inserts from Bigscreen for an additional fee. And of course, you\\u2019ll have to live with a cable tethered to your PC, there\\u2019s none of the freedom of the cordless Meta Quest headsets.\\nFor all of its complexity, though, the Bigscreen Beyond delivers the most immersive PC VR experience I\\u2019ve ever seen. Since it\\u2019s so light, you can easily wear it for hours. Together with its glorious screens, it\\u2019s the best option for VR enthusiasts who don\\u2019t mind dealing with cost and complexity for true immersion.\\n\\n\\nPros\\n\\nIncredibly light and comfortable\\nSharp and bright Micro-OLED screens\\nWorks alongside existing Valve Index accessories\\n\\n\\nCons\\n\\nExpensive\\nNo built-in audio\\nStill exhibits artifacting like other VR headsets\\n\\n\\n\\n$999 at Bigscreen\\n\\nOther VR headsets we\\u2019ve tested\\nMeta Quest Pro\\nAs great as the Meta Quest 3 is, the Quest 2 is still a very good entry-level VR headset, and it\\u2019s worth considering if it\\u2019s on sale below its current $250 list price. The Meta Quest Pro, on the the hand, is an expensive boondoggle best ignored.\\nHTC Vive Pro 2\\nOutside of Meta\\u2019s hardware, the HTC Vive Pro 2 remains a fantastic PC headset, but it\\u2019s far more expensive than the Valve Index, which is more comfortable and offers better audio.\\nVR headset FAQs\\nHow do VR headsets work?\\nAt the most basic level, a VR headset is simply a high quality screen that you\\u2019re holding up to your face. For a wired headset, the actual work of rendering a game is done on either a PC or game console. For completely wireless devices, like the Meta Quest 3, that work is handled right on the headset. They rely on either external sensors, or sensors built into the headsets, to map your physical space. While you can use a traditional gamepad or keyboard and mouse in VR, they typically use motion tracking controllers to immerse you in their 3D environments.\\nWhat VR headset is best for full body tracking?\\nWhile we\\u2019re still waiting for a truly great haptic VR bodysuit to arrive, you can still achieve accurate body tracking with most Steam VR-compatible PC headsets. The Valve Index and HTC Vive Pro 2 both rely on room-tracking sensors that can map your body more effectively than the built-in sensors on competitors. You can also add HTC Vive Trackers to wrist and leg straps, as well as belts, for even better coverage. The Meta Quest 3 doesn\\u2019t have any easy body tracking solutions, but you can add Vive trackers when it\\u2019s plugged into your PC to mimic a Steam VR headset.\\nOnly a few experiences, like VRChat, take advantage of full body tracking at the moment. Currently there aren\\u2019t any body tracking solutions for the PlayStation VR and VR2, but we\\u2019re intrigued by the company\\u2019s Mocopi body trackers, which were really announced in Japan.\\nWhat VR headsets are better than Oculus?\\nOculus is the previous name for Meta\\u2019s VR hardware.

This therapist-assisted treatment leverages human-computer interaction through a head-mounted display with video screens, headphones, and a head-tracking device. This combination allows patients to actively engage in a three-dimensional computer environment.\\nHow VRET Works\\nThe hardware and software components of VRET work together to create a virtual environment where patients can see and interact with objects and scenarios relevant to their specific therapy needs. This immersive setting allows them to confront their fears in a safe and controlled way. For example, a patient with a fear of heights could be virtually exposed to progressively higher situations, such as climbing a ladder or standing on a balcony.\\nMarket Growth Drivers\\nThe VRET market is expected to experience significant growth driven by several key factors:\\n\\nRising Prevalence of Anxiety Disorders: The increasing rates of heart surgery, stroke, and mental health issues, such as anxiety disorders, are creating a greater demand for effective treatment solutions. VRET offers a promising approach for managing these conditions.\\nGovernment Support for Digital Healthcare: Government initiatives promoting the use of internet-of-things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare applications are creating a favorable environment for the adoption of VRET.\\nPopularity of AR/VR Technology: The growing popularity of augmented reality (AR) and VR products, particularly in developed nations, is driving interest in VRET as a therapeutic tool.\\n\\nAdvantages Over Traditional Therapy\\nVRET offers several advantages over traditional therapy approaches:\\n\\nCost-Effectiveness: VRET can be more cost-effective than traditional methods, as it eliminates the need for exposure to real-world situations that may be expensive or impractical.\\nImproved Data Collection: VRET allows for the collection of more accurate and valuable data on patient responses compared to traditional methods. This data can then be used to refine treatment approaches and potentially guide the development of medication-based therapies.\\n\\nMarket Challenges\\nDespite its potential, the VRET market also faces some challenges:\\n\\nLimited Accessibility: The high costs associated with VRET technology can limit accessibility, particularly in developing countries.\\nLack of Awareness: A lack of awareness about VRET as a treatment option, especially in developing regions, can hinder market growth.\\nCompetition: The increasing competition among major players in the VRET market can put pressure on pricing and innovation.\\n\\nLooking Ahead\\nBy addressing these challenges and leveraging its unique advantages, VRET has the potential to become a mainstream therapeutic tool, offering a more immersive and effective approach to treating anxiety disorders and phobias.\\nNorth America is anticipated to be the major contributor to the Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy market over the forecast years, with most of its revenue coming from Canada and the US. Patient and medical staff awareness of virtual reality exposure therapy's benefits for treating mental illness and other diseases is the critical element fueling this market's dominance. One of the main factors fueling market expansion in this sector is the increasing government expenditure on healthcare infrastructure. Much money is being spent in the region to combine cutting-edge medical procedures with immersive technology, likely to hasten market expansion there. Similar to this, expanding regional markets would be encouraged by increased healthcare R&D.\\nIn addition, the Asia Pacific Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy market is expected to grow significantly during the forecast period. Growth in virtual reality exposure therapy use in this market is expected due to increased stroke cases in nations like Japan, Taiwan, China, and India. Additionally, the fact that most workstation and electronic parts suppliers have their headquarters in Asia-Pacific would promote the adoption and understanding of such treatment.\\nMajor market players operating in the Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy market include\\nFirsthand Technology, Atheer, Medical Realities, Oculus VR, Echopixel, Osso VR, Surgical Theatre, Augmedic, and Truevision, among others.

With a near-eye device, virtual information can be projected onto real-world objects, creating an interactive experience. This technology can be used for entertainment, but it can also enhance learning and manufacturing processes.Although the AR field has gained immense traction, mass production of AR waveguides \\u2014 the core light-transmitting components in AR devices \\u2014 has been difficult. To overcome high costs and fabrication challenges, Sun et al. designed a novel approach for manufacturing optical waveguides.Using a cost-effective LCD 3D printer, the team fabricated components of a geometric AR waveguide, bonding 3 dielectric reflectors and other printed components with UV resin. Their modifications to the printing process significantly improved surface roughness without the need for molding, dicing, and post-polishing, thereby reducing labor costs while maintaining image quality.\\u201cThe intricate nature of traditional AR fabrication techniques and their high precision requirements for optical characteristics have become significant barriers to overcoming the cost of mass production,\\u201d said author Ranjith Unnithan. \\u201cThe success of our prototype suggests potential for widespread application and commercialization.\\u201dThe authors plan to continue improving AR device functionality by exploring advanced materials and printing techniques. They also look forward to seeing a wider application of 3D-printed optics.\\u201cOur future projects involve refining the 3D printing process to enhance waveguide performance and durability,\\u201d said author Dechuan Sun.\\u201cFor others in the field, investigating new applications of 3D-printed optics in various technological domains could be a promising avenue,\\u201d said author Younger Liang.Source: \\u201cAdditive 3D printed optical waveguide for augmented reality,\\u201d by Dechuan Sun, Gregory Tanyi, Alan Lee, Chris French, Younger Liang, Christina Lim, and Ranjith R Unnithan, APL Photonics (2024).

Artwork lines the walls of the lobby while themed suites captivate guests.\\n\\n\\nEach year, the hotel hosts an artist in residence, showcasing works from local artists. Leah Smithson, an L.A.-based multidisciplinary artist, is 2024\\u2019s featured creative. Her work has been displayed globally and she is part of of NEW INC, NEW MUSEUM\\u2019s incubator for art, design, and technology.\\n\\nSmithson\\u2019s exhibit at Hotel Figueroa is titled Limitless and celebrates the \\u201calchemy of invention.\\u201d A fully interactive experience, exhibit includes traditional paintings and an exclusive Augmented Reality sculpture \\u2014 a first for the hotel. Visitors and guests can interact with the immersive one-of-a-kind AR sculpture through their smartphones, tablets, and the new Apple Vision Pro, to launch a visual ASMR effect that tells the story of Smithson\\u2019s work.\\n\\n\\n\\u201cI explore the human condition using portraits that mirror an emotional state or frame of mind, rather than the likeness of a person. This work examines complex and emotional subjects objectively, leveraging both traditional\\u2014painting, ceramic sculpture\\u2014and new media\\u20143D animation, XR, architectural projection installation,\\u201d explained Smithson in a press release. \\u201cMy recent works incorporate images of avatars. Avatars, often generic in nature, transcend individual differences, so my recent works employ avatars as a tool to offer a glimpse into the collective human experience of love and loss. They remind us that even in the vastness of the world we live in, we are not alone.\\u201d\\n\\nTaking inspiration from the hotel\\u2019s rich history and honoring female innovators, Smithson worked with various materials to ensure an impactful exhibit. Foe example, for some of her paintings, she looked at the historical link between textiles and innovation and utilized canvas crafted from biodynamic cotton. This method reflected cotton breeder Sally Fox\\u2019s cultivation of naturally colored, organically grown cotton plants.\\nMORE FOR YOUExactly When Apple Will Launch iPhone 16 And iPhone 16 ProApple Warns Millions Of iPhone Users\\u2014Stop Using Google ChromeJD Vance Highlights \\u2018Hillbilly Elegy\\u2019 Roots\\u2014And Praises Trump\\u2014In Debut RNC SpeechChimera by Leah Smithson.Leah Smithson\\n\\nRanging in size and shape from 22\\u201d x 25\\u201d to 52\\u201d x 64\\u201d, select pieces of Smithson\\u2019s works are available to the public for purchase.

In spring 2024, Hotel Figueroa hosted a series of exclusive ceramic classes in collaboration with L.A. design studio Two Faced Ceramics. Hosted by founder and ceramist Eve Palguta, the 16-person classes were an intimate, hands-on look into the world of ceramic homeware. Each class had a dedicated theme inspired by notable dates such as Women\\u2019s History Month and the Total Solar Eclipse, and guests were taught how to make jewelry dishes, mugs, and succulent holders.The lobby.

From my view, I'm staring at a 120-inch display projected two feet in front of me thanks to a meticulous arrangement of light and mirrors within the Viture One's XR Glasses.View at AmazonInstead of transmitting you into a virtual or augmented reality like Apple's Vision Pro, the Viture glasses simply extend from -- and are powered by -- the source they're connected to, serving as an ultraportable, on-your-face monitor. To be clear, comparing the XR Glasses to a $3,500 productivity wearable is an apples-to-oranges affair. Unless you consider yourself an early adopter, the target customers of the two gadgets are notably different.Viture is pitching its glasses to people who want to game, watch movies, or surf the web without needing to be physically in front of a TV or office desk. The glasses' 120-inch projection is more suited for folks who would rather binge-watch shows while lying in bed or are on a flight and seek privacy when using a phone, tablet, or laptop. But the overlap in use cases is uncanny and not unintentional.Also: I've tried Vision Pro and other top XR headsets and here's the one most people should buyMy use case slots right in between: I want a larger platform to draft news and reviews and answer secretive emails as I sit in the make-believe comfort of public transit. The glasses are also practical for when your partner wants to watch The Bachelor on the living room TV, but you're more interested in the marriage of basketball and the spirit of competition.    A mock-up of what it looks like to wear the Viture glasses. Kerry Wan/ZDNETThanks to the single USB-C cable needed to power the device, I can easily pair the Viture glasses to my MacBook or Android phone. Bonus points if the latter is a Samsung Galaxy that supports DeX mode or a Motorola handset that supports Ready For; in those two platforms, you'll be greeted with a desktop interface of your usual mobile apps and services.Also: I demoed Xreal's AR glasses for spatial computing and they're better than I expectedHere's the killer feature of the Viture glasses: Spatial video support, the same 3D playback capability as found on the Vision Pro. While an adapter is necessary for the glasses to pair with an iPhone, the company has developed a new SpaceWalker app on iOS that lets users watch spatial videos recorded by an iPhone 15 Pro or Vision Pro. I played a couple of clips that I had previously reserved for the Apple headset, and reliving those moments with such depth and realism was quite eye-opening.Of course, there's no standard of spatial video playback quality for me to compare with, but based on what I saw, the essence of the format was there. I could see the separation between the subjects in the videos, and that remained consistent so long as my camera was well-distanced and in focus.    You can also watch 3D videos and movies on the Viture One XR Glasses. Kerry Wan/ZDNETAs far as the visual experience of the glasses goes, it's adequate, but nothing groundbreaking. For prescription wearers like myself, there are two Myopia rotary knobs (think focus dials) on the top of the Viture One that can be adjusted to your vision. That means you don't have to, and shouldn't, wear the XR glasses over your existing pair. You also don't need to fork up $150 for tailor-made prescription lenses like you would with the Vision Pro.Also: The best VR headsets right now (and how Apple Vision Pro stacks up)I found the best way to calibrate this was to keep the opposite eye closed as I was tuning each side. However, finding the perfect focus will take some trial and error, and even when you think you've struck the right distance, the corners and edges of the 120-inch projection will remain blurry.\\u00a0That seems to be unavoidable due to how large but close the projections are to your eyes. For example, if you hold an object an inch from your eyes, you'll notice how difficult it is to focus on it.Still, Viture has integrated some clever mechanisms with the lenses, like a self-dimming electrochromic film that you can toggle on or off depending on how bright your environment is. It's basically a built-in projector shade and helps the most when you're using the glasses outdoors.    My best attempt at capturing what's shown when the glasses are worn. Kerry Wan/ZDNETViture partnered with Harman to develop and tune the side-firing speakers of the wearable, and I'm impressed. They remind me a lot of bone-conduction headphones where audio beams against the side of your head and into your ears. Since the speakers are lying against you, no one but you can hear the audio output, which adds to the privacy focus that the company is going for.\\u00a0Perhaps the biggest question with such wearables is whether or not they cause symptoms of dizziness and motion sickness. From my experience, which includes one- to two-hour stints, I never felt discomfort when using the glasses.\\u00a0Also: Apple Vision Pro review: Fascinating, flawed, and needs to fix 5 thingsI credit that to two factors: the lightness of the wearable compared to traditional headsets and the wearer's ability to retain spatial awareness. Remember, the glasses are not a standalone device with its own operating system. They're simply an external monitor reshaped into something more pocketable. And thanks to the transparency of the lenses, you'll never feel like you're drawn into another reality when you have them on.ZDNET's buying adviceAt the time of writing, the Viture One XR Glasses are selling for $299, and that includes the power adapter, a carrying case, and nose pads at various heights. For the price, I'd recommend these to traveling professionals, gamers, and those who want a more private but accessible display experience. The Viture One XR Glasses won't beat the Meta Quest 3 or Apple Vision Pro, but they bring enough to the table to ease any FOMO you might have as more expensive headsets hit the market.Featured reviews    \\n\\n          I went hands-on with Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6 and it made my OnePlus Open feel outdated\\n         \\n\\n          One of the best soundbars I've tested is not made by Bose or Sonos\\n         \\n\\n          Samsung Galaxy Ring hands-on: Why I'd ditch my Oura for this competing wearable\\n         \\n\\n          Samsung's new Copilot+ PC is one of the best that I've tested\\n            \\n\\n            I went hands-on with Samsung's Galaxy Z Fold 6 and it made my OnePlus Open feel outdated\\n           \\n\\n            One of the best soundbars I've tested is not made by Bose or Sonos\\n           \\n\\n            Samsung Galaxy Ring hands-on: Why I'd ditch my Oura for this competing wearable\\n           \\n\\n            Samsung's new Copilot+ PC is one of the best that I've tested\\n           Editorial standards  Show Comments  \\n          Log In to Comment\\n         Community Guidelines     Related   \\n      I returned my Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 for these XR glasses - and they're 30% off for Prime Day\\n      \\n      These XR glasses gave me three virtual MacBook screens to work with - and they're 20% off for Prime Day\\n      \\n      The RayNeo Air 2 XR glasses are 31% off for Prime Day\\n              ZDNET we equip you to harness the power of disruptive innovation, at work and at home.

Vision Pro is priced starting at $3,499, with orders available now following a February 2 launch.Features\\n4K micro OLED displays with 23 million pixels combined\\nEye and gesture tracking for navigation and control\\nMore than a dozen cameras\\n3D photo and video capture\\nBuilt-in spatial audio\\nOptic ID iris scanning\\nvisionOS operating system\\nExternal battery w/ 2hr battery life\\nApple Vision Pro Hands-OnplayRoundup Last Updated 6 days agoHighlight Recent ChangesYesNoSubscribe for regular MacRumors news and future Apple Vision Pro info.\\nShould You Buy the Vision Pro?\\n\\nAt $3,500, the Vision Pro is prohibitively expensive for most consumers, and reviews have made it clear that it is a device that does not easily fit in to an existing workflow. It is great for watching movies, viewing 3D videos, and using as a display for a Mac, but some people have struggled to find a day-to-day use for the device.\\nAt over 1.3 pounds, the Vision Pro is heavy and fatigue can set in quickly. There are two bands options, but for some, it is hard to wear the headset for long periods of time. There is also an external battery pack to contend with, and the headset is not easy to travel with, especially with Apple's dedicated Travel Case. \\nThe Vision Pro is undoubtedly Apple's most technically advanced product and an incredible feat of engineering that is impressive when it is first viewed, but those considering a purchase should try it at the Apple Store and do a lot of research on what can be done with it before making a purchase. The Vision Pro is excellent for watching movies and consuming content, plus it can be used as a display for a Mac, but it has a limited number of apps and games.\\nIt will be at least a year before Apple comes out with a new version of the Vision Pro, and rumors suggest that the next Vision Pro will be cheaper with lower-end components. Based on the rumors that work on a second-generation model has been temporarily suspended this is a good time to buy the headset. \\n\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro\\n\\n\\nContents\\n\\nShould You Buy the Vision Pro?Apple Vision ProHow to BuyWhat's in the BoxVision Pro ReviewsIssuesHow It WorksDesignDisplayLens InsertsCameras and SensorsNavigationOptic ID3D CameraAudioConnectivityProcessors and RAMStorage SpaceBattery LifevisionOSMac IntegrationVision Pro How TosMedical WarningsWhat's Next for Vision ProSoftwareSmart Glasses?Apple's Long Term AR/VR PlansApple's Health TestingApple Vision Pro Timeline\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro is Apple's augmented and virtual reality headset, a device that has been in development for more than a decade. Vision Pro marks the company's first entrance into a major new product category since the 2015 Apple Watch, and the device launched on February 2, 2024.\\nWhile the Apple Vision Pro is definitely a headset, Apple does not use that word when referring to it. Instead, Apple calls it a spatial computer because of its ability to blend digital content with the physical world. Apple refers to the Vision Pro as the first spatial computing device.\\nApple Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset that displays augmented reality content overlaid on the world around you, and immersive entirely virtual content, but it's worth noting that the headset is not see through. Everything you see is digital. For augmented reality content that does not make your surroundings disappear, Apple uses cameras that map out what's in front of you, translating that into a digital image augmented by virtual elements. \\nFor a virtual reality experience, Apple shuts off those cameras and can make it seem like you are completely isolated from what's going on around you, allowing you to focus solely on what's being displayed on the headset's screens. This shift between the \\\"real\\\" and the \\\"immersive\\\" can be controlled with an on-device Digital Crown. \\nDesign wise, Apple Vision Pro is not unlike a pair of ski goggles, featuring a singular piece of laminated glass for the front that melds into an aluminum alloy frame. A soft, fitted Light Seal attaches magnetically to the frame and conforms to your face to block out light. \\nTwo Audio Straps with built-in speakers are positioned at the sides of the headset, delivering Spatial Audio that blends what you're hearing on the headset with what's going on in the real world. The Audio Straps connect to a 3D knitted headband that holds the Vision Pro in place. Apple designed it to be breathable, cushiony, and stretchy for comfort, and a Fit Dial ensures the headset fits tight against your head. There's also a dual-strap design that evenly distributes the weight between the back and top of the head. Apple plans to offer Light Seals and headbands in multiple sizes, and these components are swappable. \\nInside the frame, there are two micro-OLED displays that deliver over 4K resolution to each eye for a total of 23 million pixels. There's also an external display called EyeSight that projects an image of your eyes so people can tell whether you're using the headset in an immersive mode or if you can see what's going on around you. For glasses wearers, there are custom prescription Zeiss Optical Inserts that can be attached magnetically to the headset's lenses.\\nThere are no controllers for Apple Vision Pro, with the headset instead controlled by eye tracking, hand gestures, and voice commands. An app can be navigated to and highlighted by looking at it and then opened with a tap of the fingers. Scrolling is done with a simple flick of the fingers. \\nMore than a dozen cameras and sensors in Apple Vision Pro map out the world around you, keeping track of your hand and eye movements. Optic ID, which scans your iris with infrared lights and cameras, is used for authentication. Each person has a unique iris pattern, and Optic ID is akin to Face ID and Touch ID. It can be used for unlocking the device, making purchases, and as a password replacement. \\nThere are two Apple silicon chips inside Vision Pro, including the same M2 chip that's in the Mac and a new R1 chip. The M2 chip runs visionOS, executes computer vision algorithms, and provides graphics, while the R1 chip processes input from the cameras, sensors, and microphones. \\nApple Vision Pro can take 3D photos and videos using a built-in camera that's powered by tapping on the top button of the device. Apple says that users can capture videos and photos in 3D and then relive those memories like never before. Vision Pro shows existing photos and videos in large scale, making them more immersive, and with visionOS 2, there is an option to convert 2D photos to 3D photos using depth information. Note that when you are recording video, Vision Pro makes it clear that recording is happening with an animation on the external display.\\nplaySubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.\\nDue to weight constraints, Apple did not put a battery in Apple Vision Pro. Instead, it can be powered by a braided cable that is attached to a battery pack worn at the hip or plugged into an adapter. The battery pack offers up to 2.5 hours of battery life on a single charge. \\n\\nWith Apple Vision Pro, content is displayed in the space around you. You can position apps and windows in mid-air, rearranging them as you see fit, with multiple windows supported. Apple says there's an \\\"infinite canvas\\\" to work with. Apps can be displayed in the actual environment that you're in so you can stay present with what's going on around you, or you can use a more immersive view that shuts out the world and puts content on a virtual background called an Environment.\\nA visionOS operating system runs on Apple Vision Pro, and it has a dedicated App Store with apps designed specifically for the device, but it is also able to run iPhone and iPad apps. You can connect the Vision Pro to a Mac, with the headset serving as a display for the Mac. It works with Bluetooth accessories for text input and control, or you can use virtual typing or dictation for text. \\nThere is a main Home View that has all of your favorite Apple apps like Mail, Messages, Music, Safari, Photos, and more, with your data synced through iCloud. The interface is similar to the iPhone interface, but you can open apps and arrange them virtually. Apple is updating its main apps for visionOS and has created APIs for developers, plus Apple is providing Vision Pro test kits to developers for app testing. Apple Vision Pro offers an immersive experience for entertainment like TV and movies, and the Apple TV app has more than 150 3D titles. Content can be expanded to feel like it's in your own personal theater, complete with spatial audio.\\nFaceTime has been redesigned for Vision Pro. People on the call are shown in large tiles to the headset wearer, while the headset wearer is shown as an accurate digital recreation using their Digital Persona. With FaceTime, Vision Pro users can collaborate on documents with colleagues or share apps with others, and spatial audio makes it clear who is speaking.\\nThe Cinema Environment allows you to watch shows and movies at the frame rate and aspect ratio chosen by the creator, or you can use a nature-themed Environment to make the screen feel 100 feet wide. Apple created Apple Immersive Videos that are 180-degree 3D 8K recordings that put users right inside the action, plus streaming services like Apple TV+ and Disney+ are available on Vision Pro. As for gaming, Vision Pro supports Apple Arcade, with 100 iPad games to be available at launch. Games can be played with Bluetooth game controllers that connect to the headset. \\nNote: See an error in this roundup or want to offer feedback?

Apple is providing demonstrations in all of its Apple retail locations, and while there was initially high demand, retail locations are seeing fewer requests for demos.\\nPricing starts at $3,500 for 256GB of storage space. The ordering process requires a Face ID scan to help customers determine the correct Light Seal and head band fit. Zeiss reading lenses for the Vision Pro cost an additional $99, while custom prescription lens inserts are priced at $149. A valid unexpired prescription from a U.S. eye care professional needs to be uploaded after purchase in order to get custom prescription lens inserts.\\nIn June 2024, Apple expanded Vision Pro availability to China, Hong Kong, Japan, and Singapore, and in July, it launched in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the UK in July.\\nWhat's in the Box\\nThe Vision Pro ships with two bands, the Solo Knit Band and the Dual Loop Band. It also comes with a Light Seal, two Light Seal Cushions in different sizes, an Apple Vision Pro Cover for when the headset is not in use, a Polishing Cloth, a battery, a USB-C charging cable, and a USB-C power adapter.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVision Pro Reviews\\n\\nVision Pro reviews are mixed overall. For the most part, reviewers have been impressed with the hardware and the technology introduced by the Vision Pro, but there are questions about the actual function of the device, the intuitiveness of the gesture-based control, the weight and comfort, and VR in general.\\nplay\\nThe Verge's Nilay Patel offers one of the best Vision Pro overviews. He said it is clear that Apple has the absolute best hardware introduced in a VR headset to date, but there are still major tradeoffs to deal with. Patel found the Vision Pro uncomfortable to wear for long periods of time, and was not a fan of the fit because of its impact on hair and makeup.\\nHe found the Vision Pro to be isolating, and said that the \\\"in there\\\" experience of VR did not come close to the \\\"out there\\\" experience of working in the real world with external devices like the Mac. \\\"You're in there, having experiences all by yourself that no one else can take part in,\\\" Patel wrote. \\\"I've come to agree with what Tim Cook has been saying for so long: headsets are inherently isolating.\\\"\\nplay\\nThe Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern said that the hand gestures captured by cameras in the headset were intuitive, and that navigation made sense. But sometimes the eye tracking didn't respond to movement, and Patel said he found it distracting to have to be looking at what he wanted to manipulate because that's not the experience on a Mac or an iPhone.\\nThe virtual in-the-air keyboard \\\"will drive you mad for anything longer than a short message,\\\" according to Stern. To do any \\\"real work,\\\" users will need a Bluetooth keyboard and mouse. \\nplay\\nThe EyeSight external display was universally disliked by reviewers who found it blurry, unrealistic, and hard to see at best, and creepy at worst. The same goes for Personas. Reviewers did not find them to be an accurate representation of themselves, and others viewing the Personas found them strange and in uncanny valley territory.\\nApple's internal microOLED displays were better received, and reviewers praised the quality, sharpness, and low latency of the display for watching movies, working, and similar tasks. Some pointed out that the color range is more limited than expected, and that there is vignetting at the sides of the display due to the shape of the device. \\nThere's also motion blur, and the cameras work less well in low-light conditions, leading to blurry text and images that are hard to see. That's a problem when the Vision Pro is used in an augmented reality mode, as the cameras are showing a passthrough feed of what's around the wearer. Patel said that it is by far the best video passthrough device to date, but it's still just not as good as looking at the real world. \\nplay\\nThere were no overly impressive app experiences or VR games, though reviewers were impressed with the ability to place windows of any size anywhere in the space around them. Window management is not intuitive, though, and while the Vision Pro can serve as a display for the Mac, users can only set up a single Mac display in visionOS, rather than having a setup that looks like multiple Mac monitors. \\nCNET's Scott Stein was surprised at the lack of blending of virtual and reality in apps or environments given Apple's focus on AR. \\\"I haven't seen virtual things hop on my sofa, or run behind furniture. I haven't placed apps on walls or turned windows into aquariums,\\\" he said. \\\"Apple's ARKit on iOS already can do this, but so far Vision Pro isn't emphasizing these tricks.\\\"\\nReviewers agreed that watching TV and movies was one of the best use cases for the Vision Pro, and Patel said that there is a case to be made for using it as a very expensive TV. There were more mixed reactions to Apple's 3D content, though.\\nStern said that every time she watched one of the 3D 180-degree videos that Apple created for the Vision Pro, she felt nauseous, and Patel also said that spatial videos and other content with a lot of motion can cause nausea. Stein felt that while the videos look impressive, the frame rate and resolution \\\"don't feel good enough to be ultra-real yet.\\\"\\nThe speakers work well and offer decent audio, but they are not isolated and others around the user can hear what's on the headset. Though there are cameras that can capture photos and videos, the quality is not good enough. Stein said he would \\\"never wear the Vision Pro to take photos and videos of [his] family.\\\"\\nNo one minded the battery too much, because the Vision Pro is a headset that is largely meant to be used while seated. Battery life was a bit longer than two hours in most tests, which is in line with what Apple has said.\\nBoth Stern and Patel described the Vision Pro as a clear first-generation product that shows some of the promise of the functionality that might be available as AR and VR technology progress and Apple is able to build a better device. \\nAs the Vision Pro is a niche product, reviewers did not recommend the Vision Pro to the average consumer, and said that most people will not want to spend the $3,500 on it. \\\"The Vision Pro isn't a device I'd recommend to any of my friends or family,\\\" said Stein.\\nMore of reviewers' initial thoughts on the Vision Pro can be found in our review roundup.\\n\\n\\n\\nIssues\\n\\nSome Vision Pro headsets have developed a vertical hairline crack in the middle of the front cover glass, with the crack located above the nose bridge. Reports suggest that these cracks have appeared without the Vision Pro being dropped, and there are enough of the cracks to suggest a hardware manufacturing issue. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHow It Works\\n\\nApple Vision Pro is a \\\"mixed reality\\\" headset, meaning it can display both virtual and augmented reality content. It is not like augmented reality glasses, however, as it is designed to completely cover the eyes and block out all of your surroundings. \\n\\nApple is using exterior and interior cameras for the augmented reality component of the device. The cameras are able to map the space around you and project the real world back to you, so though you're not actually looking at what's around you using see-through glasses, you are effectively seeing an accurate picture of your real world environment. \\nWith this capability, Apple can show you 3D windows, objects, and content in your actual space, or the cameras can be turned off to shut out the world to provide an entirely virtual setting. Apple is focusing on the headset's ability to allow for working, content consumption, gaming, communication and other activities to be done \\\"anywhere\\\" with just the Vision Pro.\\n\\n\\n\\nDesign\\n\\nVision Pro is Apple's wearable \\\"spatial computing\\\" device, and while Apple does not refer to it as a headset, that's exactly what it is. The Apple Vision Pro is worn over the head, and it is a virtual/augmented reality headset similar to the PlayStation VR or Meta Quest. \\n\\nDesign wise, the Vision Pro looks similar to a pair of ski goggles, albeit high-end goggles. It features a laminated glass front, which Apple says was \\\"three-dimensionally formed.\\\" The glass is attached to a curved aluminum alloy frame that wraps around the face. As of now, the headset is only available in silver with matching gray Light Seals and bands. \\nThe frame connects magnetically to a Light Seal that sits on the face, and Apple offers the Light Seal in a range of sizes and shapes to fit different faces. A tight fit with the Light Seal is essential for blocking out light and proper operation of the headset. Apple designed the Light Seal to be flexible so that it can conform to individual face shapes. An ill-fitting Light Seal causes the Vision Pro display to be blurry and it allows light to creep in.\\n\\nAt the side of the headset, there are two audio straps that are equipped with speakers that support spatial audio. The audio straps connect to a 3D braided fabric Solo Knit Band that secures the headset to the back of the head, with an adjustable dial for tightening it up for a customizable fit. The main braided headband is detachable so users can swap in different sizes, and perhaps different designs if Apple makes those available in the future. \\n\\nThe Vision Pro comes with both the aforementioned Solo Knit Band that fits around the back of the head and a Dual Loop Band that goes around the back of the head and over the top of the head for weight distribution, so users can choose the best fit. The Dual Loop Band has a two-strap design and it is not made of the same braided material as the Solo Knit Band.\\n\\nEarly testers of the Vision Pro have found that the Dual Loop Band is more comfortable as the headset has been described as heavy. Multiple reviews have mentioned the weight of the device and have said that it can be uncomfortable to wear. The Vision Pro weighs between 21.2 and 22.9 ounces (600 and 650 grams) depending on which Light Seal and head band are used on the device.\\nPhysical controls include a Digital Crown at the top that changes your level of \\\"immersion\\\" and to show you more or less of your real world surroundings through \\\"Environments,\\\" and a top button that serves as a camera button for capturing 3D \\\"spatial\\\" videos and photos. \\n\\nOn the left side of the headset, there is a space to attach a braided cable that provides power to the device. The round charging puck looks like an Apple Watch charging puck, but it clicks into the headset securely with a rotation gesture. \\nThe charging cable attaches to either an external battery pack worn at the waist or a power adapter connected to the wall.\\n\\n\\n\\nDisplay\\n\\nApple Vision Pro is equipped with two custom micro-OLED displays that provide a total of 23 million pixels, which Apple says is \\\"more pixels than a 4K TV.\\\" The headset displays feature a 90Hz refresh rate, but there is a 96Hz refresh rate that can be activated when watching 24 fps movies. \\n\\nThe displays have been described as the size of a postage stamp, but specific hardware information is not known yet. \\nThere's also an external \\\"EyeSight\\\" display that shows the headset wearer's eyes to the people in the room around them. The feature is designed to allow people to know if the headset wearer is using a less immersive augmented reality mode or a fully immersive virtual reality mode. \\nThe eye display that is shown on the exterior display comes from an interior camera that is monitoring the wearer's eyes. It can also alert people when you are recording video with the external camera. \\nLens Inserts\\nApple Vision Pro customers who wear glasses can order Zeiss Optical inserts with their prescription. Zeiss lenses are priced at $149 for a custom prescription, or $99 for readers. The lenses attach magnetically to the displays inside the headset, and can be engraved on the edge. \\nZeiss lenses are available for prescriptions within -11.00D to +6.75D, and prescriptions with prisms are not supported at this time. Vision Pro can be used with soft contacts, but it is not compatible with hard contact lenses.\\n\\n\\n\\nCameras and Sensors\\n\\nApple Vision Pro includes 12 cameras and five sensors for monitoring hand gestures and mapping the external environment. \\n\\nTwo of the cameras transmit more than a billion pixels per second to the display to depict the real world around the wearer when using augmented reality mode, while the others are used for head tracking, hand tracking, and real-time 3D mapping. \\nInfrared flood illuminators enhance hand tracking in low-light conditions, and LiDAR depth sensors determine the size and location of objects in the room around you. \\n\\nFour infrared cameras and LED lights are inside the headset for eye tracking purposes. With this technology, the Vision Pro is able to tell exactly where the wearer is looking for navigation purposes. \\nNavigation\\nThere are no physical controls for the Vision Pro. Navigation is done through eye movements, hand gestures, and voice-based commands. In visionOS, for example, you can highlight an element like an app icon by looking at it, using a quick hand gesture to launch the app. \\n\\nBluetooth keyboards, mice, trackpads, and game controllers can be connected to Vision Pro as an alternative navigation method, though these are mainly designed to be used with a connection to the Mac and for Apple Arcade games. \\nEye and gesture-based navigation is demonstrated in onboarding videos that were pulled from the visionOS software. Apple walks users through looking at a system element and selecting it with a tap of the fingers. The headset is able to detect hand movements even when the hands are resting comfortably in the lap.\\nOptic ID\\nThe infrared cameras and LED lights inside the Vision Pro are used for a security feature called Optic ID. Optic ID is similar to Touch ID or Face ID, but it uses iris scanning instead of a facial scan or a fingerprint scan. \\n\\nEach person has a unique iris pattern, which the headset is able to detect to keep sensitive data on the headset secure. Optic ID can be used like Face ID for unlocking the device, authenticating purchases, and as a password alternative. \\n3D Camera\\nApple included an exterior camera that is able to capture 3D video and 3D photos that are viewable in 3D on the Vision Pro. Apple says that these are like reliving a memory in person because of the \\\"incredible depth\\\" that's available. \\n\\nThe camera gives a clear indicator when recording is turned on so that the headset cannot be used to secretly record video.\\nSeveral members of the media have been able to test the spatial video feature on the Vision Pro, and the feature has been described as so lifelike that it's almost creepy. The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern said that it creates intimacy that 2D photos do not, while CNET's Scott Stein said that the videos are easy to record with the iPhone 15 Pro models and look \\\"compellingly realistic.\\\"\\n\\n\\n\\nAudio\\n\\nThere are speakers on either side of the headset, with the speakers built into the straps that are connected to the frame. The speakers feature dual-driver audio pods that are positioned next to each ear, and they are able to analyze a room's acoustic properties to adapt the sound to match the space. \\nThe speakers support spatial audio for an immersive surround sound experience, plus there are also six microphones for phone calls, video calls, and voice commands. \\nThe Apple Vision Pro pairs with the AirPods for a superior audio experience, and the USB-C AirPods Pro released in September 2023 support 20-bit, 48 kHz lossless audio with ultra-low latency when connected to the Vision Pro.\\n\\n\\n\\nConnectivity\\n\\nThe Vision Pro supports Wi-Fi 6, which operates on the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands. It does not include support for the faster Wi-Fi 6E specification that is compatible with the 6GHz band.\\n\\n\\n\\nProcessors and RAM\\n\\nApple Vision Pro is powered by a pair of chips. The main processor is the M2, which is the same chip that was first introduced in the 2022 MacBook Air. It is responsible for processing content, running the visionOS operating system, executing computer vision algorithms, and providing graphical content. The M2 chip that is in the Vision Pro features an 8-core CPU and 10-core GPU. \\n\\nA second R1 chip is responsible for all of the information coming from the cameras, sensors, and microphones. Apple says that it can stream images to the displays within 12 milliseconds, providing a \\\"virtually lag-free\\\" view of the world. \\n\\nThere is a thermal system inside the Vision Pro that is designed to quietly move air through the headset to control heat and optimize performance. \\nStorage Space\\nThe entry-level Vision Pro is equipped with 256GB of storage space, but Apple also offers upgraded options with 512GB and 1TB of storage.\\n\\n\\n\\nBattery Life\\n\\nWith the external battery pack, the Vision Pro can run for up to two and a half hours, with the 2.5 hour rating listed for watching 2D video. Apple says that the Vision Pro lasts for two hours for general usage. Battery packs can be swapped out for additional power on the go, but the device ships with a single battery pack. When plugged in to a power adapter, the Vision Pro can run all day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nvisionOS\\n\\nApple Vision Pro runs visionOS, an operating system that Apple designed specifically for the headset. visionOS is designed to provide an \\\"infinite canvas\\\" with app windows able to go anywhere in the space surrounding the user. \\n\\nApple redesigned apps like Safari, FaceTime, Messages, and more to work in a 3D environment, plus the headset is able to run the full catalog of iPhone and iPad apps. iPhone and iPad apps aren't optimized for 3D, but can be used on the virtual canvas.\\nMovies and TV shows are available through Apple TV+ and other apps, and can be adjusted to look they're on a screen that's \\\"100 feet wide.\\\" visionOS has its own App Store, and specially created immersive 3D content created by Apple. \\nvisionOS is described by Apple as the first spatial operating system because it can be controlled with eyes and hand gestures, with no physical controls necessary.\\nMac Integration\\nvisionOS can be used with a Mac, serving as a display. It works as a giant external display for Mac content, with familiar controls available through connected keyboards, mice, and trackpads.\\n\\nWhen connected to a Mac, the Vision Pro provides a single Mac display, so it is not possible for a setup that looks like you have multiple displays with Mac apps alone. The Mac interface can, however, be used alongside Vision Pro apps for a multi-window experience.\\n\\nYour Mac and Apple Vision Pro: What You Can Do (and What You Can't)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVision Pro How Tos\\n\\n\\nApple Provides Tips For Making Your Persona Look Better\\nThese Are the Gestures Used to Control Vision Pro\\nVision Pro Not Fitting Well?

Customers with these conditions should consult with a healthcare professional before using the Vision Pro, as the headset could aggravate symptoms. \\nHeart conditions\\nMigraines or chronic headaches\\nDizziness or vertigo\\nEye or vision conditions, such as binocular vision conditions\\nPsychological conditions\\nInner ear conditions\\nHistory of dry eyes, itchiness, or swelling of the eyelids \\nSkin allergies or sensitivities\\nSeizures\\nBalance or gait conditions\\nApple adds that pregnant individuals should exercise additional caution when using the Vision Pro due to an increased risk of nausea or loss of balance.\\nApple also warns that the Vision Pro and its battery pack could interfere with nearby electronics, including cardiac pacemakers, hearing aids, and defibrillators.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat's Next for Vision Pro\\n\\nApple has reportedly stopped work on a second-generation version of the Vision Pro headset for the time being to focus its effort on a lower cost model. Apple has been deprioritizing work on a new high-end model and will instead work on a more affordable version with fewer features, though another high-end version of the Vision Pro is still expected at some point.\\nApple is aiming to sell the more affordable Vision Pro at the price of a high-end iPhone, which retails for up to $1,600. The aim was to release it at the end of 2024, but Apple does not yet have a firm prototype. Apple is said to be struggling to find ways to cut down on cost because it wants to keep the high-end display components. \\nTo lower costs, Apple could Apple will eliminate the EyeSight feature and the M-series chip, and use more affordable and lighter weight build materials. \\nApple will likely use larger, lower resolution displays for the more affordable version of the Vision Pro headset. Apple is rumored to be evaluating OLED panels that are up to 2.1 inches in size with a display density of around 1,700 pixels per inch. The Vision Pro has a 1.42-inch display with a pixel density per inch of almost 3,400.\\nThe cheaper Vision Pro could require a tethered iPhone or Mac to operate, which would allow Apple to save money on processing power and components needed to make it a standalone device. \\nSoftware\\nThe Vision Pro is set to gain Apple Intelligence features at some point in the future, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. Apple Intelligence will come to the headset, but not in 2024, so it may be a feature that Apple is saving for visionOS 3 in 2025. The Vision Pro is powerful enough to run on-device Apple Intelligence features like writing tools, notification summaries, and the revamped Siri. \\nSmart Glasses?\\nApple wants to make advanced AR glasses that are based on the Vision Pro headset in the future, but the hardware technology does not exist for such a product as of yet. Apple has instead considered creating a pair of smart glasses that would compete with Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses and Amazon's Echo Frames. \\nThe glasses could perhaps serve as an AirPods replacement, featuring built-in speakers, cameras, health sensors, and AI capabilities. Apple is still working on the idea and it is not a product that will launch anytime soon.\\n\\n\\nApple's Long Term AR/VR Plans\\n\\n\\nApple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes that Apple could be planning augmented reality \\\"contact lenses\\\" that could launch sometime in the 2030s. According to Kuo, the lenses will bring electronics from the era of \\\"visible computing\\\" to \\\"invisible computing.\\\" There is \\\"no visibility\\\" for the contact lenses at the current time, and it's not a guaranteed product that Apple will develop.\\nApple was also developing augmented reality \\\"Apple Glasses\\\" that were supposed to launch a year or so after the headset, but the project has been placed on hold so the company can instead focus on a cheaper version of the AR/VR headset. Apple Glasses are expected to launch in 2027 at the earliest.\\nA future version of the AR/VR headset could have accessibility settings that are designed to help people who suffer from eye diseases and visual issues. \\nApple's Health Testing\\nIn the future, the Vision Pro could be used to diagnose and treat mental health issues. Apple has tested using the Vision Pro to track a user's facial expressions to detect depression, anxiety, stress, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and other issues. \\nApple believes that eye-tracking, pupil dilation, and external cameras can measure a person's \\\"affect,\\\" a psychological term that refers to how an individual expresses emotions.

The effort notably does not require viewers to utilize a mobile device to view the interactive elements.\\u00a0\\nThe effort was created with production studio DOOH.com, media agencies GroupM OOH and Wavemaker and creative agency Fold7. The latest move by Audible supports the company\\u2019s first-ever global marketing campaign that launched in June.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDive Insight:\\u00a0\\nAudible is bringing storybooks to life with an OOH effort that is expected to be seen by over 60 million people in what is being described as the world\\u2019s largest global AR campaign to date, per release details. The effort represents an extension of Audible\\u2019s first-ever global marketing campaign that launched June 3 under the tagline \\u201cThere\\u2019s more to imagine when you listen.\\u201d\\u00a0\\nFurthering that tagline, the AR campaign is meant to demonstrate how the act of putting on a pair of headphones can fuel your imagination and transport you to a version of reality different from your own. To create the experience, production studio DOOH.com used 4K all-weather cameras at each location to take live images of the view behind each of the screens being utilized to create a window illusion displaying a cityscape background on screen. The screen will then transform into worlds inspired by Audible Original and exclusive titles.\\u00a0\\nTitles on display include sci-fi thriller \\u201cProject Hail Mary\\u201d and classic fairy-tale retelling \\u201cThe Little Mermaid.\\u201d In New York City\\u2019s Times Square \\u2014 a flagship location for the ad \\u2014 viewers will see an underwater scene filled with jellyfish, for example. Key to the experience is the use of GroupM\\u2019s WinDOOH technology, which allows for a more accessible consumer experience not reliant on mobile devices, unlike many other AR experiences. The campaign marks the first time WinDOOH has been used on a global scale, per release details.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAudible\\u2019s out-of-home activation seen at London\\u2019s Meridian Steps.\\nCourtesy of Audible\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nThe campaign will run for four weeks across the U.S. and Canada and for two weeks across the U.K., with 12 total screens displaying the ad across iconic locations that also include Washington D.C 's National Harbor and London\\u2019s Meridian Steps. The effort marks another activation as part of Audible\\u2019s recent global campaign, with other moves under the effort also including social media activations and tie-ups with authors, creators, performers and influencers.\\u00a0\\nAR has become a popular marketing tool, utilized in recent efforts from brands ranging from Coca-Cola to Honda to Snickers. Beyond its latest move, other marketing from Audible has included a \\u201cFly Audible\\u201d campaign inclusive of a 30-second spot inviting viewers to Hogwarts, Gilead, Mars and other destinations of fiction.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npost\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nshare\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\npost\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nprint\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nemail\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nlicense\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFiled Under:\\nBrand Strategy, \\nCreative\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMarketing Dive news delivered to your inbox\\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\\n\\n\\nEmail:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSelect Newsletter:\\n\\n\\nDaily Dive\\nM-F\\n\\n\\n\\nSelect Newsletter:\\n\\n\\nMobile Weekly\\nEvery Thursday\\n\\n\\n\\nSelect Newsletter:\\n\\n\\nAgencies Weekly\\nEvery Monday\\n\\n\\n\\nSelect user consent:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    By signing up to receive our newsletter, you agree to our\\n    Terms of Use and\\n    Privacy Policy.

While some frames cater to open-ear audio or AI assistance, AR smart glasses like the VITURE (pronounced \\u201cvihh-chure\\u201d) Pro XR act like portable monitors \\u2014 capable of projecting a large virtual display perfect for gaming or watching TV and movies.There\\u2019s plenty of AR glasses competition from brands like Rokid, XREAL, and RayNeo. However, VITURE\\u2019s combination of quality hardware and easy-to-use software has typically seen the brand labeled as the most well-rounded offering on the market \\u2014 although that does come hand-in-hand with being one of the more expensive options available. Do the company's latest Pro XR smart glasses continue to impress? Let\\u2019s find out.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: DesignWhile smart glasses can come in a range of designs, with the Solos AirGo 3 particularly excelling when it comes to frame diversity, most AR/XR smart glasses attempt to style themselves on the classic Wayfarer style \\u2014 though this look is only authentically available with the Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.However, VITURE has captured the essence of Ray-Ban\\u2019s iconic frames pretty well while making obvious adjustments to house the tech within. These glasses very much feel like they might be the Wayfarers of tomorrow. Chunkier temples feature open-ear stereo speakers and an action button and volume rocker on the underside of the left arm.VITURE's Pro XR Glasses are styled like a gently futuristic redesign of Ray-Ban's iconic Wayfarer sunglasses. They're a little chunky in places, and fall victim to the same \\\"floating off your face\\\" look that other AR glasses do, however, they remain comfortable even over long spans and don't look half bad when worn. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)A similar increase in bulk is found across the top of the frames, which is needed to make room for each eye\\u2019s bottom-firing micro-OLED display projections \\u2013 and sadly maintains the quirky \\u201clifting off the face\\u201d look that many AR glasses suffer from. These projections land on secondary, prism-like lenses found behind the main electrochromic film lenses, which can be activated with a single press of the action button to block out up to 99.5% of external light and enhance immersion while in use.The prism-like secondary lenses may take some getting used to at first, and while there\\u2019s a clear visual definition between the two, it can be jarring. Eventually, your eyes tune out their presence \\u2014 though their surface is much more reflective than the main lenses. This can manifest some distracting mirroring in brighter environments while the glasses aren\\u2019t in use or the display is anchored to the corner of your sight.Unlike other AR glasses that require sometimes costly lens inserts for vision adjustment, VITURE's Pro XR glasses include twin myopia adjustment dials to ensure you can see the virtual displays with crystal clarity without your regular prescription lenses. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)Two myopia adjustment dials, also present on the chunkier front frames, aid those with nearsightedness. These dials allow you to fine-tune the focus for each eye (0.0D to -5.0D) and ensure you\\u2019re getting the most crisp results possible from the virtual displays.Finally, these lightweight (77 grams) frames feature a proprietary magnetic pin connection at the end of the right temple tip, which allows hassle-free connection to the glasses\\u2019 USB Type-C data cable, which connects to your device of choice.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: SetupIf you want to use VITURE Pro XR glasses with home or handheld consoles like the PS5, Nintendo Switch, Asus ROG Ally, or Steam Deck, you\\u2019ll need to invest in the VITURE Pro Mobile Dock.Using the glasses themselves is simple. Connecting the aforementioned USB Type-C cable to the right temple tip and any compatible device (Windows, Mac, iOS, and Android, featuring a USB-C DisplayPort/DP Alt Mode-supporting port) instantly activates screen mirroring as the glasses\\u2019 micro-OLED projectors kick in.You don\\u2019t need to worry about drivers or software with this use case. The VITURE Pro XR smart glasses essentially act as a plug-and-play monitor. However, this will only result in a static virtual display with little to no customization available for positioning the screen or engaging in 3DoF (Three Degrees of Freedom), AR-like interactions.The VITURE Mobile Dock allows you to unleash the true potential of your handheld console/gaming PC by presenting the same large-picture virtual displays and providing 13,000 mAh of additional charge to your device. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)If you want to use VITURE Pro XR glasses with home or handheld consoles like the PS5, Nintendo Switch, Asus ROG Ally, or Steam Deck, you\\u2019ll need to invest in the VITURE Pro Mobile Dock ($129). This accessory unlocks 3D content support and acts as a docking station (that allows two VITURE smart glasses to be connected simultaneously and HDMI connections) and a portable power bank with a 13,000 mAh battery.\\u00a0VITURE Pro XR Glasses: SoftwareTo use those more advanced visual features, you\\u2019ll need to download and install the SpaceWalker app. SpaceWalker is available for iOS/iPadOS, Android, and now Windows, giving users a spatial sandbox that includes a web browser and media player. While that doesn\\u2019t sound like much, it is enough to be able to make use of web versions of apps like YouTube, Netflix, and Prime Video.The benefit of doing this through SpaceWalker is that VITURE\\u2019s app also allows for 3DoF tracking, allowing you to turn away from your virtual screen or more comfortably view content. SpaceWalker also allows media or web pages to be clipped to the corners of your view and scaled in size to suit your needs.This can let you prepare and cook a meal while following along with a video tutorial that doesn\\u2019t impede your full vision, or catch up on some YouTube videos while getting around town without worrying about bowling over the locals because your entire field of vision was being taken up with \\u201cMemes for the Boys part 62.\\u201dSpaceWalker for Windows and macOS unlocks a more familiar spatial computing experience, where the Pro XR's headtracking is put to use to add an extra dimension to your virtual displays with full 3DoF rendering. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)SpaceWalker for macOS is a whole other ballgame. Here, you\\u2019ll be able to engage in a much truer spatial computing experience. Connecting the VITURE smart glasses to a MacBook running SpaceWalker unlocks a multitude of virtual display options, including stunning ultrawide 21:9 floating displays and the ability to shrink and grow the scale of displays with ease.The Windows version of SpaceWalker has only recently been released and can be a little buggy at times. However, it\\u2019s safe to expect that VITURE will bring the app up to speed in the coming months.There\\u2019s no current rival to VITURE\\u2019s offerings on the software front, at least not from smart glasses manufacturers themselves (though there are some excellent pieces of third-party software available online). While XREAL has the most similar offering in terms of design, style, picture, and audio, VITURE is one of the only AR smart glasses companies to deliver such compelling, widely-supported, easy-to-use, and impactful software.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: DisplayAR glasses like VITURE\\u2019s use an interesting projection method to present virtual screens before your eyes. Rather than the image appearing directly on the lens, two Sony micro-OLED panels beam an image into a secondary lens that redirects each image toward your eyes.The result is quite impressive, to say the least. With a bright, 135-inch virtual panel before you at all times. There\\u2019s a full-HD (1920 x 1080) per-eye resolution to enjoy with refresh rates of up to 120Hz \\u2014 which is especially excellent for speedy, responsive gaming through the glasses.The Pro XR's twin lenses can be hard to adjust to at first, vision through the glasses won't ever be 100% comfortable when you're not making use of the micro-OLED displays, but it's by no means impossible to acclimatize to. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)One downside to the AR glasses form factor is that your FoV (Field of View) is more restricted than when using a VR/AR headset like the Meta Quest 3. The Pro XR glasses have a narrower 46-degree FoV, resulting in a more tightly packed area from which you can view the projected image. In contrast, the Quest 3\\u2019s pancake lenses offer a much larger 110-degree FoV, offering over twice the screen space with which to enjoy content.Pictures are bright and crisp, and whether I was watching movies or playing games, I never felt the glasses lacking in visual quality or performance. Better still, watching 3D content on the glasses is absolutely stunning and simple to perform. Simply holding down the action button on the left temple switches to SBS (Side-by-Side) vision, allowing the full 3D experience in games and media.Capturing the virtual displays through the lenses is a tricky task, and this picture by no means does the unwarped, crisp, and clear presentation of the virtual screens any justice. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)The VITURE Pro XR smart glasses are excellent for gaming. They deliver speedy refresh rates and capture the striking and varied colors of CD Projekt Red\\u2019s Cyberpunk 2077. The enormous virtual display pulls you further into titles, and your immersion is peaked when you enable the electrochromic lenses that block out the surrounding light almost entirely.\\u00a0VITURE Pro XR Glasses: AudioThe VITURE Pro XR\\u2019s audio's open-ear design lets you enjoy media or games without shutting off the rest of the world. The Harmon-tuned audio is definitely rich in quality, and the audio bleed is very well-contained.Setting the glasses down while playing a range of music videos and movies at peak volume, I lost track of much of the audio at only a few feet in distance. This makes them ideal for commutes or on-the-go watching, as you won\\u2019t be annoying those around you by unwantedly blaring the contents of your watchlist in their general direction.The open-ear speakers housed within the Pro XR's temples offer excellent audio, though they do fall short against other AR glasses when it comes to maximum volume. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)However, that\\u2019s likely because the VITURE Pro XR\\u2019s speakers are relatively quiet compared to others. The XREAL Air 2 glasses are also open-ear in design but offer much more of a kick, making them better suited for noisier or less isolated environments. This does, however, negatively impact the frames when it comes to audio bleed.All in all, the Pro XR\\u2019s speakers strike a fair balance and are more than enjoyable while at home or in less bustling locations. For those who want to dial things up to 11, there\\u2019s always the option to switch over to a pair of Bluetooth earbuds or headphones.VITURE Pro XR Glasses: Price and availabilityThe VITURE Pro XR smart glasses are available for $549, though currently discounted to $459 for early adopters.At face value, that\\u2019s a sizeable sum for a pair of high-tech shades, though it\\u2019s not an uncommon price for smart glasses of its ilk. The $399 XREAL Air 2 AR glasses offer similar features, but options like the VITURE Pro XR\\u2019s electrochromic film lenses are reserved for the more expensive $449 Air 2 Pro model.VITURE's Pro XR Glasses (front) are a step up from XREAL's Air 2 AR glasses (rear), offering an electrochromic panel that can be activated to blank out all but the brightest of lights and greatly improve immersion. (Image credit: Laptop Mag / Rael Hornby)However, XREAL\\u2019s offerings lack the myopia adjustment dials of VITURE\\u2019s glasses, leaving some glasses wearers needing to rely on potentially expensive lens inserts to see the virtual displays clearly.Of course, at that price, it\\u2019s worth considering the expanded functions and capabilities of VR/AR headsets like the $499 Meta Quest 3. That being said, the improvements to the overall AR experience from the Quest 3 will come at the cost of a bulkier, heavier, and less welcoming form factor.\\u00a0Bottom lineVITURE\\u2019s AR smart glasses offering is a well-rounded assortment of accessories and software that pushes the AR/XR experience that frames like this can deliver. There\\u2019s truly no smoother or fleshed-out experience as the one offered here \\u2014 at least for now.Forget spatial computing. Pick up a pair of VITURE's Pro XR glasses and give facial computing a try instead.My only major gripe is that the complete experience is costly. VITURE\\u2019s frames alone have an intimidating price tag to some, so having to invest even more to get the most from your handheld or home console may be asking too much of general consumers.However, as a plug-and-play pair of AR smart glasses, the core product is still considerably impressive, thanks to the awesome SpaceWalker software available across mobile and desktop platforms.Yes, the AR experience is a little more expansive and impressive through the lenses of a VR/AR headset. However, they're far less accommodating when it comes to comfort or wearing while out and about. As such, unless you're looking to take advantage of VR/AR gaming, forget spatial computing. Pick up a pair of VITURE's Pro XR glasses and give facial computing a try instead.More from Laptop MagWhat are smart glasses?

Largest Global Augmented Reality Ad Campaign \\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Rolling out on July 15, the out-of-home (OOH) campaign is the world\\u2019s largest global AR campaign ever, to be seen by over 60 million people globally. The innovative advertising is a component of Audible\\u2019s\\u00a0recently launched first-ever global brand marketing campaign, which established a consistent voice across all marketplaces and audience touchpoints for the company. The brand execution explores how listening to Audible immerses us all in extraordinary worlds and changes our mood, perceptions, views \\u2013 all while engaging in routine daily activities. In this ground-breaking OOH element of the campaign, Audible uses innovative WinDOOH technology to simulate how the simple act of putting your headphones on can kickstart your imagination and transport you from your everyday life.\\n\\u00a0\\nUsing 4k all-weather cameras at each location, DOOH.com, the production studio on the project, took live images of the view behind each screen. Through this, the team created a window illusion displaying this cityscape background on screen. The screen is then transformed into varying fantastical worlds inspired by popular Audible Original and exclusive titles, such as sci-fi hit \\u201cProject Hail Mary\\u201d and classic fairy tale retelling \\u201cThe Little Mermaid.\\u201d Times Square in New York City, a flagship location for the ad, showcases a mesmerizing underwater scene populated with stunning jellyfish designed to captivate viewers amidst the hustle and bustle.\\n\\u00a0\\nThis is the first time WinDOOH, or \\u2018mass participation AR,\\u2019 has been used on a global scale, running on screens for four weeks across the US and Canada and for two weeks across the UK. The ad graces a total of twelve screens in iconic locations from New York City\\u2019s Times Square to Washington DC\\u2019s National Harbor to London\\u2019s Meridian Steps, using the newest technology in the OOH space.\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u201cOur recently launched global brand campaign exemplifies the transportive power of Audible for our listeners,\\u201d said James Finn, Global Head of Brand & Content Marketing, Audible. Added Tom McKenna, Global Head of Media & Marketing Ops, Audible: \\u201cThis cutting-edge technology is a perfect fit to showcase the different worlds Audible brings to life for our customers around the globe.\\u201d\\n\\u00a0\\n\\u201cWhen you listen to a story on Audible, you\\u2019re transported from your daily life. We\\u2019ve designed this campaign to reflect that experience through fantastical worlds, brought to life by WinDOOH,\\u201d said Andrew Phipps Newman, CEO at DOOH.com \\u201cUtilizing advanced AR technology, cameras were placed behind screens to capture real-time images, creating the illusion of a live background. Unlike traditional AR OOH executions, GroupM\\u2019s WinDOOH does not require viewers to use mobile devices to view the interactive elements. Instead, cameras integrated into the screens blend high-end visual effects, graphics, and animations with real-world video feeds. This innovation allows anyone viewing the screen to experience the AR elements with the naked eye.\\u201d\\nFor more such updates, follow us on Google News Martech News\\n Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedInTotal: 0 \\nDisplay & Programmatic Advertisingdisplay and programmatic advertisingmartechmartech newsprogrammatic displayprogrammatic display adsprogrammatic display advertising Previous ArticleCovideo Releases New AI Capabilities for DealershipsNext ArticleTricentis announced the acquisition of SeaLights\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecent Posts\\nMarTech Interview with Wayne Vandekraak, Chief Sales Officer at OptConnectMTC NEWS DESK32 mins agoJuly 18, 20240\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaximize the Value of Your Data With Data Lifecycle ManagementMTC NEWS DESK1 hour agoJuly 18, 20240\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFetch Strengthens Exec Team, Minting New Chief Product & People OfficersPRNewswire3 hours agoJuly 18, 20240\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCensus Acquires Fulcrum to Enhance Data Collaboration and ModelingBusinessWire3 hours agoJuly 18, 20240\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFoundever Elevates CX, Increases Operational Efficiency with C1 OnGuardPRNewswire3 hours agoJuly 18, 20240\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRecommended for you MarTech Interview with Wayne Vandekraak, Chief Sales Officer at OptConnect\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMaximize the Value of Your Data With Data Lifecycle Management\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFetch Strengthens Exec Team, Minting New Chief Product & People Officers\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCensus Acquires Fulcrum to Enhance Data Collaboration and Modeling\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFoundever Elevates CX, Increases Operational Efficiency with C1 OnGuard\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUnbounce & Insightly join forces to align sales & marketing functions\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nWe recognized the need to address the technology challenges specific to a CMO and the marketing department.

The challenge was making their optic technology consumer-ready\\u2014compact, stylish and affordable, according to Goldman.\\n\\u201cWe use mirrors, which are the oldest optical element that exists, and we\\u2019re using them in a unique way,\\u201d he says.\\u00a0\\nWhile keeping the tiny projector out of the way, content is projected onto what is called a waveguide, so called because it directs the light waves.\\u00a0\\nThis glass substrate (underlying layer), with embedded partially reflecting mirrors, is where the light gets guided through the piece of glass and projected to the users\\u2019 eyes.\\n\\u201cIf you wanted to watch a movie, or if you wanted to do gaming, it would be possible,\\u201d\\u00a0 Goldman says.\\u00a0\\u201cWe can do that with our optics, and those will fit in what looks like a natural pair of glasses.\\u201d\\nThe waveguide is the only part of the smart glasses that doesn\\u2019t exist in another device, Goldman explains. For example, the micro display and the projector are technologies that are part either of smartwatches, mobile phones or screen monitors.\\u00a0\\nThe only new piece of technology for the AR glasses is going to be the waveguide, and that\\u2019s why it\\u2019s so critical, Goldman says.\\n\\u201cIn Israel we have a good reputation in optics from the Weizmann Institute [of Science]. Most of our research has come out of there and we are leaders in this space, which is good for Israel,\\u201d he adds.\\u00a0\\u00a0Sign up for our free weekly newsletterSubscribe\\nThe tech used in the Lumus AR glasses includes display and projector found in smartwatches and cell phones (Photo: Courtesy) \\nIn fact, a good number of Lumus\\u2019 97 employees hold doctorates in physics, optics and other relevant areas of studies.\\u00a0\\nLumus is located in the Israeli city of Ness Ziona, neighboring Weizmann\\u2019s hometown of Rehovot. The two locales form the base of a growing number of manufacturing, production and technology transfer organizations.\\u00a0\\nThe company also has a production line in Penang, Malaysia through Germany\\u2019s SCHOTT, a leading international technology group in the areas of material innovations, specialty glass and glass-ceramics. It has another production facility in Taipei, Taiwan through its partner and Fortune 500 company Quanta Computer, which produces many consumer products including the Apple watch and the MacBook Pro.\\u00a0\\nAnd there is an appetite for this tech among consumers, mostly younger consumers under 40, Goldman asserts.\\n\\u201cThis market is going to come. The companies are very committed to it. They\\u2019re spending billions of dollars on R&D right now, not just in America, but also in China, in Taiwan, to some degree, but less so, in Europe,\\u201d he says.\\u00a0\\nHe estimates that smart glasses will be on the market within a few years for the early adopters. After that, he says, we will see \\u201cmillions of units\\u201d become available.\\u00a0\\nAs such, Lumus is working with their manufacturing partners on building a supply chain robust enough to handle millions of orders that he is optimistic will come once consumers become more used to the concept.\\n\\u201cWe are poised to go now, though initially it won\\u2019t be millions of sales. It\\u2019s a really big ask to go from using a mobile device to suddenly using a display near the eye, and so it\\u2019s going to start in the tens of thousands of orders a month, then to hundreds of thousands a month, and eventually\\u2026 millions,\\u201d he predicts.\\nLumus is at various stages with various customers whose names he is unable to reveal at this time, he says. In some cases, they are working on a real product with a target date for release and in others, they are doing pilot programs with large technology companies or just evaluating whether they want to use Lumus or one of their competitors.\\nGoldman explains that the Lumus AR glasses allow the wearer to remain in the present while using the technology, making it an asset rather than a distraction.\\n\\u201cWe don\\u2019t want you to be separated from the world,\\u201d he says. \\u201cIf we were to meet face to face, and you forgot my name, you would see my name through the glasses \\u2013 it would be floating just above my head.\\u201d\\u00a0\\nHe ticks off some of the other improvements he believes AR glasses will help with, including real-time translations, seamless navigation without ever taking your eyes off the road, and 3D projected holograms of the people you are talking via video calls, giving you the sensation of being in the same room.\\n\\u201cIt\\u2019s a quantum leap,\\u201d he says.\\nThe Lumus AR glasses sport the heavy frames made popular by designer brands (Photo: Courtesy) \\nHighlighting the company\\u2019s discreet optical engine weighing in at about 11 grams per eye and the lightweight design aimed at mimicking conventional eyewear aesthetics, Goldman says the eyewear is practically indistinguishable from some of the heavier-framed glasses favored by designers such as Armani.\\n\\u201cThat was the goal. And for the kinds of companies that we\\u2019re working with now, it has to look good,\\u201d he says.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\u201cIt won\\u2019t be considered wearable if no one wants to wear it, right? So, we have an expression here- \\u2018the face is sacred space.\\u2019 No one wants to wear anything that makes them look like a dork.\\u201d\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSubscribe to NoCamels weekly newsletter and get our top stories\\n\\nRelated posts\\n\\n\\n\\nNegev Innovation Hub Cultivates Environmental Tech In Desert Climes\\n\\nJuly 18, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith Surgical Precision, AI Platform Cuts Wasted Operating Room Time\\n\\nJuly 16, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nStartup Can Read Our Thoughts From Our Involuntary Actions\\n\\nJuly 11, 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAI Platform Lets Organizations Dive Deep Into Their Own Data\\n\\nJuly 10, 2024\\n \\n\\n\\nFacebook comments\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWeekly Newsletter\\n\\n\\nNOCAMELS\\nWeekly Highlights\\nStraight To Your Inbox\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nVideo Storieslike usNoCamels -

The Manifest service displays these guides as spatially anchored assets that workers can interact with while undergoing a procedure. \\u00a0John Tomizuka, the Co-founder and Chief Technical Officer at Taqtile, spoke on the Manifest version 2.0 update, adding:\\u00a0Supporting Apple Vision Pro and its game-changing spatial computing capabilities is going to make it easier to create superior work instructions that will make deskless employees more effective and more efficient. With the addition of AI and other technical enhancements, the new version of Manifest Maker is more powerful, simpler to use, and a more valuable option for industrial users.New Hardware, genAI, and 3D Model Optimisation \\u00a0The most recent version of Manifest Maker includes many new optimisations. Namely, the service is gaining new hardware optimizations for industrial users, bringing Manifest to the white-hot Apple Vision Pro, iPad, and iPhone.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\nMoreover, the new genAI features allow the platform to automatically create linear, procedural step-by-step guidance visualisations based on a pre-recorded video footage feed of workers performing procedures. The integration allows Maker\\u2019s AI to analyse clips of expert operators performing onsite procedures to create additional working learning content, therefore\\u00a0promoting skill sharing throughout an organisation.Maker also improves the integration and utilization of detailed 3D models. Now, mentors can leverage 3D visualisations of training resources to enhance further upskilling initiatives, such as learning repair and maintenance procedures. \\u00a0According to the firm, workers can take photos of industrial objects using an Apple device to turn those real-life objects into a 3D learning tool [digital twin]. \\u00a0More on Manifest MakerIn 2022, Manifest introduced the Maker solution. This application allows experts to add insights and instructions to their recordings using accompanying videos, screenshots, images, auto-transcribed text, and scans of existing manuals to improve their training guides.When on-site experts create their AR guides, they can distribute their work quickly using simple tools. Taqtile utilizes simple drag-and-drop pipeline tools, still image creation tools, auto-transcription features, automated dictation, and paper manual scanning to facilitate easy content creation.Taqtile anticipates that users will utilize Manifest Maker to aid in operational, maintenance, and repair procedures, such as replacing failed components in industrial equipment or inspecting fleets of vehicles. \\n\\n\\nAR Smart GlassesAssisted RealityField Service \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFeatured\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAugmented Reality\\n\\n                The Latest Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Smash Sales Expectations            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAugmented Reality\\n\\n                VIVERSE Expands Access to Polygon Streaming            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAugmented Reality\\n\\n                Smart Glasses Banned for Japan Uni Entrance Exams            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAugmented Reality\\n\\n                Will this Smart Glasses Vendor Enhance Healthcare Collaboration?            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAugmented Reality\\n\\n                Will AR Smart Glasses Over Take VR Headsets?            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAugmented Reality\\n\\n                Is Microsoft Transitioning from an XR Hardware to Software Provider?            \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nShare This Post\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRelated\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAugmented Reality\\n\\n                The Latest Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses Smash Sales Expectations            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAugmented Reality\\n\\n                VIVERSE Expands Access to Polygon Streaming            \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nAugmented Reality\\n\\n                Smart Glasses Banned for Japan Uni Entrance Exams            \\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nGet our Free Weekly Newsletter, straight to your inbox!\\nHandpicked News, Reviews and Insights delivered to you every week.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSign up\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTech\\nVirtual Reality News\\nMixed Reality News\\nAugmented Reality News\\nMetaverse News\\n \\n\\nIndustries\\nHealthcare\\nEducation\\nTraining\\nCollaboration\\nRetail\\n \\n\\nTrending Topics\\nMetaverse\\nVR Headsets\\nAI\\nBlockchain\\nWeb3\\n \\n\\nFeatured Brands\\nMeta\\nMicrosoft\\nMagic Leap\\nGoogle\\n \\n\\nAbout\\nAbout Us\\nContact\\nPrivacy Policy\\n \\n\\nMore\\nNews Desk\\nMedia Kit\\nBrand\\nLegal\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAll content \\u00a9 Today Digital 2024\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\",\n        \"type\": \"Document\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"lc\": 1,\n      \"type\": \"constructor\",\n      \"id\": [\n        \"langchain\",\n        \"schema\",\n        \"document\",\n        \"Document\"\n      ],\n      \"kwargs\": {\n        \"metadata\": {\n          \"source\": \"https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2024/07/16/world/society/ar15-america-popular-guns/\",\n          \"title\": \" The AR-15: One of America's most popular and deadliest guns -

Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset (Apple calls it a \\u201cSpatial Computer\\u201d) that marries an M2 processor with a lot of custom silicon, sensors, cameras, and more. The starting price of $3,499 means that it\\u2019s a niche product, but it\\u2019s the first in a new category that Apple believes will be critical in the coming years.\\nUpdate July 12: Vision Pro is now available in the U.K., Canada, Australia France, and Germany.\\n\\nApple Vision Pro: Worldwide availability\\nAfter the U.S. launch in February 2024, Apple had said that the Vision Pro would be shipping to \\u201cmore countries\\u201d later in 2024. At WWDC Apple announced which countries and when: \\n\\nChina (mainland): June 28\\nHong Kong: June 28\\nJapan: June 28\\nSingapore: June 28\\nAustralia: July 12\\nCanada: July 12\\nFrance: July 12\\nGermany: July 12\\nU.K.: July 12\\n\\nVision Pro is now available to purchase in all of the above countries and the U.S. It\\u2019s unclear when or if Apple plans to launch the new headset in other countries beyond these.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro: Price and availability\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Read our review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe headset was first announced at WWDC on June 5, 2023, with pre-orders starting January 19, 2024, and availability in the U.S. only on February 2. The starting price is $3,499 for 256GB of storage, with a 512GB model available for $3,699 and a 1TB model for $3,899. \\nNow that Apple has started to sell the Vision Pro outside the U.S. we have the price for those other territories:\\n\\n\\nChina: 29,999 yuan\\nHong Kong: HK$27,999\\nJapan: 599,800 yen\\nSingapore: S$5,299\\nAustralia: A$5,999 inc. GST\\nCanada: $4,999 (CAD)\\nFrance: \\u20ac3 999 \\nGermany: \\u20ac3.999\\nU.K.: \\u00a33,499\\n\\nYou can only buy a Vision Pro online directly from Apple\\u2019s website, by using the Apple Store app on your iPhone, or at an Apple Store. Part of the reason for this is the necessity to get a proper fit and optical insert if needed. Apple takes a scan of your face (you do this yourself with your iPhone if you are buying online) to select a proper face seal size. If you wear prescription eyewear or need readers, you can order special Zeiss inserts for $99/\\u00a399 (readers) or $149/\\u00a3149 (prescription). The headset is not designed to work with your existing eyewear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\n\\nApple\\n\\n\\nApple\\nThere are also other accessories available for purchase, including a travel case ($199/\\u00a3199), battery ($199/\\u00a3199), Belkin Battery Holder ($50/\\u00a349.95), Solo knit Band ($99/\\u00a399), Dual Loop Band ($99/\\u00a399), Light Seal ($199/\\u00a3199), and Light Seal Cushion ($29/\\u00a325). AppleCare+ is also available for $499/\\u00a3499 for two years.\\n\\n\\nWill there be a cheaper Apple Vision Pro? \\nWe take the fact that the Vision Pro has the word \\u201cPro\\u201d in its name as a big hint that a more affordable version will be coming down the line. An \\u201cApple Vision Air,\\u201d if you will. \\nApple is thought to be working on two new Vision products: a refreshed high-end \\u201cPro\\u201d model with enhanced capabilities, and a more affordable model that Apple would aim to sell for a price similar to that of a high-end iPhone.\\n\\nNew rumors about the successor to Vision Pro \\u2013 both what it will be and when it will arrive \\u2013 change frequently. They all have one thing in common, though: there isn\\u2019t expected to be any new hardware in 2024. Bloomberg\\u2019s Mark Gurman believes that a cheaper headset will arrive in 2025. He reported in October 2023 that Apple is already working on the sequel to the headset, which will be cheaper than the original model.\\nIn June 2024 a report in The Information claimed that Apple had killed the development of the Vision Pro 2 in order to focus on a lower-cost headset for 2025. However, Apple is said to be struggling to bring down manufacturing costs without cutting back on features and performance too much.\\n\\n\\nThe Vision Pro is likely to follow the example of the HomePod with the expensive pro model paving the way for a cheaper option down the line. But it could be a while before the economies of scale and advancements in technology make a cheaper Apple Vision product viable.\\nApple Vision Pro: Compatibility \\nThe Vision Pro is its own product with its own software ecosystem. It has its own App Store, and runs software independent from other Apple products (though apps like Messages and Photos can sync via iCloud with your other Apple products).\\n\\nThere is support for iPad apps, however. By default, all iPad apps are made available for use on Vision Pro and can be found in the Vision Pro app store, but developers can opt not to allow their apps to be used on the device. White many iPad apps are available, prominent exceptions include YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix.\\nApple Vision Pro: Specs\\nThe Vision Pro is powered by an M2 processor with 8 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores\\u2013the same as you would find in a MacBook. It has 16GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of flash storage.\\n\\n\\nThere are 14 cameras on the inside and outside, a LiDAR scanner, multiple IR illuminators, an accelerometer, gyroscope, and multiple microphones. A custom R1 processor is made to process the vast amount of data from these sensors very quickly, for lightning-fast eye tracking and a delay for the video pass-through of only 12 milliseconds.\\nWhen wearing the Vision Pro you look through custom catadioptric pancake lenses at a pair of micro-OLED displays, one for each eye. About the size of a postage stamp, each of these displays has a stunning resolution of about 3,386 pixels per inch, more than 4K per eye. Of course, what matters is pixels per degree when looking through the lenses, which on Vision Pro is around 34 pixels per degree (less than you\\u2019d see looking at an iPhone display, but more than most other VR headsets).\\nApple does not disclose the field of view for the Vision Pro, but it appears to be somewhere around 110\\u00b0 horizontally and 90\\u00b0 vertically.\\nThe Vision Pro is actively cooled, with a fan inside, but the fan runs so quietly you can\\u2019t hear it.\\n\\n\\nThere are two individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod on the side of the headset near the headband connection. They deliver Personalized Spatial Audio based on the user\\u2019s own head and ear geometry. As a result, the sound feels like it is coming from the space around you. Vision Pro also matches the sound to the room using audio raytracing. \\nThe Vision Pro also recognizes the user\\u2019s iris via a new method to unlock the device and authenticate passwords and purchases called Optic ID. Like the iPhone and Mac, all data is stored on a dedicated Secure\\u00a0Enclave processor.  \\nOn the outside of the headset is an OLED display with a lenticular lens over it that Apple calls EyeSight. It projects a rendered image of your own eyes with correct perspective, so others can see you looking at them. If you are in a fully immersive environment and can\\u2019t see anyone, the EyeSight display shows a blueish haze.\\nBattery life \\nApple Vision Pro connects to an external battery via a custom tether, and the battery lasts for around 2 to 2.5 hours. The battery pack has a USB-C port that can only be used to recharge it, though you can use the Vision Pro with the battery plugged in.\\n\\n\\nWeight and dimensions\\nAccording to Apple Vision Pro tech specs, the headset weighs 21.2 to 22.9 ounces (600 to 650 grams) depending on the Light Seal and headband configuration. That\\u2019s about the weight of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (24 ounces/682\\u00a0grams). It\\u2019s not necessarily heavier than other VR headsets but quite a bit heavier than the Meta Quest 3, which weighs 18.2 ounces (516 grams).\\nThe weight is very front-heavy, mostly in the metal and glass out in the front of the face seal instead of distributed around the sides. The battery pack weighs 12.5 ounces (353 grams). \\nApple Vision Pro: Hands-on and overall experience\\nIn our Apple Vision Pro review, we found the technology very impressive, but the comfort and software\\u2014both apps and operating system\\u2014quite limited. There\\u2019s a lot of potential there, but it will take quite a while for the software to mature enough to unlock it, and for most users, the Vision Pro will never be worth the price. \\nWith a Vision Pro headset users will be able to watch a movie, listen to music, browse photos, look at 3D objects, and even collaborate on a presentation. \\n\\n\\nUsers experience a three-dimensional interface and input system that they control with their eyes, hands, and voice. You select things by looking at them and pinching your fingers together, then dragging objects around or flicking your hand to scroll. A virtual keyboard is used to enter text where appropriate, either by poking at the keys or looking at each key in succession and pinching your fingers together. You can also use voice input to enter text, or a Bluetooth keyboard.\\nApple has posted a 10-minute guided tour explaining how navigation and gestures work as well as several apps.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\n\\nApple\\n\\n\\nApple\\nWhen you first put on Vision Pro you see your surroundings. You can freely move apps to fill the space around you and they can expand into your space. The digital crown lets you adjust the volume or the degree of immersion in your environment\\u2013from fully immersed in a virtual space to seeing \\u201cpass-through\\u201d video of your own space. Here\\u2019s a primer on what the Vision Pro buttons do.\\nA user can bring a Mac wirelessly into the Apple Vision Pro space just by looking at it and choosing to connect to it if it is logged into the same Apple ID. The Mac display will blank out and be replaced by a big 4K virtual display in your Vision Pro environment; you\\u2019ll continue to use the Mac keyboard and touchpad, however, and audio will still play from the Mac.\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro: Software and apps\\nThe Vision Pro headset runs visionOS, an operating system that Apple has designed from the ground up for visual computing. Apple launched a number of native Vision Pro versions of its apps at launch, such as Safari, Messages, and FaceTime. Apple launched Vision Pro with more than 600 optimized apps. The latest version is visionOS 1.1, which includes support for managed profiles, improved Personas, and lots of bug fixes and minor improvements.\\nIn fall 2024, Apple will release visionOS 2, the first major update to the OS. It will bring numerous refinements and upgrades, including the ability to transform regular, 2D photos into spatial photos, and wide and ultra-wide screen views with Mac Virtual Display.\\nApple Vision Pro: Glossary and terminology\\nAs with many Apple products, the company has some of its own branding around things that may be better understood by other names. Here are some of the things you may see associated with Vision Pro and what they mean.\\nSpatial Computing: Computing that appears to happen in the environment around you rather than inside a computer (or phone). A sort of umbrella term that encapsulates AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality), and MR (Mixed Reality). It is not inaccurate to call Vision Pro a mixed-reality headset.\\n\\n\\nSpatial apps: Apps designed with the Vision Pro hardware in mind, as opposed to iPad apps running in a window. Some Spatial apps are fully immersive experiences, others are almost indistinguishable from iPad apps.\\nFully immersive: A \\u201cfully immersive\\u201d experience is one in which your surroundings are not visible: you\\u2019re completely surrounded in a virtual environment. In other words Virtual Reality.\\nSpatial Audio: Audio that seems to come from specific places in your environment. \\nPersona: A 3D digital recreation of you, created by scanning your face using the Vision Pro cameras. It is meant to be used to represent you in video conferencing apps like FaceTime or Zoom since the Vision Pro has no cameras that can actually see your face (just specialized internal cameras for eye tracking).\\n\\n\\nSpatial Video: A new 3D video format that can be captured with either the Vision Pro or an iPhone 15 Pro.

Courtesy of NSS Canada.                                \\n\\n\\nNSS Canada, a Sudbury, Ontario-based mining technology company, has incorporated an augmented reality (AR) display into its underground surveying software.\\u00a0\\nIts proprietary Miner Operated Survey System (MOSS) integrates mine design specifications and drawings, and supplies data in real time, so that users can complete markups of the mine face underground and create a blasting plan. The technology has been on the market since 2017, with clients that include Vale Base Metals, Glencore, Newmont and Pan American Silver.\\u00a0\\nNSS Canada has spent the last two years developing MOSS AR and demonstrated the technology at the Mining Transformed exhibition, which took place from May 27-29, at the NORCAT Underground Centre in Sudbury. The company announced that it has moved into the pilot stage for MOSS AR and is currently looking for mining companies to test it at their underground operations.\\u00a0\\nKaitlynn Zygmont, sales and marketing director for NSS Canada, told CIM Magazine in an interview that the new technology provides real-time holographic projections of all survey and planned data, and significantly reduces the amount of equipment, and time, required to conduct surveying underground.\\u00a0\\nThe MOSS AR set-up includes a hard hat that is outfitted with Microsoft\\u2019s HoloLens 2, a tablet that connects to the HoloLens via Bluetooth, and two printed QR codes that utilize existing survey control points; this configuration replaces the total station, tripod and prisms that were previously required to get the job done. Zygmont said that MOSS AR can mark up the underground area in three to five minutes, compared to about 20 minutes using MOSS without AR.\\u00a0\\n\\u201cThis is something that allows the users to move faster underground,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIn addition to that, it eliminates your interaction with the face. Obviously, miners want to [limit] their interactions with the face as much as possible, because that\\u2019s where rockfalls happen, and there\\u2019s potential for injury. You\\u2019re able to stay three to five metres away from the face with MOSS AR. And you\\u2019re not needing to do any physical markup with the face at all anymore, because everything\\u2019s just done with hand gestures and with the augmented reality display.\\u201d\\u00a0\\nHow it works is the blasted face profile is captured by the HoloLens 2, creating a digital twin of the drift. The data is then exported in real time to the tablet, where the miner can calculate overbreak and design a blast pattern based on the captured face.\\u00a0\\n\\u201cAt that last step, you\\u2019re able to see the completed markup, and you\\u2019re ready to see all the drill hole patterns,\\u201d she said. \\u201cIt\\u2019s really cool to be able to see the visual of all those drill hole patterns of what the jumbo operator would see.\\u201d\\u00a0\\nZygmont described the technology, which she said is unique in the market, as the future of mining\\u2014something that could potentially become part of every miner\\u2019s surveying toolkit.\\u00a0\\nBen Rantala, senior technical support specialist for NSS Canada, told CIM Magazine in an interview that safety was the biggest consideration when designing the product: \\u201cMaking sure that the visuals would be good underground safety-wise, because the number one thing [underground] is safety. The visor is actually rated for underground and it\\u2019s CSA [Canadian Standards Association] approved, [so] we don\\u2019t have to wear our normal [safety] glasses underground when we have that on our head.\\u201d\\u00a0\\nZygmont added that another advantage of using AR underground is that unlike virtual reality, users do not lose a sense of their environment. \\u201cWhen you have the augmented reality, you\\u2019re underground, you\\u2019re able to see where you\\u2019re stepping, you\\u2019re able to see the face\\u2014all of your environment is in front of you, you just have something projected on top of that,\\u201d she said.\\u00a0\\nIn November 2023, NSS Canada signed a memorandum of understanding with equipment manufacturer Komatsu for the company to use and supply current versions of MOSS with its jumbo drills, and eventually MOSS AR.\\u00a0\\nIn the future, Zygmont said that the company plans to create a fully autonomous MOSS AR: \\u201cOur aim eventually is to have it so that when you\\u2019re underground drilling as a jumbo operator, that basically your drill hole patterns in your view are fully going to be integrated into your windshield with things like AI [artificial intelligence].\\u201d\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCritical minerals list updated\\n\\nKelsey Rolfe\\nMiners could gain access to tax credits, attract new trade partners\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCanada\\u2019s rising gold exports to China, oil sands evacuations due to wildfires, and Teck-Glencore coal sale closes\\n\\nAshley Fish-Robertson\\nThe CIM Magazine Weekly Mining News Recap for July 12\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPrint Edition\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                        Flip, scroll and swipe your way to the best mining stories and news anytime, anywhere.\\n                                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout Us\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout the magazine\\nContact us\\nAdvertise\\nMedia kit\\nInternship\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe to our list to stay connected\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEnglish\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                We have sent you a confirmation email\\n                            \\n\\n                                The Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) is an association for minerals industry professionals.

This article has covered observations made by analysts at IDC and Omdia on the recent developments in the XR industry.\\nDespite a projected stagnation in near-eye display shipments for 2024, the long-term outlook for the market remains positive, Kimi Lin said in a recent Omdia report.\\n\\u201cWith advancements in display, optical, and other component technologies, Omdia is optimistic about the long-term outlook. Near-eye display shipments are projected to grow rapidly from 2027, reaching 92.9 million units by 2030,\\u201d stated Kimi Lin, Senior Research Analyst at Omdia.\\nThe global display industry is set to convene at the Omdia Display Conference from September 12-13, 2024, in Shanghai, China. During the event, Kimi Lin and a team of Omdia analysts will present their research on the latest innovations within the display sector.\\nXR market\\nThe XR market, which includes AR, VR, and MR, is currently facing a downturn, causing significant layoffs at leading companies and prompting several smartphone brands to halt or scale back their XR projects. Despite these setbacks, industry leaders are determined to rejuvenate the market and drive growth in the coming years, Omdia said.\\nFor instance, Microsoft announced layoffs primarily targeting its mixed reality (MR unit, responsible for the HoloLens 2 AR headset.\\nTechnology major Google is cutting hundreds of jobs in its AR (Augmented Reality) hardware and voice assistant businesses, according to reports.\\nAnother tech giant Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs in 2023.\\nChina-based ByteDance-owned virtual reality (VR) headset maker Pico is conducting a new round of\\u00a0job cuts\\u00a0in line with a restructuring.\\nThe latest IDC report said global shipments of augmented reality and virtual reality (AR VR) headsets fell 67.4 percent in the first quarter of 2024 as the market is transitioning to include new categories such as Mixed Reality (MR) and Extended Reality (ER).\\n\\nThe average selling price (ASP) of AR and VR headsets rose to over $1000 as Apple entered the market and incumbents such as Meta focused on premium headsets such as the Quest 3.\\nVirtual Reality headsets are forecast to reach 24.7 million units by the end of 2028, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.2 percent as the consumer base slowly grows beyond core gaming use cases and as businesses adopt more headsets for training, design, and more.\\nAugmented Reality headsets will grow from a smaller base of less than a million units in 2024 to 10.9 million in 2028, representing an 87.1 percent CAGR over the same period, Jitesh Ubrani, research manager,\\u00a0Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers\\u00a0at IDC, said.\\nGrowth plans\\nMeta and PICO plan to launch the Quest 3S and PICO 4S in the second half of 2024, both at lower prices than their predecessors to stimulate sales. Meanwhile, Sony\\u2019s PlayStation VR2 (PS VR2) will now support PC VR games, expanding beyond its previous PS5 exclusivity, which is anticipated to boost PS VR2 sales, Omdia said.\\nIDC report on share of AR VR vendors Q1 2024\\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms has announced the initial release of its XR operating systems to third-party OEMs, including ASUS, Lenovo, and Microsoft Xbox. Meta will also focus on enhancing the quality and quantity of its platform and application software to improve hardware terminal sales.\\nIn 2024, the XR market\\u2019s primary focus will be on the Apple Vision Pro.

Peter hadn't started buying his supply of candy when he came across a Halloween display at Lowe's in Auburn,\\u00a0which made\\u00a0even him pause.

We\\u2019ve included events, inventions, and trends that changed the ways that Halloween was celebrated over time. Many of these traditions were phased out over time.

There also were more word mix-ups, which have become characteristic of Mr. Biden\\u2019s public addresses.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen it came time to answer a question about Vice President Kamala Harris possibly succeeding him on the ticket, he identified her as \\u201cVice President Trump.\\u201d\\nHe said, \\u201cI wouldn\\u2019t have picked her if she wasn\\u2019t qualified to be president.\\u201d\\nMr. Biden was criticized for his gaffes, including by former President Donald Trump, who blasted him on his social media site for mixing him up with Ms. Harris.\\nBiden aides praised his performance, which they said showcased his command of foreign affairs.\\n\\u201cTo answer the question on everyone\\u2019s minds: No, Joe Biden does not have a doctorate in foreign affairs,\\u201d White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates posted on X. \\u201cHe\\u2019s just that f\\u2014\\u2014\\u2014 good.\\u201d\\nThe press conference focused mostly on his fitness for the job and whether he should run for another term.\\nThe president said he would take a cognitive test, but only if his doctor ordered one, and denied needing to go to bed early despite reports that he told Democratic governors he needed to retire at 8 p.m.\\nHe explained that \\u201cit would be smarter to pace myself a little more\\u201d and not be on the job from early in the morning until very late at night.\\n\\u201cMy schedule has been full bore,\\u201d Mr. Biden added, taking a swipe at his opponent.\\n\\u201cWhere has Trump been? Riding around in his golf cart, filling out his scorecard before he hits the ball? I always have an inclination, just to keep going, not stopping. I\\u2019ve just got to pace myself a little more,\\u201d Mr. Biden said.\\nHe stumbled over questions about U.S. weapons being used by Ukraine to strike Russia, telling reporters, \\u201cour military is working on following the advice of my commander in chief, my, my chief of staff of the military, as well as the secretary of defense and our intelligence people\\u201d when it comes to U.S. involvement.\\nHe attempted to navigate a question about how he would handle the growing alliance between Russia and China, but part of it was rambling.\\nHe answered a follow-up question about whether he would be capable of negotiating face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin or Chinese President Xi Jinping in two or three years.\\n\\u201cI\\u2019m ready to deal with them now and three years from now. Like I said, I\\u2019m dealing with Xi right now, in direct contact with him. I have no good reason to talk to Putin right now. There isn\\u2019t any world leader I\\u2019m not prepared to deal with. I\\u2019m not ready to talk to Putin unless Putin is ready to change his behavior,\\u201d he said.\\nHe also highlighted his efforts to assist civilians in Gaza while Israel roots out Hamas militants who attacked their country on Oct. 7.\\nThe president took questions from the press in a bid to prove his cognitive mettle after a disastrous debate performance two weeks ago and amid increasing calls from within his own party for him to quit the race and hand the baton, presumably to Ms. Harris.\\nThe president arrived at the press conference after a bad stumble at NATO, right in front of world leaders gathered in Washington where he has worked this week to prove he is a capable leader.\\nAfter a day of talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Mr. Biden introduced him as \\u201cPresident Putin,\\u201d the Russian president who invaded his country.\\nMr. Biden immediately corrected and attempted to explain himself, but the gaffe exploded on social media and led the evening news, adding to Mr. Biden\\u2019s struggle to prove he is cognitively fit for office.\\nHe is facing rising pressure from Democrats to move aside for Ms. Harris or another Democratic candidate ahead of the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, which begins on Aug. 19.\\nSenate Democrats met with Biden staffers Thursday on Capitol Hill and left no more confident that Mr. Biden could pull off a win against Mr. Trump.\\n\\nA Washington Post/Ipsos poll released Thursday showed Mr. Biden and Mr. Trump tied nationally, which has largely been the case for months. But the same poll showed two-thirds of Americans believe Mr. Biden should not run for reelection, including three-quarters of critical independents and more than half of all Democrats.\\n\\n\\u2022 Susan Ferrechio can be reached at sferrechio@washingtontimes.com.\\n\\n\\n\\nCopyright \\u00a9 2024 The Washington Times, LLC. \\n                        \\n                          Click\\n                            here for reprint permission.\\n\\nPlease read\\n  our comment policy before commenting.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Click to Read More and View Comments\\n                    \\n Click to Hide \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFollow Us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSearch\\nSearch Keyword:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n        Search\\n      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Advertisement\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n      Advertisement\\n    \\n\\n\\n\\nFront Page Podcast\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCommentary\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCheryl K.

Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset (Apple calls it a \\u201cSpatial Computer\\u201d) that marries an M2 processor with a lot of custom silicon, sensors, cameras, and more. The starting price of $3,499 means that it\\u2019s a niche product, but it\\u2019s the first in a new category that Apple believes will be critical in the coming years.\\nUpdate July 12: Vision Pro is now available in the U.K., Canada, Australia France, and Germany.\\n\\nApple Vision Pro: Worldwide availability\\nAfter the U.S. launch in February 2024, Apple had said that the Vision Pro would be shipping to \\u201cmore countries\\u201d later in 2024. At WWDC Apple announced which countries and when: \\n\\nChina (mainland): June 28\\nHong Kong: June 28\\nJapan: June 28\\nSingapore: June 28\\nAustralia: July 12\\nCanada: July 12\\nFrance: July 12\\nGermany: July 12\\nU.K.: July 12\\n\\nVision Pro is now available to purchase in all of the above countries and the U.S. It\\u2019s unclear when or if Apple plans to launch the new headset in other countries beyond these.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro: Price and availability\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Read our review\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe headset was first announced at WWDC on June 5, 2023, with pre-orders starting January 19, 2024, and availability in the U.S. only on February 2. The starting price is $3,499 for 256GB of storage, with a 512GB model available for $3,699 and a 1TB model for $3,899. \\nNow that Apple has started to sell the Vision Pro outside the U.S. we have the price for those other territories:\\n\\n\\nChina: 29,999 yuan\\nHong Kong: HK$27,999\\nJapan: 599,800 yen\\nSingapore: S$5,299\\nAustralia: A$5,999 inc. GST\\nCanada: $4,999 (CAD)\\nFrance: \\u20ac3 999 \\nGermany: \\u20ac3.999\\nU.K.: \\u00a33,499\\n\\nYou can only buy a Vision Pro online directly from Apple\\u2019s website, by using the Apple Store app on your iPhone, or at an Apple Store. Part of the reason for this is the necessity to get a proper fit and optical insert if needed. Apple takes a scan of your face (you do this yourself with your iPhone if you are buying online) to select a proper face seal size. If you wear prescription eyewear or need readers, you can order special Zeiss inserts for $99/\\u00a399 (readers) or $149/\\u00a3149 (prescription). The headset is not designed to work with your existing eyewear.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\n\\nApple\\n\\n\\nApple\\nThere are also other accessories available for purchase, including a travel case ($199/\\u00a3199), battery ($199/\\u00a3199), Belkin Battery Holder ($50/\\u00a349.95), Solo knit Band ($99/\\u00a399), Dual Loop Band ($99/\\u00a399), Light Seal ($199/\\u00a3199), and Light Seal Cushion ($29/\\u00a325). AppleCare+ is also available for $499/\\u00a3499 for two years.\\n\\n\\nWill there be a cheaper Apple Vision Pro? \\nWe take the fact that the Vision Pro has the word \\u201cPro\\u201d in its name as a big hint that a more affordable version will be coming down the line. An \\u201cApple Vision Air,\\u201d if you will. \\nApple is thought to be working on two new Vision products: a refreshed high-end \\u201cPro\\u201d model with enhanced capabilities, and a more affordable model that Apple would aim to sell for a price similar to that of a high-end iPhone.\\n\\nNew rumors about the successor to Vision Pro \\u2013 both what it will be and when it will arrive \\u2013 change frequently. They all have one thing in common, though: there isn\\u2019t expected to be any new hardware in 2024. Bloomberg\\u2019s Mark Gurman believes that a cheaper headset will arrive in 2025. He reported in October 2023 that Apple is already working on the sequel to the headset, which will be cheaper than the original model.\\nIn June 2024 a report in The Information claimed that Apple had killed the development of the Vision Pro 2 in order to focus on a lower-cost headset for 2025. However, Apple is said to be struggling to bring down manufacturing costs without cutting back on features and performance too much.\\n\\n\\nThe Vision Pro is likely to follow the example of the HomePod with the expensive pro model paving the way for a cheaper option down the line. But it could be a while before the economies of scale and advancements in technology make a cheaper Apple Vision product viable.\\nApple Vision Pro: Compatibility \\nThe Vision Pro is its own product with its own software ecosystem. It has its own App Store, and runs software independent from other Apple products (though apps like Messages and Photos can sync via iCloud with your other Apple products).\\n\\nThere is support for iPad apps, however. By default, all iPad apps are made available for use on Vision Pro and can be found in the Vision Pro app store, but developers can opt not to allow their apps to be used on the device. White many iPad apps are available, prominent exceptions include YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix.\\nApple Vision Pro: Specs\\nThe Vision Pro is powered by an M2 processor with 8 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores\\u2013the same as you would find in a MacBook. It has 16GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of flash storage.\\n\\n\\nThere are 14 cameras on the inside and outside, a LiDAR scanner, multiple IR illuminators, an accelerometer, gyroscope, and multiple microphones. A custom R1 processor is made to process the vast amount of data from these sensors very quickly, for lightning-fast eye tracking and a delay for the video pass-through of only 12 milliseconds.\\nWhen wearing the Vision Pro you look through custom catadioptric pancake lenses at a pair of micro-OLED displays, one for each eye. About the size of a postage stamp, each of these displays has a stunning resolution of about 3,386 pixels per inch, more than 4K per eye. Of course, what matters is pixels per degree when looking through the lenses, which on Vision Pro is around 34 pixels per degree (less than you\\u2019d see looking at an iPhone display, but more than most other VR headsets).\\nApple does not disclose the field of view for the Vision Pro, but it appears to be somewhere around 110\\u00b0 horizontally and 90\\u00b0 vertically.\\nThe Vision Pro is actively cooled, with a fan inside, but the fan runs so quietly you can\\u2019t hear it.\\n\\n\\nThere are two individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod on the side of the headset near the headband connection. They deliver Personalized Spatial Audio based on the user\\u2019s own head and ear geometry. As a result, the sound feels like it is coming from the space around you. Vision Pro also matches the sound to the room using audio raytracing. \\nThe Vision Pro also recognizes the user\\u2019s iris via a new method to unlock the device and authenticate passwords and purchases called Optic ID. Like the iPhone and Mac, all data is stored on a dedicated Secure\\u00a0Enclave processor.  \\nOn the outside of the headset is an OLED display with a lenticular lens over it that Apple calls EyeSight. It projects a rendered image of your own eyes with correct perspective, so others can see you looking at them. If you are in a fully immersive environment and can\\u2019t see anyone, the EyeSight display shows a blueish haze.\\nBattery life \\nApple Vision Pro connects to an external battery via a custom tether, and the battery lasts for around 2 to 2.5 hours. The battery pack has a USB-C port that can only be used to recharge it, though you can use the Vision Pro with the battery plugged in.\\n\\n\\nWeight and dimensions\\nAccording to Apple Vision Pro tech specs, the headset weighs 21.2 to 22.9 ounces (600 to 650 grams) depending on the Light Seal and headband configuration. That\\u2019s about the weight of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (24 ounces/682\\u00a0grams). It\\u2019s not necessarily heavier than other VR headsets but quite a bit heavier than the Meta Quest 3, which weighs 18.2 ounces (516 grams).\\nThe weight is very front-heavy, mostly in the metal and glass out in the front of the face seal instead of distributed around the sides. The battery pack weighs 12.5 ounces (353 grams). \\nApple Vision Pro: Hands-on and overall experience\\nIn our Apple Vision Pro review, we found the technology very impressive, but the comfort and software\\u2014both apps and operating system\\u2014quite limited. There\\u2019s a lot of potential there, but it will take quite a while for the software to mature enough to unlock it, and for most users, the Vision Pro will never be worth the price. \\nWith a Vision Pro headset users will be able to watch a movie, listen to music, browse photos, look at 3D objects, and even collaborate on a presentation. \\n\\n\\nUsers experience a three-dimensional interface and input system that they control with their eyes, hands, and voice. You select things by looking at them and pinching your fingers together, then dragging objects around or flicking your hand to scroll. A virtual keyboard is used to enter text where appropriate, either by poking at the keys or looking at each key in succession and pinching your fingers together. You can also use voice input to enter text, or a Bluetooth keyboard.\\nApple has posted a 10-minute guided tour explaining how navigation and gestures work as well as several apps.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\n\\nApple\\n\\n\\nApple\\nWhen you first put on Vision Pro you see your surroundings. You can freely move apps to fill the space around you and they can expand into your space. The digital crown lets you adjust the volume or the degree of immersion in your environment\\u2013from fully immersed in a virtual space to seeing \\u201cpass-through\\u201d video of your own space. Here\\u2019s a primer on what the Vision Pro buttons do.\\nA user can bring a Mac wirelessly into the Apple Vision Pro space just by looking at it and choosing to connect to it if it is logged into the same Apple ID. The Mac display will blank out and be replaced by a big 4K virtual display in your Vision Pro environment; you\\u2019ll continue to use the Mac keyboard and touchpad, however, and audio will still play from the Mac.\\n\\n\\nApple Vision Pro: Software and apps\\nThe Vision Pro headset runs visionOS, an operating system that Apple has designed from the ground up for visual computing. Apple launched a number of native Vision Pro versions of its apps at launch, such as Safari, Messages, and FaceTime. Apple launched Vision Pro with more than 600 optimized apps. The latest version is visionOS 1.1, which includes support for managed profiles, improved Personas, and lots of bug fixes and minor improvements.\\nIn fall 2024, Apple will release visionOS 2, the first major update to the OS. It will bring numerous refinements and upgrades, including the ability to transform regular, 2D photos into spatial photos, and wide and ultra-wide screen views with Mac Virtual Display.\\nApple Vision Pro: Glossary and terminology\\nAs with many Apple products, the company has some of its own branding around things that may be better understood by other names. Here are some of the things you may see associated with Vision Pro and what they mean.\\nSpatial Computing: Computing that appears to happen in the environment around you rather than inside a computer (or phone). A sort of umbrella term that encapsulates AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality), and MR (Mixed Reality). It is not inaccurate to call Vision Pro a mixed-reality headset.\\n\\n\\nSpatial apps: Apps designed with the Vision Pro hardware in mind, as opposed to iPad apps running in a window. Some Spatial apps are fully immersive experiences, others are almost indistinguishable from iPad apps.\\nFully immersive: A \\u201cfully immersive\\u201d experience is one in which your surroundings are not visible: you\\u2019re completely surrounded in a virtual environment. In other words Virtual Reality.\\nSpatial Audio: Audio that seems to come from specific places in your environment. \\nPersona: A 3D digital recreation of you, created by scanning your face using the Vision Pro cameras. It is meant to be used to represent you in video conferencing apps like FaceTime or Zoom since the Vision Pro has no cameras that can actually see your face (just specialized internal cameras for eye tracking).\\n\\n\\nSpatial Video: A new 3D video format that can be captured with either the Vision Pro or an iPhone 15 Pro.

Exhilarated Republicans made a display of this in Milwaukee, where the party formally chose Donald Trump as its presidential nominee. The attack on July 13th has also affected Democrats, who have been in turmoil since President Joe Biden\\u2019s catastrophic debate performance last month. It disrupted the effort within the party to replace Mr Biden as its nominee. After the shooting, the atmosphere of shock made it untenable for Democratic rebels in Congress to advance their attempt to challenge Mr Biden\\u2019s candidacy. For a few days, no new House member or senator publicly called on the president to step aside.Explore moreUnited StatesElectionsJoe BidenDonald TrumpThis article appeared in the United States section of the print edition under the headline \\u201cDem dilemmas\\u201dShareReuse this contentMore from United StatesWhy MAGA is the future, not just present, of the GOPThe selection of J.D.

Overnight, topics relating to race, gender, and the legacies of racism and sexism became fraught within school districts throughout the country. Teachers who covered these grounds in their classrooms questioned if and when they might be called to an administrative office and told their services were no longer needed.\\nThe presiding judge, Paul Barbadoro, noted in\\u00a0his decision that the New Hampshire law \\u201cforce[s] teachers to guess as to which diversity efforts can be touted and which must be repudiated, gambling with their careers in the process.\\u201d\\nThis resulted both in self-censorship and the enforcement by school districts of precautionary censorship to avoid legal jeopardy.\\nBooks were taken off classroom shelves out of fear of violating the law. The New Hampshire Department of Education created a\\u00a0portal for reporting teachers who dared to speak up for honest, fact-based histories. A bounty was issued with a $500 reward for the first person to report a teacher.\\nDespite the obstacles, many teachers taught the truth and spoke out to news media, in writing, and through informal groups. These teachers did not conform under the immense pressure of the law. Others simply left the profession\\u2014a protest in itself.\\nAs similar laws spread across the country, teachers partnered with the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center to challenge the constitutionality of such measures. In Rhode Island, a law was defeated in committee, and in Arizona, it was struck down by the State Supreme Court. In Georgia, on the other hand, a law has been fully enacted, and one educator was fired for reading the children\\u2019s book My Shadow Is Purple to her class.\\nAssessing the varied legal strategies, Professor Derek Black of the University of South Carolina stated in 2023 that he believed the arguments addressing the chilling effect of the laws on teachers\\u2019 free speech presented the strongest cases for combatting \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d laws.\\nBlack\\u2019s analysis was prescient in New Hampshire, where Thurgood Marshall\\u2019s dissent in\\u00a0Arnett v. Kennedy held sway. Marshall had written in 1974, \\u201cFor every employee who risks his job by testing the limits of the statute, many more will choose the cautious path and not speak at all.\\u201d In the \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d case, the judge concluded that the vaguely worded statute provided no clear guideline for determining what kind of educational efforts were allowed or prohibited, leaving district administrators to err on the side of an overly broad application of the law, not knowing when an accusation of a violation might surface. All of this adds tremendous strain on our profession and public schools, arguably the central institutions of our communities.\\nThe ruling could bode well for Oklahoma, where the primary argument for striking down \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d was based on the vagueness of the law. Yet the positive outcome in New Hampshire comes with a warning: There\\u2019s still a possibility that the legislature could address the issue of vagueness with more direct language aimed at limiting speech on topics related to race and gender.\\nLike other states that have passed corrosive laws targeting public schools, New Hampshire must now decide the kind of civic culture we want to have today and for the next generation.\\nOur small state has long received outsized attention due to hosting the first primary election in the nation. As such, New Hampshire takes its role in the process of picking a President seriously. From the tiny hamlet of Dixville Notch down to Manchester and many small towns in between, there is a sense of civic pride in asking candidates tough questions. There is also a strong sense of pride in each of our local public schools\\u2014a trust in the professionalism and experience of our neighbors who teach.\\nThe ban on books and teaching honest history was anathema to the civic culture of New Hampshire. Or at least it put a dent in what many of us saw as our down-to-earth civic sensibility. We understood Florida, Texas, and Oklahoma had similar bills. But could it be that the politically purple Granite State could have such censorship? The answer was clear: It could and did happen here. And it would have continued to happen here had it not been for a federal judge.\\nAll of this is noteworthy in determining whether New Hampshire becomes a bellwether in the campaign for reaffirming a national commitment to a democratic, pluralistic civil society. We have seen laws that attempt to limit teaching and learning\\u2014a departure from the principle of the classroom being a \\u201cmarketplace of ideas.\\u201d We have also seen the shortcomings of past curricula that left important stories untold. This brings us to a moment where we all have a collective choice: recommit to the project or backslide on affirming the promise of a more perfect union.\\nThe long awaited win in federal court provides hope for educators. That hope is most palpably felt in my home state of New Hampshire, but educators across the United States should take it to heart. It is the hard work of educators who choose to teach the truth and to speak up for what\\u2019s right that creates the foundation of civic life and the potential for civic renewal. But the promise of liberty and justice for all takes all of us working together\\u2014victory over \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d legislation is a chance to improve how we do democracy and support learning for each and every student. We cannot afford to waste this opportunity.\\n\\nJacob Goodwin is a sixth grade social studies teacher and the 2021 New Hampshire History Teacher of the Year.\\n\\n\\nMonthly Review does not necessarily adhere to all of the views conveyed in articles republished at MR Online.

The bear was the creation of plant and flower nursery, E. Smith and Son, based in Lymm in Cheshire, and appeared in the BBC North West Tonight garden in 2003.But since late founder, Edwin Smith, created it the frame for the Children In Need mascot display had been left to the elements behind a shed. His son, Derek Smith, has got Pudsey in shape and it is ready to feature again this year. The late Edwin Smith pictured with his creation back in 2003Edwin died in 2018, but his son said he would have been \\\"absolutely made up\\\" to see his creation back in Tatton. Mr Smith told the BBC: \\\"We have kept him all these years never knowing that we would ever use him again. \\\"But it's really fantastic to get him out and get him replanted.\\\"He said Pudsey's metal frame had been \\\"hiding behind the shed\\\" for the past two decades and had not been \\\"well-looked after\\\". However, Mr Smith said it was still in good shape which was \\\"testament to the work of my father\\\". How the re-constructed plant-based Pudsey looks nowAfter a call from a BBC producer about five weeks ago, he said his enthusiasm was \\\"re-fired\\\" and the beloved bear was rescued and re-planted. Despite the challenges of such a short time-frame, the bear is now in fine shape thanks to Mr Smith's staff, including his daughter, Rachel. Rachel, who tried her best to help as a toddler in 2003, said her grandad \\\"would have been thrilled\\\" to see the bear back on display. Mr Smith said his father did \\\"lots of fantastic things\\\" for the Tatton show over the years. \\\"His legacy lives on in Pudsey,\\\" he added.

This article has covered observations made by analysts at IDC and Omdia on the recent developments in the XR industry.\\nDespite a projected stagnation in near-eye display shipments for 2024, the long-term outlook for the market remains positive, Kimi Lin said in a recent Omdia report.\\n\\u201cWith advancements in display, optical, and other component technologies, Omdia is optimistic about the long-term outlook. Near-eye display shipments are projected to grow rapidly from 2027, reaching 92.9 million units by 2030,\\u201d stated Kimi Lin, Senior Research Analyst at Omdia.\\nThe global display industry is set to convene at the Omdia Display Conference from September 12-13, 2024, in Shanghai, China. During the event, Kimi Lin and a team of Omdia analysts will present their research on the latest innovations within the display sector.\\nXR market\\nThe XR market, which includes AR, VR, and MR, is currently facing a downturn, causing significant layoffs at leading companies and prompting several smartphone brands to halt or scale back their XR projects. Despite these setbacks, industry leaders are determined to rejuvenate the market and drive growth in the coming years, Omdia said.\\nFor instance, Microsoft announced layoffs primarily targeting its mixed reality (MR unit, responsible for the HoloLens 2 AR headset.\\nTechnology major Google is cutting hundreds of jobs in its AR (Augmented Reality) hardware and voice assistant businesses, according to reports.\\nAnother tech giant Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs in 2023.\\nChina-based ByteDance-owned virtual reality (VR) headset maker Pico is conducting a new round of\\u00a0job cuts\\u00a0in line with a restructuring.\\nThe latest IDC report said global shipments of augmented reality and virtual reality (AR VR) headsets fell 67.4 percent in the first quarter of 2024 as the market is transitioning to include new categories such as Mixed Reality (MR) and Extended Reality (ER).\\n\\nThe average selling price (ASP) of AR and VR headsets rose to over $1000 as Apple entered the market and incumbents such as Meta focused on premium headsets such as the Quest 3.\\nVirtual Reality headsets are forecast to reach 24.7 million units by the end of 2028, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.2 percent as the consumer base slowly grows beyond core gaming use cases and as businesses adopt more headsets for training, design, and more.\\nAugmented Reality headsets will grow from a smaller base of less than a million units in 2024 to 10.9 million in 2028, representing an 87.1 percent CAGR over the same period, Jitesh Ubrani, research manager,\\u00a0Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers\\u00a0at IDC, said.\\nGrowth plans\\nMeta and PICO plan to launch the Quest 3S and PICO 4S in the second half of 2024, both at lower prices than their predecessors to stimulate sales. Meanwhile, Sony\\u2019s PlayStation VR2 (PS VR2) will now support PC VR games, expanding beyond its previous PS5 exclusivity, which is anticipated to boost PS VR2 sales, Omdia said.\\nIDC report on share of AR VR vendors Q1 2024\\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms has announced the initial release of its XR operating systems to third-party OEMs, including ASUS, Lenovo, and Microsoft Xbox. Meta will also focus on enhancing the quality and quantity of its platform and application software to improve hardware terminal sales.\\nIn 2024, the XR market\\u2019s primary focus will be on the Apple Vision Pro. Its high price is expected to limit its sales, preventing it from significantly boosting overall market growth.\\nOmdia predicts that total XR set shipments in 2024 will remain steady compared to 2023, with near-eye display shipments also flat at 17.2 million units. Nonetheless, the Vision Pro has significantly increased the share of OLED on silicon (OLEDoS) displays.\\nThe XR industry is expected to remain stagnant for the next one to two years. While set shipments will experience slight fluctuations, near-eye display shipments are projected to increase more significantly due to the inevitable shift from single to dual displays.\\nBaburajan Kizhakedath\\nTweetShareSharePin\\n\\nPrevious articleEricsson posts 7% drop in sales to $5.7 bn in second-quarterNext articleTPG Telecom and Optus network sharing deal faces review in Australia\\n\\n\\nLatest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTelenor reveals 3% growth in revenue in Q2 after price hike\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTSMC boosts revenue and Capex forecast amid AI chip demand surge\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSamsung dropped to third in India smartphone market\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nNokia Q2 2024 sales indicate significant drop in telecom Capex\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSamsung Researcher HyoungJin Choi named Chair of ITU-R Coordination Group on 6G\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMore like thisRelated\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSamsung dropped to third in India smartphone market\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 18, 2024 \\n\\nThe latest Canalys research report has revealed two interesting...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nUK regulators probe Big Tech\\u2019s growing influence in digital payment\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 16, 2024 \\n\\nBritish regulators are investigating the increasing use of digital...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nApple sale in India reaches $8 bn in 2023-24 fiscal\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 15, 2024 \\n\\nApple has generated sales of almost $8 billion in...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSmartphone market growth and leading vendors in second-quarter\\n\\n\\n Telecom Lead -  July 15, 2024 \\n\\nIDC and Canalys have shared the growth trends in...\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\nABOUT US\\nPARTNERSHIP\\nPRIVACY POLICY\\nCONTACT US\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAbout us\\n\\nNews website for 4G, 5G, Statistics, Telecom Services, Internet, Broadband, Broadcast, Network, Chips, and Smartphones.\\n\\n\\nFacebookLinkedinTwitter\\n\\nCompany\\n\\nABOUT US\\nPARTNERSHIP\\nPRIVACY POLICY\\nCONTACT US\\n\\n\\nThe latest\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTelenor reveals 3% growth in revenue in Q2 after price hike\\n\\n4G LTE\\n\\nJuly 18, 2024 0 \\n\\nTelenor has announced notable achievements in terms of revenue...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nTSMC boosts revenue and Capex forecast amid AI chip demand surge\\n\\nSemiconductor\\n\\nJuly 18, 2024 0 \\n\\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world\\u2019s largest contract...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nSamsung dropped to third in India smartphone market\\n\\nSmartphone\\n\\nJuly 18, 2024 0 \\n\\nThe latest Canalys research report has revealed two interesting...\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\u00a9 2024 Kizhakedath Media Services.

Not only that, each of the 50 YouTubers received a retro gaming handheld to call their own.\\nThe discovery was made on r/SBCGaming, where a screenshot of LilyPichu\\u2019s vlog of her experience being in the MrBeast competition surfaced. Each participant was given a goody bag, which features custom AirPods, and something a little more unusual: An Anbernic RG353V handheld.Article continues after adArticle continues after ad\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Anbernic RG353V isn\\u2019t one of the priciest retro handhelds out there. In fact, the device with its 3.4-inch IPS display, and up to 2GB LPDDDR4 of RAM (depending on the version) has an MRSP of $120.99. \\nEven with all 50 YouTubers each receiving their own, that\\u2019s still just over $6000 USD of handhelds alone.\\nWhile the Anbernic RG353V is not the most expensive, or even the most high-powered retro handheld out there, MrBeast\\u2019s choice to give it away makes sense. The YouTuber has cited his love of the Nintendo Game Boy repeatedly in the past, even going so far as to commission a custom Game Boy from The Retro Future years ago.Related:MrBeast reveals insane ad revenue earned from Twitter/X videoArticle continues after ad\\nAlthough the RG353V is not an official Nintendo handheld, it takes after the Game Boy in multiple ways. Its form factor is highly reminiscent of that of the DMG model Game Boy but with some added extras. Article continues after ad\\nInstead of just a D-pad and two-button layout, the RG353V features a left stick, a full ABXY button layout, and built-in WiFi. \\nDepending on the version MrBeast gave away, the retro handheld also has a touch-screen to use alongside Android-based games, a microSD card slot, and a 3200mAH rechargeable battery. Maybe some of these creators will fall in love with the emerging retro handheld emulator scene.Article continues after ad\\nkeep readingYouTubeMrBeast breaks his own record for day-one viewership with latest videoDaniel ApplefordYouTubeEvery creator in MrBeast\\u2019s $1 million YouTuber challenge & how they got eliminatedCarver FisherYouTubeMrBeast reveals video idea he wasn\\u2019t allowed to makeAlice Sj\\u00f6bergEntertainmentHow to apply for MrBeast\\u2019s $5 million Beast Games competitionMeera JackaYouTubeMrBeast urges billionaires to put their \\u201cunfathomable wealth\\u201d into YouTube contentMichael GwilliamYouTubeMrBeast reveals how much money he\\u2019s made reposting old YouTube videos to XMeera JackaYouTubeMrBeast\\u2019s Beast Games: Prize, where to watch & moreShay RobsonEntertainmentCreators furious as MrBeast nets $250K on Twitter/X for posting old videoVirginia GlazeRelated TopicsHandheldslilypichuMrbeastAbout The AuthorRosalie NewcombeDexerto's Senior Tech Writer.

We are all behind Gareth now. Like a vessel stuck in the Mersey, Southgate took an age to turn this England ship around. But nothing is won yet.This is no time to revert to caution. A fearless Spain await on Sunday, an opponent that would love nothing more than two banks of four to pick apart with their dashing wingers. The torpor of the group stage is mercifully behind us. Southgate finally arrived at a system that gets the best of his talented group, none more so than Phil Foden, who for the first time in the tournament looked like Phil Foden.Perhaps Southgate used as energy the heavy criticism that fell upon England\\u2019s remote enclave in Blankenhain. Castle walls that have held for 900 years were powerless to keep out the censure and opprobrium of fans and media, who did not like what they were seeing. When Gary Lineker hits the fan, you know you are in trouble.However, the leap was made from back-four to back-three. The template is set. Spain, powered by twin turbos left and right, Nico Williams Jr and the remarkable Lamine Yamal, for two days yet still only 16, fancy themselves to beat anybody. But England, having found the keys to adventure, have their weapons too.Read NextDaniel StoreyGareth Southgate's methods were utterly vindicated on his greatest nightRead MoreGetting to this point triggered a vehement philosophical debate around an England team led by a coach anchored to a pragmatic world view. Despite his understandable unease at criticism that became personal, Southgate has his defenders. They point to his record in major tournaments; nine wins in the knockout stages of major tournaments to date, three more than all the managers combined between 1968 and 2016 when he took over.The final in Berlin is England\\u2019s first on foreign soil. This is clearly worthy of praise, yet, should England fail on Sunday, Southgate will have left England where he found them, with only one major trophy in the cabinet. If, as the argument goes, it\\u2019s all about winning, then, however harsh it sounds and however good it felt on Wednesday, it amounts to nil money in the bank.The opening half an hour against Serbia and the Dutch display apart, Southgate has presided over an awful tournament. This followed a period of uninspiring displays this year in which they lost to Brazil and Iceland and drew against Belgium, all at home. The sense that opportunity was draining away felt entirely valid. The frustration of watching arguably England\\u2019s most talented group since 1966 trapped in and endless loop of sideways and backwards movement, was too much for right-thinking folk to bear. Even Lineker reached for the shit bomb.Southgate\\u2019s greatest achievement had been to make England fun again for the players and the fans. The sense of optimism was spawned by the march to the semi-finals in Russia six years ago, followed by the narrow defeat on penalties at the last Euros final, and latterly the quarter-final defeat to France at the World Cup in Qatar, which was arguably Southgate\\u2019s highwater mark since England were marginally the better team in a thrilling contest.But all that momentum seemed to have been lost in Germany, where Southgate was slow to accept there was any kind of problem. He steadfastly stuck to his players and formations when it was clear change was required. \\u201cYour best players are your best players,\\u201d was his mantra. Yes, but they were nowhere near playing at their best.Southgate retreated behind a siege mentality. He spoke of the disturbing and disruptive \\u201cnoise\\u201d about the camp, and saw the problem not as one of his making, but the inability of observers to see what he could see. This is inevitable when the rhythm and mood of an enclosed environment is designed to keep prying eyes from looking in. Yet he could not ignore the denunciation of former players and pundits, who filled the ether with their condemnations.Read NextFootballSport AnalysisEngland vs Netherlands player ratings as Bellingham poor but Watkins the heroRead MoreSouthgate claimed his phone was off for the duration. Clearly the message got through and with it the truth, finally accepted by him, that performances were not good enough and something had to change. The fear is that, given his innate conservativism, Southgate reverts to caution in the face of the Spanish threat.Yes Spain are good, not least because they believe themselves to be so. There is no inhibition in the group. No self-doubt. The formation is set around a central axis of Rodri, Fabian Ruiz and Dani Olmo, supported by the flying wingers outside. France, led by a coach in Didier Deschamps who is even more cautious than Southgate, sought to contain and hit on the counter.France scored first then sat back, which invited the inevitable response. Spain were rampant for an hour, but they themselves slowed in the second half when France took the brakes off. That final 20 minutes points the way for England. Spain did not look so peachy with Bradley Barcola running at them.For Barcola read Cole Palmer. England have the tools to take down any team, including Spain, but they can\\u2019t do that by being passive. They have to go at Spain like they did the Netherlands, who could not live with them in the opening 45 minutes, with Foden and Kobbie Mainoo controlling the match.Palmer proved the key to victory with his incisive pass to Ollie Watkins. The goal came in the nick of time. Both Palmer and Watkins should have been on earlier. They might need to be on Sunday. For Southgate, history beckons. And who knows, perhaps an audience with the King. Arise Sir Gareth, anyone?

It has, he opined, got a bad rap, deservedly so. \\n\\n\\u201cUndoubtedly, the strict measures implemented by the NRA have had unparalleled success in combating corruption in the past, earning the respect and trust of the masses. We, however, have been let down primarily by a few individuals responsible for financial matters, procurement, and the distribution of supplies and equipment,\\u201d Mr Museveni offered, adding, \\u201cThe problem worsened when political leaders, particularly MPs, started paying themselves excessively, which diverted them from their primary responsibility of safeguarding the interests of the people they represent. We are now coming in directly to restore the NRA heritage. The young people, with their passion-driven outlook, and the victims of corruption have a chance to lead this effort.\\u201d \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Museveni gestures during the opening ceremony of a\\u00a0cabinet introspection\\u00a0at the National Leadership Institute in Kyankwanzi District on July 8, 2024. PHOTO/HANDOUT/PPU\\n\\n \\n\\nCaught in the shiver of excitement after watching what the youth in Kenya have been able to achieve, it remains to be seen what the yields of the \\u201cpassion-driven outlook\\u201d of Uganda\\u2019s young people will look like. Chatter about a march to Parliament on July 23 in protest against fraudulent conduct by those in power keeps gaining in amplitude.\\u00a0 \\n\\nEmpirical evidence shows that, globally, no demographic cohort has seen more wind taken out of its sails by the cost-of-living crisis as the Zoomers or Generation Z. Born anywhere from 1997 to 2012, Zoomers have seen most, if not all, of their dreams and hopes take root in barren soil. \\n\\nLargely written off as passive, a violent inner rage has flared in a great deal of them recently. And not just in Kenya. Zoomers in Uganda demonstrated an underlying outrage on online spaces when Speaker Anita Among claimed that funds pilfered by government bureaucrats eventually trickle down to your average ordinary person.\\u00a0 \\n\\nThe Speaker of Parliament made the comments\\u2014a stunning moral recalibration\\u2014at the backend of June during the launch of the Ssentaayi Development Foundation in Lwengo, whose District Woman Representative in Parliament Cissy Namujju, is incarcerated. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nParliament Speaker Anita Among and President Museveni's younger brother\\u00a0Michael Nuwagira Kaguta aka\\u00a0Toyota attend an event organized by MP\\u00a0Muhammad\\u00a0Muyanja\\u00a0Ssentaayi in Lwengo District on June 22, 2024. PHOTO/GERTRUDE MUTYABA\\u00a0\\n\\n \\n\\nMs Namujju and two other lawmakers\\u2014Yusuf Mutembeli (Bunyole East), and Paul Akamba (Busiki County)\\u2014stand accused of trying to extract a kickback from the Uganda Human Rights Commission during the budgeting process for the Fiscal Year (FY) 2024/2025. \\n\\nFall from grace\\u00a0Only recently, President Museveni, apoplectic with rage, refused to sign the Appropriations Bill until more than Shs700 billion, which had been reallocated by lawmakers in this year\\u2019s financial budget, was reinstated. Before, the President joined many Ugandans in questioning the wisdom of expending north of Shs1 billion on a so-called service award for four backbench parliamentary commissioners.\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\u201cI could have blocked the moves by the MPs to award themselves high salaries. I opposed [it] but did not block because it is not always correct to block everything you consider a mistake. It is better, sometimes, to oppose but also allow people to learn from their mistakes or for the issue at hand to be clearer,\\u201d Mr Museveni said at the recent Cabinet retreat in Kyankwanzi.\\u00a0 \\n\\nThe embarrassment of riches of Ugandan lawmakers continues to be greeted with horror and dismay by not just the impoverished country\\u2019s President but also the citizenry. The laundry list of perks the lawmakers receive includes a one-off vehicle allowance of Shs150m; a net salary of Shs6.1m; a housing allowance of Shs6.5m; a constituency support fee of Shs17.03m; as well as a town running fee of Shs1.945m. They also receive a fuel allowance of anywhere between Shs10.3m and Shs31m, as well as a free iPad and a Shs50,000 allowance for attending committee sessions, among others. \\n\\nMUST READ:\\u00a0Luxury cars for leaders: Necessity or profligacy? \\n\\nCamels will pass through eyes of needles before Museveni fights corruption \\n\\nReviewing President Museveni\\u2019s \\u201cWhat is Africa\\u2019s problem?\\\" \\n\\nWhat if Museveni uses anti-corruption card? \\n\\nYet, with barely a year left towards the end of its term, the desecrated Eleventh Parliament is serving as a cautionary tale after its lawmakers became agents of quid-pro-quo deals with senior government officials to feather their nests. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMinisters and other government officials attend their retreat at the National Leadership Institute in Kyankwanzi District on July 8, 2024. PHOTO/PPU\\n\\n \\n\\nHow did Uganda\\u2019s Parliament, which in the past was a respected citadel against Executive overreach, turn into the poster child of graft? Mr Moses Khisa, an associate professor of Political Science at NC State University, USA, believes the buck stops with President Museveni. \\n\\n\\u201cAs Museveni\\u2019s regime has become rusty, the extent of transactional politics has become brazen. It\\u2019s an accumulation of decay, dysfunction and decline. Parliament is the centre of national politics. It\\u2019s where elite accommodation and compromises take place, it\\u2019s where quid-pro-quo is marshalled, and Museveni has always understood this very well, that\\u2019s why he ensures that the NRM maintains a super-majority,\\u201d he told Monitor. \\n\\nIts genesisThis creeping hand of graft orchestrated by an intricately woven government syndicate began to seep across the hallowed grounds of the Seventh Parliament. The vice has not spared the Opposition, whose lawmakers chair oversight committees, including the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), the Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises (Cosase), and the Local Government Accountability Committee, among others. \\n\\nMany of these accountability committees created the perfect storm for graft as government officials implicated in corruption scandals used part of their stolen loot to bribe lawmakers tasked with an oversight role at the committee level. In turn, the lawmakers, including those in the Opposition used this smokescreen to pander to the gallery. This is because they used their powers to intimidate government officials implicated in graft reports to seek higher thresholds.\\u00a0 \\n\\nHow did Parliament, whose lawmakers during the National Resistance Council (NRC), the first Parliament of the National Resistance Movement government, drove Stout pick-up trucks as their official vehicles and only earned allowances\\u2014turn its hallowed grounds into an ostentatious display of nouveau-riche symbols? \\n\\nMr Gerald Karuhanga, who served as the Ntungamo Municipality MP in the Ninth and Tenth Parliament, said he witnessed the \\u2018ingenuity\\u2019 that sustained corruption at Parliament.\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\u201cI was in the Public Accounts Committee and saw many ugly cases. Something told me that much of the rot is in the Budget Committee where heavily syndicated cartels I saw with my naked eyes operate,\\u201d he disclosed, adding, \\u201cThe Budget Committee cleared the budgets of all the other committees, and it was so powerful that you could read between the lines that almost anything the Budget Committee chairperson pursued, could go through. For instance, a budget for a specific ministry could be passed in totality.\\u201d \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFormer MP Gerald Karuhanga.\\u00a0\\n\\n \\n\\nMr Karuhanga said the less-aggressive ministries would receive 70 percent of their budgets and this habit was largely perpetrated by heads of agencies and departments from \\u2018western Uganda.\\u2019 The lawmaker raised this matter on the floor of Parliament and personally pursued public interest litigation against graft. \\n\\n\\u201cThe chairperson of the Budget Committee could pursue this personally with promises after the Permanent Secretary of a ministry conducted a secret meeting with the chairperson. I reported these incidents of collusion, and it is on the record of the Hansard, but no action was taken, that is how some ministries, state agencies and parastatals received 100 percent of their budgets,\\u201d he told Saturday Monitor.\\u00a0 \\n\\nUnderhanded practicesMr Karuhanga notes that there were various methods of receiving bribes and some of the cunning MPs physically received cash from those who wanted to conceal their dirty deals. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u201cIt was never one approach to receiving bribes. There was ingenuity when receiving this money. On one occasion, some unknown men showed up at Parliament in my office over the Lubowa incident and tried to offer me money, which I rejected,\\u201d he reveals, adding, \\u201cThey were emissaries and I threatened them that they could be arrested. They apologised and told me they were shocked that I rejected the bribe money. I did not call the police because I believed that these men accessed Parliament through the connivance of the House security.\\u201d \\n\\nThe former Ntungamo Municipality lawmaker said it was usually during report writing when the cunning nature of MPs who had been compromised reared its ugly head.\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\u201cThe report was a stark contrast of what had been unearthed during the probe, and this was so shocking,\\u201d he discloses. \\n\\nREAD: How Canadian investors were conned by Ugandans at Parliament \\n\\nInvestors bribe State House officials to meet me - Museveni \\n\\nAmong, Magogo, Lugoloobi among eight Ugandan officials sanctioned by US \\n\\nTrips outside the country where MPs earn large amounts in allowances, have also been used to reward and punish allies in Parliament. Mr Karuhanga said this practice began during the Ninth Parliament, where the Speaker made the final decision on who could travel. \\u00a0 \\n\\nIn April 2020, Karuhanga triumphantly walked out of the Constitutional Court after suing his colleagues for a dubious payment of Shs10 billion, which was slashed from a Shs304 billion supplementary Covid-19 budget to their accounts. Each MP had received Shs20m for sensitisation campaigns in their constituencies. However, in a consent judgment by the Constitutional Court, they were ordered to refund the funds.\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\u201cWhen I tried to raise it on the floor, some MPs threatened to assault me. A few MPs protected me. What encouraged me to challenge it in court was not just that isolated case,\\u201d he said, adding, \\u201cSadly I noted that Parliament had turned into a deals workshop and was so overt in its corrupt practice.\\u201d \\n\\nMr Karuhanga posits that \\u201cthis consistent pattern has bred a culture of self-aggrandizement.\\u00a0\\u201cFor instance, the Covid-19 budget incident was so shocking when the chairperson, [Amos] Lugoolobi read that there was a gift for MPs when it had not been discussed at the Committee, which I was part of, then all of a sudden, a take-home of Shs20m was introduced,\\u201d he notes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nState minister for Planning Amos Lugoloobi (centre) at the Anti-Corruption Court in Kampala on April 17, 2023. PHOTO/ ABUBAKER LUBOWA\\n\\n \\n\\nMr Lugoolobi was subsequently appointed a junior Finance minister. In August 2023, High Court Judge, Margaret Tibulya, charged Mr Lugoolobi for contravening sections of the Anti-Corruption Act for the offence of diverting iron sheets meant for the vulnerable people of Karamoja Sub-region.\\u00a0 \\n\\nA den of thieves?Mr Karuhanga said he was shocked when these syndicates scaled what he thought was a robust Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS). One of the major graft incidents, he recalls, was captured in the Auditor General\\u2019s report for the FY 2014/2015. \\n\\nThe report raised accountability queries in the Local Government ministry. Mr Patrick Mutabwire, the acting Permanent Secretary then, was accused of diverting Shs12 billion meant to procure 111 vehicles for district chairpersons in the country. \\n\\nOnly Shs1.5 billion was spent. The rest was diverted to the Local Government ministry\\u2019s recurrent expenditure and doled out as staff field allowance. Mr Karuhanga said the PAC probed this matter and unearthed rot at the heart of the diversion. \\n\\n\\u201cCommercial banks have CCTV that show how these syndicates work. About four staff members were interrogated from 10 am till midnight [by PAC lawmakers] and told us that they would pick up the money almost every week from the bank and hand it over to the accounting officer in tranches of Shs100m. We were surprised that some staff had field allowance days of 1,200 each, others 900 days and 800 days each in one calendar year, which has 365 days,\\u201d he recalled.\\u00a0 \\n\\nSupreme Court Justice Irene Mulyagonja, who was the ombudsman at the time, on October 27, 2015, wrote to the Head of Public Service then, Mr John Mitala, and ordered the interdiction of Mutabwire on corruption allegations. Save for being replaced with John Walala, nothing became of Mr Mutabwire.\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJustice Irene Mulyagonja. PHOTO/FILE\\n\\n \\n\\nMr Karuhanga also recalled questioning a suspected budget allocation of Shs26 billion where Shs16 billion was doled out to the human resource empowerment vote and another Shs10 billion was for capacity building at the Finance ministry. All of this was presented in a 300-voluminous report.\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\u201cIf you were in a rush, you would miss these figures. I asked what is the difference between these two items was and the Finance ministry dropped the Shs16 billion vote. Capacity building and human resource development are quite good votes because the hotels usually get business and quickly provide accountability through invoices,\\u201d Mr Karuhanga reveals. \\n\\n\\u201cCorruption in Uganda is like the bloodline of the ruling party. It has permeated every sector, all the ministries, departments, and agencies and sadly most of the population. When the Speaker changes, the workers at Parliament look at it from an ethnic lens,\\u201d Mr Karuhanga argues, mimicking the words of British author, Michela Wrong, who authored the book titled It is Our Turn to Eat: The Story of a Kenyan Whistle-blower, which is an eye-opening account of tribal rivalries, pervasive graft, and the rising anger of a prospect-less youth in Kenya.\\u00a0 \\n\\nTo which Khisa concurs, noting thus: \\u201cOn Parliament and deals, I think the current state speaks perfectly to what Nelson Kasfir analyses in the book as \\u2018late-stage clientelism.\\u2019\\u201d \\n\\nA lost innocence\\u00a0Mr Augustine Ruzindana, who served as the first Inspector General of Government under the NRM government, and later as the Ruhaama MP in the Sixth and Seventh Parliament, says there was modesty exhibited by Speakers such as James Wapakhabulo, Francis Ayume, and Edward Ssekandi. \\n\\nThe trio studied law at the University of Dar es Salaam, which was a bastion of Marxist political thought and anti-colonial revolutionary lore influenced by the works of Guyana scholar Walter Rodney, Jamaica\\u2019s Marcus Garvey, Algerian revolutionary leader Frantz Fanon and the Sudan People\\u2019s Liberation Army leader, John Garang, among others. The trio\\u2019s depiction of statecraft was premised on modesty, argues Ruzindana. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nL-R: Former Foreign Affairs Minister Sam Kutesa, Security Minister Jim Muhwezi, Science and Technology Minister Dr Monica Musenero and State Minister for Luweero Triangle and Rwenzori Region Alice Kaboyo. PHOTOS/ FILE\\n\\n \\n\\nRuzindana says corruption was hardly detected in the Sixth Parliament, which censured two ministers\\u2014Sam Kutesa and Jim Muhwezi\\u2014on allegations of corruption.\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\u201cDuring the Sixth Parliament, there was good faith, you wouldn\\u2019t detect seeking favours. [MPs] were concerned with institutional building. We set up the remuneration structure of Parliament, and there was no sitting allowance for chairing a Committee of Parliament or attending plenary. \\n\\nWe had laid the groundwork that committee and plenary work were substantive duties of MPs,\\u201d the former ombudsman discloses, drawing a parallel with recent times where Committee chairpersons get a monthly stipend believed to be Shs2m. \\n\\nMr Ruzindana says vibrant associations like the Young Parliamentarians Association (YPA), which led the moral crusade against graft, were established through \\u201cour own pockets.\\u201d\\u00a0 \\n\\nHe adds: \\u201cEven being a minister was not lucrative. An amendment was made for a minister to earn a paltry allowance.\\u201d \\n\\nHe says the government negotiated with a vehicle company to purchase vehicles for MPs on a loan scheme whose interest was 12 percent. This was hardly the riches of embarrassment of today where a one-off vehicle allowance of Shs150m keeps a stark and undeniable injustice in the public eye. Per Ruzindana, the point of inflexion came during the Seventh Parliament.\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\u201cThe habit that crept up was the policy paper conference with the relevant committee where MPs were paid allowances. We advised against it, but we failed to halt this practice,\\u201d he recalls. \\n\\nMr Ruzindana says he detected corruption at the Finance ministry as the ombudsman. \\u201cThere was a racket that could send the pension to the wrong place. It would then be resent back through the connivance of government officials and shared.\\u201d \\n\\nIt was during the Seventh Parliament that reports emerged that a trio of lawmakers had attempted to extort funds from a businessman. These allegations were not proven. During the Seventh Parliament, it was also agreed that Committee chairpersons be paid a lump sum allowance of Shs500,000 per month. \\u00a0 \\n\\n\\u201cFor instance, I stood in as the chairperson of the Budget Committee for [Beatrice] Kiraso when she went to study at Harvard University and did not earn any allowance,\\u201d he told Monitor. \\n\\nMr Ruzindana, who served as the deputy Secretary General of FDC, says during the five-year term of the Seventh Parliament, he only travelled twice outside the country to Cuba and Mozambique. He also recalled that the House Parliamentary Commission\\u2019s role was not remunerated.\\u00a0 \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe commissioners accused of sharing Shs1.7b (L-R): Mathias Mpuuga (Nyendo \\u2013 Mukungwe MP), Prossy Mbabazi Akampurira (Rubanda Woman MP), Esther Afoyochan (Zombo Woman MP) and Solomon Silwanyi (Bukooli Central MP). PHOTOS/ FILE/ COURTESY\\u00a0\\n\\n \\n\\nMr Mathias Mpuuga, the immediate past Leader of Opposition in Parliament, has been pilloried for receiving Shs500m as a service award as a commissioner. Fellow commissioners, including Ms Esther Afoyochan, Mr Solomon Silwany, and Ms Prossy Akampurira, also received Shs400m apiece.\\u00a0 \\n\\nWill the penny drop?\\u00a0 \\n\\nSpeaking recently at the Cabinet retreat, President Museveni made a pitch for modesty, noting that \\u201cthe excuse of low pay should be rejected.\\u201d \\n\\nHe added: \\u201cThe corruption we are facing now has got two dimensions. One is the stealing of government money\\u2014taking bribes from the public to provide government services, misusing the procurement procedures to cheat the state, and corruptly handling personnel issues e.g. nepotism and selling government jobs [\\u2026] The other dimension of corruption is employee dishonesty in a private company.\\u201d \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPresident Museveni and Speaker of Parliament Anita Among.\\n\\n \\n\\nThe House Commission is in the spotlight for hiring relatives and cronies of the senior leadership and lawmakers in coveted staff roles at Parliament. \\n\\n\\u201cToday, the job of an MP is an investment, in this type of situation, it becomes difficult to carry out the oversight role,\\u201d Mr Augustine Ruzindana, who served as the first Inspector General of Government under the NRM government, notes. \\n\\nHis comments mirror the decadent grassroots and constituency politics, which has been commoditised where a seat of Parliament is sold to the highest bidder who \\u2018immediately seeks to recoup the investment after his election, through extortion.\\u2019\\u00a0 \\n\\nThe other ugly offshoot of the commercialisation of politics is that lawmakers join Parliament when they are heavily indebted. They are consequently made vulnerable to a cartel of shylocks, who reportedly extend loans to them on generous terms on account that they do the lender\\u2019s bidding. \\n\\nProbably the greatest disappointment is that the proverbial penny is yet to drop. When lawmakers recently returned from recess to address corruption tendencies around the budgeting process, the House Speaker instead prodded them to be one\\u2019s \\u201cbrother\\u2019s keeper\\u201d just as when she made a stopover in Lwengo.\\u00a0 \\n\\nIf it is any consolation, not every lawmaker is living in denial. Speaking on the floor of Parliament during that special sitting, Jonathan Odur (Erute South) offered thus: \\u201cThe strongest justification for not sending this Bill to the Budget Committee is that there is a very serious allegation of grave corruption of the Budget Committee [\\u2026] the wording of the President\\u2019s letter specifically mentions allegations of corruption.\\u201d \\n\\nHe added: \\u201c[The President] isn\\u2019t [raising the red flag] for the first time. When he came to pay tribute to the late Cecilia Ogwal, he accused Parliament of being corrupt. When we went to [the] State of Nation Address, he said that. On Budget Day, he said that. And in the letter, the accusation is on all members of the Budget Committee.\\u201d \\n\\nWhat they say \\n\\nMr Gerald Karuhanga, who served as the Ntungamo Municipality MP in the Ninth and Tenth Parliament:\\u00a0I was in the Public Accounts Committee and saw many ugly cases. Something told me that much of the rot is in the Budget Committee where heavily syndicated cartels I saw with my naked eyes operate.
