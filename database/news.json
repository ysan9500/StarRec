(Courtesy of Lauren Millet-Simpson) Horses have a funny way of keeping us on our toes, don\\u2019t they? Just when you think things are going one way, we constantly have to pivot another way.Our last update saw the big horse Mr Nobility getting ready to display his progress at the LongRun open house. Unfortunately, he had other plans. The day before the open house he had blood and mucus coming out of his nose. The next day, the morning of the open house, more mucus, coughing, and lots of blood pouring out of his nose. The veterinarian came out for an emergency endoscopy to see what was going on, and unfortunately didn\\u2019t really find much other than a very irritated soft palate and a lot of bloody mucus in the throat. Needless to say, we did not ride at the open house.\\t\\tMr Nobility naps in the weirdest places. (Courtesy of Lauren Millet-Simpson)\\tSince we are getting down to the wire as such, we really needed to start going off property and experimenting with different adventures. My coach booked a schooling time at a local show barn for myself and her other student who is going to the Makeover for an off-property ride.The week leading up to going off property was one of the most frustrating weeks for us in a while. Mr Nobility seemed for forget all manners and went back to his super studly behavior that I thought we had worked him out of. I think we maybe had five minutes of actual forward trot the entire week \\u2014 one day he was so completely ridiculous on the lunge I didn\\u2019t even get on him.I decided to throw him on the trailer anyway and that, at the absolute worst, he would walk around on a new farm and watch another horse working in the ring. I set my expectations six-feet underground so there was no way we could possibly fail!Once again, horses surprise us. He surprised everyone that day and was a very good 5-year-old for a lot of firsts.After walking around the arena for a while getting him used to the fact that another horse was working around him, and teaching him it\\u2019s OK to let the other horse canter by and not react whatsoever, Mr Nobility was level-headed enough to hop on. In my mind, this was already a victory as I truly thought I wouldn\\u2019t even get this far. He had never been in a ring with another horse and handled that well, anything else was bonus!He was good enough walking around that we did some trot work. He had issues circling to the right and steering was optional, but I chalked that up to inexperience, lots of distractions, and new things. Overall, he was being pretty good!My coach then set up a little X to jump over. He had never jumped before but she thought he was a horse who would thrive the more we asked of him \\u2026 and boy was she right! Once he fell over the X the first couple times and sent the poles flying, he learned to pick up his feet and ended the day jumping a little vertical with filler. He loved it! He actually paid attention and had better steering while jumping than flatting. Go figure!We have continued jumping in our lessons and he amazes me each time how much he enjoys it and how engaged he becomes. He is almost a completely different horse when a jump is front of him versus attempting to master a 20-meter circle while balanced and supple. We have now put four jumps together and done a flying change in a very short period of time! Not to mention his most balanced canter seems to be the first several strides after landing a jump.We have also discovered that his massive, teenage-boy growing body does require some maintenance as we transition into this new career. He is getting regular chiropractic treatments, which he responds really well to, and occasional osteopathy sessions.\\t\\tMr Nobility does not appreciate fly gear \\u2026 or flies. (Courtesy of Lauren Millet-Simpson)\\tAs with any athlete, it\\u2019s important to listen to the body and react appropriately when something is not 100%. Mr Nobility is a little bit like \\u201cprincess and the pea\\u201d and he makes no qualms about letting me know immediately when he needs a treatment. He is definitely expensive, but at least he is pretty!As we continue to progress toward (hopefully!) going to Kentucky in October, and I discover more and more about this wonderful creature, I am amazed at how much they also teach us about ourselves. After my accident a year and a half ago, when a horse I was riding tripped and fell and my leg got pinned underneath him, my confidence was definitely shaken. Prior to that, I would get on anything and not think twice about it. Now there exists a little voice in the back of my head that just adds a moment of hesitation when a horse is acting frisky or stubborn. But Mr Nobility, in all his 17 hands-plus of pure athlete, is re-teaching me to ride the big trot again and to not be afraid to trust in the foundation of my riding and the skills we have developed together. He is a really nice horse that I\\u2019m very lucky to be riding, and when we have those harmonious moments, it really is the most amazing feeling.I hope to take him to our first show in a few weeks and see what we have to work with. As with everything on this journey, I am expecting anything but smooth sailing, so stay tuned for our next update to find out what crazy things are thrown at us this time!The Jockey Club supports\\u00a0many\\u00a0aftercare initiatives\\u00a0including the Thoroughbred Aftercare Alliance, the only accrediting body in aftercare, and Thoroughbred Incentive Program (T.I.P.), which encourages the retraining of Thoroughbreds into other disciplines upon completion of careers.\\u00a0View all of the initiatives supported by The Jockey Club.Related News\\t\\t\\tmost popular\\t\\t\\tThis WeekThis MonthThis YearNoel\\u2019s Weekend Winners: Picks for United Nations, Haskell StakesShareTuscan Sky Gets Slight Edge Over Dornoch in Haskell StakesShareMaximizing Potential When Betting a Wide-Open Edition of the Woodbine Oaks Share Lady\\u2019s Secret: Horse Racing\\u2019s Iron LadyShareCol.

Overnight, topics relating to race, gender, and the legacies of racism and sexism became fraught within school districts throughout the country. Teachers who covered these grounds in their classrooms questioned if and when they might be called to an administrative office and told their services were no longer needed.The presiding judge, Paul Barbadoro, noted in\\u00a0his decision that the New Hampshire law \\u201cforce[s] teachers to guess as to which diversity efforts can be touted and which must be repudiated, gambling with their careers in the process.\\u201dThis resulted both in self-censorship and the enforcement by school districts of precautionary censorship to avoid legal jeopardy.Books were taken off classroom shelves out of fear of violating the law. The New Hampshire Department of Education created a\\u00a0portal for reporting teachers who dared to speak up for honest, fact-based histories. A bounty was issued with a $500 reward for the first person to report a teacher.Despite the obstacles, many teachers taught the truth and spoke out to news media, in writing, and through informal groups. These teachers did not conform under the immense pressure of the law. Others simply left the profession\\u2014a protest in itself.As similar laws spread across the country, teachers partnered with the ACLU and the Southern Poverty Law Center to challenge the constitutionality of such measures. In Rhode Island, a law was defeated in committee, and in Arizona, it was struck down by the State Supreme Court. In Georgia, on the other hand, a law has been fully enacted, and one educator was fired for reading the children\\u2019s book My Shadow Is Purple to her class.Assessing the varied legal strategies, Professor Derek Black of the University of South Carolina stated in 2023 that he believed the arguments addressing the chilling effect of the laws on teachers\\u2019 free speech presented the strongest cases for combatting \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d laws.Black\\u2019s analysis was prescient in New Hampshire, where Thurgood Marshall\\u2019s dissent in\\u00a0Arnett v. Kennedy held sway. Marshall had written in 1974, \\u201cFor every employee who risks his job by testing the limits of the statute, many more will choose the cautious path and not speak at all.\\u201d In the \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d case, the judge concluded that the vaguely worded statute provided no clear guideline for determining what kind of educational efforts were allowed or prohibited, leaving district administrators to err on the side of an overly broad application of the law, not knowing when an accusation of a violation might surface. All of this adds tremendous strain on our profession and public schools, arguably the central institutions of our communities.The ruling could bode well for Oklahoma, where the primary argument for striking down \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d was based on the vagueness of the law. Yet the positive outcome in New Hampshire comes with a warning: There\\u2019s still a possibility that the legislature could address the issue of vagueness with more direct language aimed at limiting speech on topics related to race and gender.Like other states that have passed corrosive laws targeting public schools, New Hampshire must now decide the kind of civic culture we want to have today and for the next generation.Our small state has long received outsized attention due to hosting the first primary election in the nation. As such, New Hampshire takes its role in the process of picking a President seriously. From the tiny hamlet of Dixville Notch down to Manchester and many small towns in between, there is a sense of civic pride in asking candidates tough questions. There is also a strong sense of pride in each of our local public schools\\u2014a trust in the professionalism and experience of our neighbors who teach.The ban on books and teaching honest history was anathema to the civic culture of New Hampshire. Or at least it put a dent in what many of us saw as our down-to-earth civic sensibility. We understood Florida, Texas, and Oklahoma had similar bills. But could it be that the politically purple Granite State could have such censorship? The answer was clear: It could and did happen here. And it would have continued to happen here had it not been for a federal judge.All of this is noteworthy in determining whether New Hampshire becomes a bellwether in the campaign for reaffirming a national commitment to a democratic, pluralistic civil society. We have seen laws that attempt to limit teaching and learning\\u2014a departure from the principle of the classroom being a \\u201cmarketplace of ideas.\\u201d We have also seen the shortcomings of past curricula that left important stories untold. This brings us to a moment where we all have a collective choice: recommit to the project or backslide on affirming the promise of a more perfect union.The long awaited win in federal court provides hope for educators. That hope is most palpably felt in my home state of New Hampshire, but educators across the United States should take it to heart. It is the hard work of educators who choose to teach the truth and to speak up for what\\u2019s right that creates the foundation of civic life and the potential for civic renewal. But the promise of liberty and justice for all takes all of us working together\\u2014victory over \\u201cDivisive Concepts\\u201d legislation is a chance to improve how we do democracy and support learning for each and every student.

Here's what you should know about Vision Pro before you buy one. \\t\\t\\t By Karen Haslam and Jason Cross  JUL 12, 2024 10:41 am PDT  Image: Apple Apple Vision Pro went on sale in the U.S. on February 2, 2024, and is now available to buy in the U.K., Canada and other parts of the world, with shipping starting on July 12. Vision Pro is a mixed reality headset (Apple calls it a \\u201cSpatial Computer\\u201d) that marries an M2 processor with a lot of custom silicon, sensors, cameras, and more. The starting price of $3,499 means that it\\u2019s a niche product, but it\\u2019s the first in a new category that Apple believes will be critical in the coming years.Update July 12: Vision Pro is now available in the U.K., Canada, Australia France, and Germany.Apple Vision Pro: Worldwide availabilityAfter the U.S. launch in February 2024, Apple had said that the Vision Pro would be shipping to \\u201cmore countries\\u201d later in 2024. At WWDC Apple announced which countries and when: China (mainland): June 28Hong Kong: June 28Japan: June 28Singapore: June 28Australia: July 12Canada: July 12France: July 12Germany: July 12U.K.: July 12Vision Pro is now available to purchase in all of the above countries and the U.S. It\\u2019s unclear when or if Apple plans to launch the new headset in other countries beyond these.Apple Vision Pro: Price and availabilityApple Vision Pro Read our reviewThe headset was first announced at WWDC on June 5, 2023, with pre-orders starting January 19, 2024, and availability in the U.S. only on February 2. The starting price is $3,499 for 256GB of storage, with a 512GB model available for $3,699 and a 1TB model for $3,899. Now that Apple has started to sell the Vision Pro outside the U.S. we have the price for those other territories:China: 29,999 yuanHong Kong: HK$27,999Japan: 599,800 yenSingapore: S$5,299Australia: A$5,999 inc. GSTCanada: $4,999 (CAD)France: \\u20ac3 999 Germany: \\u20ac3.999U.K.: \\u00a33,499You can only buy a Vision Pro online directly from Apple\\u2019s website, by using the Apple Store app on your iPhone, or at an Apple Store. Part of the reason for this is the necessity to get a proper fit and optical insert if needed. Apple takes a scan of your face (you do this yourself with your iPhone if you are buying online) to select a proper face seal size. If you wear prescription eyewear or need readers, you can order special Zeiss inserts for $99/\\u00a399 (readers) or $149/\\u00a3149 (prescription). The headset is not designed to work with your existing eyewear. AppleAppleAppleThere are also other accessories available for purchase, including a travel case ($199/\\u00a3199), battery ($199/\\u00a3199), Belkin Battery Holder ($50/\\u00a349.95), Solo knit Band ($99/\\u00a399), Dual Loop Band ($99/\\u00a399), Light Seal ($199/\\u00a3199), and Light Seal Cushion ($29/\\u00a325). AppleCare+ is also available for $499/\\u00a3499 for two years.Will there be a cheaper Apple Vision Pro? We take the fact that the Vision Pro has the word \\u201cPro\\u201d in its name as a big hint that a more affordable version will be coming down the line. An \\u201cApple Vision Air,\\u201d if you will. Apple is thought to be working on two new Vision products: a refreshed high-end \\u201cPro\\u201d model with enhanced capabilities, and a more affordable model that Apple would aim to sell for a price similar to that of a high-end iPhone.New rumors about the successor to Vision Pro \\u2013 both what it will be and when it will arrive \\u2013 change frequently. They all have one thing in common, though: there isn\\u2019t expected to be any new hardware in 2024. Bloomberg\\u2019s Mark Gurman believes that a cheaper headset will arrive in 2025. He reported in October 2023 that Apple is already working on the sequel to the headset, which will be cheaper than the original model.In June 2024 a report in The Information claimed that Apple had killed the development of the Vision Pro 2 in order to focus on a lower-cost headset for 2025. However, Apple is said to be struggling to bring down manufacturing costs without cutting back on features and performance too much.The Vision Pro is likely to follow the example of the HomePod with the expensive pro model paving the way for a cheaper option down the line. But it could be a while before the economies of scale and advancements in technology make a cheaper Apple Vision product viable.Apple Vision Pro: Compatibility The Vision Pro is its own product with its own software ecosystem. It has its own App Store, and runs software independent from other Apple products (though apps like Messages and Photos can sync via iCloud with your other Apple products).There is support for iPad apps, however. By default, all iPad apps are made available for use on Vision Pro and can be found in the Vision Pro app store, but developers can opt not to allow their apps to be used on the device. White many iPad apps are available, prominent exceptions include YouTube, Spotify, and Netflix.Apple Vision Pro: SpecsThe Vision Pro is powered by an M2 processor with 8 CPU cores and 10 GPU cores\\u2013the same as you would find in a MacBook. It has 16GB of RAM and 256GB, 512GB, or 1TB of flash storage.There are 14 cameras on the inside and outside, a LiDAR scanner, multiple IR illuminators, an accelerometer, gyroscope, and multiple microphones. A custom R1 processor is made to process the vast amount of data from these sensors very quickly, for lightning-fast eye tracking and a delay for the video pass-through of only 12 milliseconds.When wearing the Vision Pro you look through custom catadioptric pancake lenses at a pair of micro-OLED displays, one for each eye. About the size of a postage stamp, each of these displays has a stunning resolution of about 3,386 pixels per inch, more than 4K per eye. Of course, what matters is pixels per degree when looking through the lenses, which on Vision Pro is around 34 pixels per degree (less than you\\u2019d see looking at an iPhone display, but more than most other VR headsets).Apple does not disclose the field of view for the Vision Pro, but it appears to be somewhere around 110\\u00b0 horizontally and 90\\u00b0 vertically.The Vision Pro is actively cooled, with a fan inside, but the fan runs so quietly you can\\u2019t hear it.There are two individually amplified drivers inside each audio pod on the side of the headset near the headband connection. They deliver Personalized Spatial Audio based on the user\\u2019s own head and ear geometry. As a result, the sound feels like it is coming from the space around you. Vision Pro also matches the sound to the room using audio raytracing. The Vision Pro also recognizes the user\\u2019s iris via a new method to unlock the device and authenticate passwords and purchases called Optic ID. Like the iPhone and Mac, all data is stored on a dedicated Secure\\u00a0Enclave processor.  On the outside of the headset is an OLED display with a lenticular lens over it that Apple calls EyeSight. It projects a rendered image of your own eyes with correct perspective, so others can see you looking at them. If you are in a fully immersive environment and can\\u2019t see anyone, the EyeSight display shows a blueish haze.Battery life Apple Vision Pro connects to an external battery via a custom tether, and the battery lasts for around 2 to 2.5 hours. The battery pack has a USB-C port that can only be used to recharge it, though you can use the Vision Pro with the battery plugged in.Weight and dimensionsAccording to Apple Vision Pro tech specs, the headset weighs 21.2 to 22.9 ounces (600 to 650 grams) depending on the Light Seal and headband configuration. That\\u2019s about the weight of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro (24 ounces/682\\u00a0grams). It\\u2019s not necessarily heavier than other VR headsets but quite a bit heavier than the Meta Quest 3, which weighs 18.2 ounces (516 grams).The weight is very front-heavy, mostly in the metal and glass out in the front of the face seal instead of distributed around the sides. The battery pack weighs 12.5 ounces (353 grams). Apple Vision Pro: Hands-on and overall experienceIn our Apple Vision Pro review, we found the technology very impressive, but the comfort and software\\u2014both apps and operating system\\u2014quite limited. There\\u2019s a lot of potential there, but it will take quite a while for the software to mature enough to unlock it, and for most users, the Vision Pro will never be worth the price. With a Vision Pro headset users will be able to watch a movie, listen to music, browse photos, look at 3D objects, and even collaborate on a presentation. Users experience a three-dimensional interface and input system that they control with their eyes, hands, and voice. You select things by looking at them and pinching your fingers together, then dragging objects around or flicking your hand to scroll. A virtual keyboard is used to enter text where appropriate, either by poking at the keys or looking at each key in succession and pinching your fingers together. You can also use voice input to enter text, or a Bluetooth keyboard.Apple has posted a 10-minute guided tour explaining how navigation and gestures work as well as several apps.\\u00a0 AppleAppleAppleWhen you first put on Vision Pro you see your surroundings. You can freely move apps to fill the space around you and they can expand into your space. The digital crown lets you adjust the volume or the degree of immersion in your environment\\u2013from fully immersed in a virtual space to seeing \\u201cpass-through\\u201d video of your own space. Here\\u2019s a primer on what the Vision Pro buttons do.A user can bring a Mac wirelessly into the Apple Vision Pro space just by looking at it and choosing to connect to it if it is logged into the same Apple ID. The Mac display will blank out and be replaced by a big 4K virtual display in your Vision Pro environment; you\\u2019ll continue to use the Mac keyboard and touchpad, however, and audio will still play from the Mac.Apple Vision Pro: Software and appsThe Vision Pro headset runs visionOS, an operating system that Apple has designed from the ground up for visual computing. Apple launched a number of native Vision Pro versions of its apps at launch, such as Safari, Messages, and FaceTime. Apple launched Vision Pro with more than 600 optimized apps. The latest version is visionOS 1.1, which includes support for managed profiles, improved Personas, and lots of bug fixes and minor improvements.In fall 2024, Apple will release visionOS 2, the first major update to the OS. It will bring numerous refinements and upgrades, including the ability to transform regular, 2D photos into spatial photos, and wide and ultra-wide screen views with Mac Virtual Display.Apple Vision Pro: Glossary and terminologyAs with many Apple products, the company has some of its own branding around things that may be better understood by other names. Here are some of the things you may see associated with Vision Pro and what they mean.Spatial Computing: Computing that appears to happen in the environment around you rather than inside a computer (or phone). A sort of umbrella term that encapsulates AR (Augmented Reality), VR (Virtual Reality), and MR (Mixed Reality). It is not inaccurate to call Vision Pro a mixed-reality headset.Spatial apps: Apps designed with the Vision Pro hardware in mind, as opposed to iPad apps running in a window. Some Spatial apps are fully immersive experiences, others are almost indistinguishable from iPad apps.Fully immersive: A \\u201cfully immersive\\u201d experience is one in which your surroundings are not visible: you\\u2019re completely surrounded in a virtual environment. In other words Virtual Reality.Spatial Audio: Audio that seems to come from specific places in your environment. Persona: A 3D digital recreation of you, created by scanning your face using the Vision Pro cameras. It is meant to be used to represent you in video conferencing apps like FaceTime or Zoom since the Vision Pro has no cameras that can actually see your face (just specialized internal cameras for eye tracking).Spatial Video: A new 3D video format that can be captured with either the Vision Pro or an iPhone 15 Pro. Spatial Videos can be viewed using a Vision Pro or even a Quest headset, and look a bit like a 3D diorama of a memory. It\\u2019s an emotionally charged and effective way of capturing the moment.   \\t\\t\\tMacworld is your best source for all things Apple.

The sentencing took place on July 18 with Judge Ha Sang-je of the Suwon District Court's 12th Criminal Division presiding over the case.Mr. A, an expert in the OLED display field, worked at Samsung Display for over a decade before resigning to establish and operate his own display company in Korea. From 2018 to May 2020, Mr. A illegally acquired and used Samsung's trade secrets, including the \\\"OLED Display ELA (Excimer Laser Annealing) Equipment Inversion Optical System\\\" and \\\"OCR Inkjet Equipment\\\" technology, to sell and provide to Chinese companies.The ELA equipment inversion optical system is crucial for maintaining the intensity and stability of lasers used on OLED electronic circuits, while the OCR inkjet equipment is used to bond the OLED panel and the outermost cover glass of the screen. These technologies are valued at more than 340 billion won (around $251 million) and are integral to Samsung's competitive edge in the OLED market.Mr. A's scheme involved his juniors, subordinates, and friends from his time at Samsung, who helped siphon off trade secrets to his domestic company and replicate Samsung Display's technology. In August 2020, five accomplices were indicted. Among them, three former Samsung Display researchers were sentenced to one to two years in prison, while two friends received suspended sentences.In October 2020, Mr. A was indicted and detained on charges of violating the Unfair Competition Prevention Act (leaking trade secrets abroad). His detention period was set to expire in March of this year, and he was released on bail to be tried without detention. However, following the sentencing on July 18, Mr. A was immediately taken into custody.Samsung is a global leader in OLED technology, which is known for its superior image quality, including better contrast, faster response times, and more vibrant colors compared to traditional LCD displays. The company has invested heavily in research and development to maintain its competitive edge in the display market.

The technology giant has smashed the global record for quarterly profits after racking up a surplus of 18 billion US dollars (\\u00a311.9 billion). (PA Archive)Apple has launched its \\u201cmost advanced\\u201d smartphone yet with the iPhone 14, which features battery life and camera upgrades over its predecessor.Its four new models are between 6.1 and 6.7 inches in length, meaning they have larger screens than the iPhone 13, while lasting all day on a single charge.However, one expert noted that Apple had reserved the \\u201cbiggest leaps\\u201d \\u2013 such as a more powerful processor \\u2013 for the Pro, its more expensive handset.The iPhone 14 and 14 Plus feature an upgraded 12MP camera, while the Pro and Pro Max have a 48MP camera.All are equipped with a larger light sensor which can produce low-light photographs twice the previous generation\\u2019s quality.\\u201cLow-light photography has always been a challenge given the sensor size in mobile phones,\\u201d Ru Bhikha, mobiles expert at Uswitch.com, told the PA news agency.\\u201cSo any sort of improvements there, given the amount of pictures we take on a daily basis, will definitely be seen as a worthy upgrade compared to the iPhone 13.\\u201dMeet iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 14, Apple Watch Series 8, Apple Watch Ultra, and AirPods Pro.

Vance of Ohio accepted the Republican nomination for vice president on Wednesday, casting himself as an ideological heir to Donald Trump.Credit...Haiyun Jiang for The New York TimesBy James PoniewozikJuly 18, 2024Speaking Wednesday at the Republican National Convention, Senator J.D. Vance of Ohio became the latest, and potentially most consequential, of Donald J. Trump\\u2019s apprentices to accept the position in prime time.For years as the host of \\u201cThe Apprentice,\\u201d Mr. Trump picked out prot\\u00e9g\\u00e9s from boardrooms full of young supplicants. There was a delicate art to getting the nod. Offend him and you might be dismissed; appear too thirsty and you could get the boot as well. The key was to be yourself but also be him, to be a mirror but a flattering one, to be an echo auto-tuned to please the boss\\u2019s ear.Mr. Vance spent much of his two years in the Senate auditioning for the promotion to vice-presidential nominee, cultivating a relationship, apologizing for his Never-Trumper apostasy and recently blaming Biden campaign rhetoric for leading \\u201cdirectly\\u201d to the assassination attempt against Mr. Trump.Accepting the nomination on Wednesday night, he cast himself as a loyal fighter, an ideological heir and a grateful son of the working class with roots in Appalachia and the Rust Belt.With Merle Haggard\\u2019s \\u201cAmerica First\\u201d as his walk-on music, he began his speech praising Mr. Trump: \\u201cHe didn\\u2019t need politics,\\u201d Mr. Vance said, \\u201cbut the country needed him.\\u201d Mr. Trump looked on smiling in split-screen, as if watching a winner at a season finale.When it came to introducing himself, Mr. Vance had a head start and a challenge. He was telling a story he had already told, in the memoir \\u201cHillbilly Elegy,\\u201d and so had Ron Howard, in the 2020 film adaptation.We are having trouble retrieving the article content.Please enable JavaScript in your browser settings.Thank you for your patience while we verify access.

This article has covered observations made by analysts at IDC and Omdia on the recent developments in the XR industry.Despite a projected stagnation in near-eye display shipments for 2024, the long-term outlook for the market remains positive, Kimi Lin said in a recent Omdia report.\\u201cWith advancements in display, optical, and other component technologies, Omdia is optimistic about the long-term outlook. Near-eye display shipments are projected to grow rapidly from 2027, reaching 92.9 million units by 2030,\\u201d stated Kimi Lin, Senior Research Analyst at Omdia.The global display industry is set to convene at the Omdia Display Conference from September 12-13, 2024, in Shanghai, China. During the event, Kimi Lin and a team of Omdia analysts will present their research on the latest innovations within the display sector.XR marketThe XR market, which includes AR, VR, and MR, is currently facing a downturn, causing significant layoffs at leading companies and prompting several smartphone brands to halt or scale back their XR projects. Despite these setbacks, industry leaders are determined to rejuvenate the market and drive growth in the coming years, Omdia said.For instance, Microsoft announced layoffs primarily targeting its mixed reality (MR unit, responsible for the HoloLens 2 AR headset.Technology major Google is cutting hundreds of jobs in its AR (Augmented Reality) hardware and voice assistant businesses, according to reports.Another tech giant Meta Platforms, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has announced plans to cut 10,000 jobs in 2023.China-based ByteDance-owned virtual reality (VR) headset maker Pico is conducting a new round of\\u00a0job cuts\\u00a0in line with a restructuring.The latest IDC report said global shipments of augmented reality and virtual reality (AR VR) headsets fell 67.4 percent in the first quarter of 2024 as the market is transitioning to include new categories such as Mixed Reality (MR) and Extended Reality (ER).The average selling price (ASP) of AR and VR headsets rose to over $1000 as Apple entered the market and incumbents such as Meta focused on premium headsets such as the Quest 3.Virtual Reality headsets are forecast to reach 24.7 million units by the end of 2028, representing a five-year compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29.2 percent as the consumer base slowly grows beyond core gaming use cases and as businesses adopt more headsets for training, design, and more.Augmented Reality headsets will grow from a smaller base of less than a million units in 2024 to 10.9 million in 2028, representing an 87.1 percent CAGR over the same period, Jitesh Ubrani, research manager,\\u00a0Mobility and Consumer Device Trackers\\u00a0at IDC, said.Growth plansMeta and PICO plan to launch the Quest 3S and PICO 4S in the second half of 2024, both at lower prices than their predecessors to stimulate sales. Meanwhile, Sony\\u2019s PlayStation VR2 (PS VR2) will now support PC VR games, expanding beyond its previous PS5 exclusivity, which is anticipated to boost PS VR2 sales, Omdia said.IDC report on share of AR VR vendors Q1 2024Additionally, Meta Platforms has announced the initial release of its XR operating systems to third-party OEMs, including ASUS, Lenovo, and Microsoft Xbox. Meta will also focus on enhancing the quality and quantity of its platform and application software to improve hardware terminal sales.In 2024, the XR market\\u2019s primary focus will be on the Apple Vision Pro. Its high price is expected to limit its sales, preventing it from significantly boosting overall market growth.Omdia predicts that total XR set shipments in 2024 will remain steady compared to 2023, with near-eye display shipments also flat at 17.2 million units. Nonetheless, the Vision Pro has significantly increased the share of OLED on silicon (OLEDoS) displays.The XR industry is expected to remain stagnant for the next one to two years. While set shipments will experience slight fluctuations, near-eye display shipments are projected to increase more significantly due to the inevitable shift from single to dual displays.Baburajan KizhakedathTweetShareSharePinPrevious articleEricsson posts 7% drop in sales to $5.7 bn in second-quarterNext articleTPG Telecom and Optus network sharing deal faces review in AustraliaLatest Telia revenue grows 2.3% in Q2 as 5G yet to attract customers Netflix grows revenue and subscriptions powered by strong video content Telecom minister releases theme of 2024 India Mobile Congress Airtel secures contract with CBDT for Taxnet-2.0 program Telenor reveals 3% growth in revenue in Q2 after price hikeMore like thisRelated Samsung dropped to third in India smartphone market Telecom Lead -  July 18, 2024 The latest Canalys research report has revealed two interesting...

Not only that, each of the 50 YouTubers received a retro gaming handheld to call their own.The discovery was made on r/SBCGaming, where a screenshot of LilyPichu\\u2019s vlog of her experience being in the MrBeast competition surfaced. Each participant was given a goody bag, which features custom AirPods, and something a little more unusual: An Anbernic RG353V handheld.Article continues after adArticle continues after adThe Anbernic RG353V isn\\u2019t one of the priciest retro handhelds out there. In fact, the device with its 3.4-inch IPS display, and up to 2GB LPDDDR4 of RAM (depending on the version) has an MRSP of $120.99. Even with all 50 YouTubers each receiving their own, that\\u2019s still just over $6000 USD of handhelds alone.While the Anbernic RG353V is not the most expensive, or even the most high-powered retro handheld out there, MrBeast\\u2019s choice to give it away makes sense. The YouTuber has cited his love of the Nintendo Game Boy repeatedly in the past, even going so far as to commission a custom Game Boy from The Retro Future years ago.Related:MrBeast reveals insane ad revenue earned from Twitter/X videoArticle continues after adAlthough the RG353V is not an official Nintendo handheld, it takes after the Game Boy in multiple ways. Its form factor is highly reminiscent of that of the DMG model Game Boy but with some added extras. Article continues after adInstead of just a D-pad and two-button layout, the RG353V features a left stick, a full ABXY button layout, and built-in WiFi. Depending on the version MrBeast gave away, the retro handheld also has a touch-screen to use alongside Android-based games, a microSD card slot, and a 3200mAH rechargeable battery. Maybe some of these creators will fall in love with the emerging retro handheld emulator scene.Article continues after adkeep readingYouTubeMrBeast breaks his own record for day-one viewership with latest videoDaniel ApplefordYouTubeEvery creator in MrBeast\\u2019s $1 million YouTuber challenge & how they got eliminatedCarver FisherYouTubeMrBeast reveals video idea he wasn\\u2019t allowed to makeAlice Sj\\u00f6bergEntertainmentHow to apply for MrBeast\\u2019s $5 million Beast Games competitionMeera JackaYouTubeMrBeast urges billionaires to put their \\u201cunfathomable wealth\\u201d into YouTube contentMichael GwilliamYouTubeMrBeast reveals how much money he\\u2019s made reposting old YouTube videos to XMeera JackaYouTubeMrBeast\\u2019s Beast Games: Prize, where to watch & moreShay RobsonEntertainmentCreators furious as MrBeast nets $250K on Twitter/X for posting old videoVirginia GlazeRelated TopicsHandheldslilypichuMrbeastAbout The AuthorRosalie NewcombeDexerto's Senior Tech Writer.

The Duchess of Sussex accompanied her husband at a ceremony in Los Angeles on Thursday night, where the Duke of Sussex received the Pat Tillman Award for Service, awarded by sports channel ESPN to individuals in the sporting world who have made significant contributions to the lives of others. Harry was awarded the gong for founding the Invictus Games a decade ago to support injured and sick servicemen and women.  Harry opened his acceptance speech by acknowledging the family of Mr Tillman, \\\"especially Mrs Mary Tillman \\u2013 Pat's mother. Her advocacy for Pat's legacy is deeply personal, and one that I respect,\\\" he said. \\\"The bond between a mother and son is eternal and transcends even the greatest losses,\\\" he added.  The couple were in attendance and smiled for the camera (Image:Getty Images for W+P) Meghan Markle and Harry looked smitten at the event (Image:Getty Images for W+P)  Speaking on behalf of Betfair Roulette, body language expert Darren Stanton revealed that the Duke is \\\"in a good place\\\". He said: \\\"Prince Harry \\u2019s body language was very strong when he accepted the award. He displayed a sense of honour and inner pride. When he was speaking about the Invictus Games, it was clear it was very close to his heart.\\\" Mr Stanton added: \\\"When we look at his body language more specifically, both his feet were planted on the floor and barely moved. This is a clear sign of Harry feeling in control without an ounce of nervousness. He\\u2019s in a good place right now. Harry spoke with clarity, confidence, and passion - revealing he felt every word he came out with.\\\" Then, touching on when Harry spoke of the \\\"bond between a mother and son\\\", Mr Stanton noted: \\\"When Harry paid a tribute to his mother, you can tell he was processing his emotions.  \\\"He flashed expressions of sadness, which was understandable as he was thinking about her in that moment throughout his speech. However, he was able to keep calm and level-headed. This shows how comfortable Harry is with speaking publicly.\\\" This comes after Harry and Meghan put on a loved-up display at the awards, with \\\"ownership\\\" hinted from Meghan by an expert. Judi James, a renowned body language expert, told The Mirror yesterday: \\\"Meghan\\u2019s pose on the red carpet with her husband and her friend Serena does make it look as though she\\u2019s either got his back or acting as back-up as he turns his torso partly towards Serena, placing an arm around her waist, while Meghan poses behind him using gestures of ownership and loving support.\\\" Follow Mirror Celebs on    TikTok    ,    Snapchat    ,    Instagram    ,    Twitter    ,    Facebook    ,    YouTube    and    Threads    .

In previous years various amounts up to \\u00a3100,000 were received as a grant. However this year, due to budgetary restrictions, the annual grant has been limited to \\u00a340,000 and sadly costs have not gone down and in fact have increased substantially,\\u201d Mr Higgins said.A Lancaster flying high at the Jersey International Air Display in 2023 Picture: DAVID FERGUSON. (38594549)A crowdfunding page has been launched and Mr Higgins said that if each person who watched the display were to donate \\u00a35, it would not only fund this year\\u2019s display but also put the event on a more sustainable footing for the future.\\u201cThe Jersey International Air Display is part of the DNA of our Island community. Not only is it a significant event in the Island\\u2019s calendar for locals and visitors alike but, with its origins in the previous Battle of Britain Air Display, it also remains a poignant reminder of the reasons behind our Liberation, and our liberty. It also remains a significant day for relevant charities to raise funds to care for our military veterans,\\u201d Mr Higgins said.Watched in person and online by more than 50,000 people \\u2013 the organisers say \\u2013 the display is funded from a combination of private and government sources. Mr Higgins explained that, having had to reduce its scale as a result of restrictions following the Covid pandemic, they now aspired to return the event to its previous stature with enhanced static displays and educational areas.Jersey International Air Display organiser Mike Higgins at the 2023 display Picture: James Jeune (38598762)Aircraft booked for the 2024 display include the \\u00c9quipe de Voltige de l\\u2019Arm\\u00e9e de l\\u2019Air (French Air Force Extra 330), the RAF Falcons parachute display team, the RAF Battle of Britain Memorial Flight Lancaster, the French North American OV-10 Bronco, French Conair Turbo Firecat (ex-S\\u00e9curit\\u00e9 Civile fire fighting aircraft), Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat and the Dutch Fokker D.XXI WW II fighter.Mr Higgins said that, in the event that the 2024 display did not take place, all funds raised would be put towards next year\\u2019s event, or split between Jersey\\u2019s Helping Wings charity and British Military Service charities if the decision were taken not to proceed permanently.Those wishing to support the event can do so using the link: sportsgiving.co.uk/sponsor/activity/appeal-for-12-september-2024/jersey-international-air-display.

File| Photo Credit: PTIAll India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) president Asaduddin Owaisi on Thursday lambasted the Uttar Pradesh (UP) government after a police order reportedly instructed owners of eateries along the Kanwar Yatra to display names of staff. He said this order was akin to reviving untouchability.Speaking to the media at party headquarters in Darussalaam, the Hyderabad parliamentarian said the oral order was in violation of the articles in the Constitution that deal with the right to live, the right to a livelihood and abolishing of untouchability. \\u201cWe have removed untouchability under Article 17, and you are bringing it back. It is a clear-cut discriminatory order. It shows that they want to make Muslims second-class citizens in UP, and in the country,\\u201d he said, adding that since the Uttar Pradesh government gave the order, Muslims working in the dhabas of Muzaffarnagar have been fired.Contesting the Uttar Pradesh government stand, Mr. Owaisi said: \\u201cI challenge you to issue a written order. The Yogi Adityanath government should release a written order and show it to us. There is clear discrimination that is happening against Muslims. The Constitution is being smashed to smithereens.\\u201dThe AIMIM chief said the order gives the impression that Adolf Hitler\\u2019s spirit have entered Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath\\u2019s body. \\u201cThis is like the krystallnacht moment.

A view of the political banner on ECR Road at Lawspet.| Photo Credit: S.S. KUMARResidents have welcomed the district administration\\u2019s decision to launch a dedicated helpline for people to lodge complaints on illegal hoardings, banners and cut-outs in Puducherry.Sub-Divisional Magistrate, North, Arjun Ramakrishnan, had a few days ago, announced the launch of Whatsapp number 9443383418 for people to report on display of illegal publicity materials in public places. Mr. Ramakrishnan, in a release, had requested vigilant citizens to post the photos of illegally displayed publicity structures. The photos should have date, time and location stamp, he said.Welcoming the decision of the district administration to launch a grievance mechanism pertaining to construction of hoardings, President of PeoplesPulse P. Devanathan said it was one of the long pending demands of residents\\u2019 associations and non-governmental groups in dealing with hoardings.\\u201cIn fact, we had written to the administration to introduce a Whatsapp number for residents to complain about banner culture. We hope the move would help residents to immediately bring to the notice of administration the difficulty faced by illegal banners in a particular area,\\u201d he said.Bhoominathan, a resident of Karuvadikuppam, said that though there had been some improvement in the implementation of the ban on putting up hoardings, politicians continue to erect sizeable cut-outs during birthday celebrations and during political meetings.\\u201cWe have seen several proactive steps from the District Administration in removing illegal banners during the last few months but still the rules are violated by a section of politicians. The ECR, near Sivaji Statue was full of banners and hoardings coinciding the birthday of a politician a few days ago. The culture can be defeated only when people completely cooperate with the government,\\u201d Mr. Boominathan said. He added that banners were displayed on Bussy Street to mark the birthday of a prominent actor on Thursday.Hamper vehicle movementOfficials in the Public Works Department said they are facing stiff resistance in removing hoardings and cut-outs from public places. \\u201cTwo weeks ago, our workers were prevented from removing the structures at Thavalakuppam. We faced a similar situation at Murungapakkam a few days ago. People are not understanding that putting up of such display materials hamper vehicle and pedestrian movement. It is also a threat to public life,\\u201d said a PWD official. Mr. Ramakrishnan told The Hindu that the administration would take severe action against those violating the ban order. Around 20 cases were registered under section 6 of the Pondicherry Open Places (Prevention of Disfigurement Act, 2000) for construction of hoardings and cut-outs in public places, he said. \\u201cWe have come across reports of obstruction caused by people to government servants while removing such illegal materials. It is an offence under section 221 of the Bharathiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, punishable with imprisonment or fine or both. We seek cooperation of people to keep Puducherry free from illegal banners and to prevent any threat to the safety and lives of the innocent public from banners and cut-outs,\\u201d he said.Read Comments Copy linkEmailFacebookTwitterTelegramLinkedInWhatsAppRedditREAD LATERRemoveSEE ALLPRINTTop News Today0 / 0Read in AppThe HinduAbout UsCode of Editorial ValuesNews ArchiveSitemapPrint SubscriptionDigital SubscriptionSubscribe to NewslettersRss FeedsReaders Editor-Terms of ReferenceAuthors & ContributorsContact usContact UsSocial MediaAdvertise With UsGroup News SitesBusiness LineBL on CampusSportstarFrontline\\u0b87\\u0ba8\\u0bcd\\u0ba4\\u0bc1 \\u0ba4\\u0bae\\u0bbf\\u0bb4\\u0bcd \\u0ba4\\u0bbf\\u0b9a\\u0bc8The Hindu CentreYoung World ClubThe Hindu ePaperBusiness Line ePaperCrossword + Free GamesOther ProductsRoofandFloorSTEPImagesClassifieds - PrintBookstore & Special PublicationsPopular SectionsElectionsIsraeli\\u2013Palestinian conflict 2023Latest NewsNational NewsInternational NewsVideosLife & StyleFoodPodcastShowcaseOpinionEditorialColumnsCommentCartoonLettersInterviewLeadBusinessAgri-BusinessIndustryEconomyMarketsBudgetSportCricketFootballHockeyTennisAthleticsMotorsportRacesOther SportsSci-TechScienceTechnologyHealthAgricultureEnvironmentGadgetsInternetStatesAndhra PradeshKarnatakaKeralaTamil NaduTelanganaCitiesBengaluruChennaiCoimbatoreDelhiHyderabadKochiKolkataKozhikodeMaduraiMangaluruMumbaiPuducherryThiruvananthapuramTiruchirapalliVijayawadaVisakhapatnamTrending on The HinduNewsIndia NewsLive News from the HinduNEET-UG 2024 hearing LIVEAanvi Kamdar News: Travel influencer dies after falling into gorgeTDS Fraud CaseSC directs NTA to publish results by July 20 noonParody account\\u2019s post lands YouTuber Dhruv Rathee in legal troubleNEET-UG 2024 CounsellingIAS officers reshuffle in TNTrending on Group sitesStock Market Live UpdatesStocks to buy todayLok Sabha Election Results 2024Spain vs England LIVEGold Rate TodaySilver Rate TodayCSK vs SRH LIVEFootball NewsPolitics NewsFrontline Current IssueTerms of UsePrivacy Policy Copyright\\u00a9 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

During a recent Cabinet Introspection Retreat at the National Leadership Institute Kyankwanzi, President Museveni for the umpteenth time publicly castigated the House. It has, he opined, got a bad rap, deservedly so. \\u201cUndoubtedly, the strict measures implemented by the NRA have had unparalleled success in combating corruption in the past, earning the respect and trust of the masses. We, however, have been let down primarily by a few individuals responsible for financial matters, procurement, and the distribution of supplies and equipment,\\u201d Mr Museveni offered, adding, \\u201cThe problem worsened when political leaders, particularly MPs, started paying themselves excessively, which diverted them from their primary responsibility of safeguarding the interests of the people they represent. We are now coming in directly to restore the NRA heritage. The young people, with their passion-driven outlook, and the victims of corruption have a chance to lead this effort.\\u201d President Museveni gestures during the opening ceremony of a\\u00a0cabinet introspection\\u00a0at the National Leadership Institute in Kyankwanzi District on July 8, 2024. PHOTO/HANDOUT/PPU Caught in the shiver of excitement after watching what the youth in Kenya have been able to achieve, it remains to be seen what the yields of the \\u201cpassion-driven outlook\\u201d of Uganda\\u2019s young people will look like. Chatter about a march to Parliament on July 23 in protest against fraudulent conduct by those in power keeps gaining in amplitude.\\u00a0 Empirical evidence shows that, globally, no demographic cohort has seen more wind taken out of its sails by the cost-of-living crisis as the Zoomers or Generation Z. Born anywhere from 1997 to 2012, Zoomers have seen most, if not all, of their dreams and hopes take root in barren soil. Largely written off as passive, a violent inner rage has flared in a great deal of them recently. And not just in Kenya. Zoomers in Uganda demonstrated an underlying outrage on online spaces when Speaker Anita Among claimed that funds pilfered by government bureaucrats eventually trickle down to your average ordinary person.\\u00a0 The Speaker of Parliament made the comments\\u2014a stunning moral recalibration\\u2014at the backend of June during the launch of the Ssentaayi Development Foundation in Lwengo, whose District Woman Representative in Parliament Cissy Namujju, is incarcerated.

Fall from grace\\u00a0Only recently, President Museveni, apoplectic with rage, refused to sign the Appropriations Bill until more than Shs700 billion, which had been reallocated by lawmakers in this year\\u2019s financial budget, was reinstated. Before, the President joined many Ugandans in questioning the wisdom of expending north of Shs1 billion on a so-called service award for four backbench parliamentary commissioners.\\u00a0 \\u201cI could have blocked the moves by the MPs to award themselves high salaries. I opposed [it] but did not block because it is not always correct to block everything you consider a mistake. It is better, sometimes, to oppose but also allow people to learn from their mistakes or for the issue at hand to be clearer,\\u201d Mr Museveni said at the recent Cabinet retreat in Kyankwanzi.\\u00a0 The embarrassment of riches of Ugandan lawmakers continues to be greeted with horror and dismay by not just the impoverished country\\u2019s President but also the citizenry. The laundry list of perks the lawmakers receive includes a one-off vehicle allowance of Shs150m; a net salary of Shs6.1m; a housing allowance of Shs6.5m; a constituency support fee of Shs17.03m; as well as a town running fee of Shs1.945m. They also receive a fuel allowance of anywhere between Shs10.3m and Shs31m, as well as a free iPad and a Shs50,000 allowance for attending committee sessions, among others.

Yet, with barely a year left towards the end of its term, the desecrated Eleventh Parliament is serving as a cautionary tale after its lawmakers became agents of quid-pro-quo deals with senior government officials to feather their nests. Ministers and other government officials attend their retreat at the National Leadership Institute in Kyankwanzi District on July 8, 2024. PHOTO/PPU How did Uganda\\u2019s Parliament, which in the past was a respected citadel against Executive overreach, turn into the poster child of graft? Mr Moses Khisa, an associate professor of Political Science at NC State University, USA, believes the buck stops with President Museveni. \\u201cAs Museveni\\u2019s regime has become rusty, the extent of transactional politics has become brazen. It\\u2019s an accumulation of decay, dysfunction and decline. Parliament is the centre of national politics. It\\u2019s where elite accommodation and compromises take place, it\\u2019s where quid-pro-quo is marshalled, and Museveni has always understood this very well, that\\u2019s why he ensures that the NRM maintains a super-majority,\\u201d he told Monitor. Its genesisThis creeping hand of graft orchestrated by an intricately woven government syndicate began to seep across the hallowed grounds of the Seventh Parliament. The vice has not spared the Opposition, whose lawmakers chair oversight committees, including the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), the Committee on Commissions, Statutory Authorities and State Enterprises (Cosase), and the Local Government Accountability Committee, among others. Many of these accountability committees created the perfect storm for graft as government officials implicated in corruption scandals used part of their stolen loot to bribe lawmakers tasked with an oversight role at the committee level. In turn, the lawmakers, including those in the Opposition used this smokescreen to pander to the gallery. This is because they used their powers to intimidate government officials implicated in graft reports to seek higher thresholds.\\u00a0 How did Parliament, whose lawmakers during the National Resistance Council (NRC), the first Parliament of the National Resistance Movement government, drove Stout pick-up trucks as their official vehicles and only earned allowances\\u2014turn its hallowed grounds into an ostentatious display of nouveau-riche symbols? Mr Gerald Karuhanga, who served as the Ntungamo Municipality MP in the Ninth and Tenth Parliament, said he witnessed the \\u2018ingenuity\\u2019 that sustained corruption at Parliament.\\u00a0 \\u201cI was in the Public Accounts Committee and saw many ugly cases. Something told me that much of the rot is in the Budget Committee where heavily syndicated cartels I saw with my naked eyes operate,\\u201d he disclosed, adding, \\u201cThe Budget Committee cleared the budgets of all the other committees, and it was so powerful that you could read between the lines that almost anything the Budget Committee chairperson pursued, could go through. For instance, a budget for a specific ministry could be passed in totality.\\u201d Former MP Gerald Karuhanga.\\u00a0 Mr Karuhanga said the less-aggressive ministries would receive 70 percent of their budgets and this habit was largely perpetrated by heads of agencies and departments from \\u2018western Uganda.\\u2019 The lawmaker raised this matter on the floor of Parliament and personally pursued public interest litigation against graft. \\u201cThe chairperson of the Budget Committee could pursue this personally with promises after the Permanent Secretary of a ministry conducted a secret meeting with the chairperson. I reported these incidents of collusion, and it is on the record of the Hansard, but no action was taken, that is how some ministries, state agencies and parastatals received 100 percent of their budgets,\\u201d he told Saturday Monitor.\\u00a0 Underhanded practicesMr Karuhanga notes that there were various methods of receiving bribes and some of the cunning MPs physically received cash from those who wanted to conceal their dirty deals. \\u00a0\\u00a0\\u201cIt was never one approach to receiving bribes. There was ingenuity when receiving this money. On one occasion, some unknown men showed up at Parliament in my office over the Lubowa incident and tried to offer me money, which I rejected,\\u201d he reveals, adding, \\u201cThey were emissaries and I threatened them that they could be arrested. They apologised and told me they were shocked that I rejected the bribe money. I did not call the police because I believed that these men accessed Parliament through the connivance of the House security.\\u201d The former Ntungamo Municipality lawmaker said it was usually during report writing when the cunning nature of MPs who had been compromised reared its ugly head.\\u00a0 \\u201cThe report was a stark contrast of what had been unearthed during the probe, and this was so shocking,\\u201d he discloses. READ: How Canadian investors were conned by Ugandans at Parliament Investors bribe State House officials to meet me - Museveni Among, Magogo, Lugoloobi among eight Ugandan officials sanctioned by US Trips outside the country where MPs earn large amounts in allowances, have also been used to reward and punish allies in Parliament. Mr Karuhanga said this practice began during the Ninth Parliament, where the Speaker made the final decision on who could travel. \\u00a0 In April 2020, Karuhanga triumphantly walked out of the Constitutional Court after suing his colleagues for a dubious payment of Shs10 billion, which was slashed from a Shs304 billion supplementary Covid-19 budget to their accounts. Each MP had received Shs20m for sensitisation campaigns in their constituencies. However, in a consent judgment by the Constitutional Court, they were ordered to refund the funds.\\u00a0 \\u201cWhen I tried to raise it on the floor, some MPs threatened to assault me. A few MPs protected me. What encouraged me to challenge it in court was not just that isolated case,\\u201d he said, adding, \\u201cSadly I noted that Parliament had turned into a deals workshop and was so overt in its corrupt practice.\\u201d Mr Karuhanga posits that \\u201cthis consistent pattern has bred a culture of self-aggrandizement.\\u00a0\\u201cFor instance, the Covid-19 budget incident was so shocking when the chairperson, [Amos] Lugoolobi read that there was a gift for MPs when it had not been discussed at the Committee, which I was part of, then all of a sudden, a take-home of Shs20m was introduced,\\u201d he notes. State minister for Planning Amos Lugoloobi (centre) at the Anti-Corruption Court in Kampala on April 17, 2023. PHOTO/ ABUBAKER LUBOWA Mr Lugoolobi was subsequently appointed a junior Finance minister. In August 2023, High Court Judge, Margaret Tibulya, charged Mr Lugoolobi for contravening sections of the Anti-Corruption Act for the offence of diverting iron sheets meant for the vulnerable people of Karamoja Sub-region.\\u00a0 A den of thieves?Mr Karuhanga said he was shocked when these syndicates scaled what he thought was a robust Integrated Financial Management System (IFMS). One of the major graft incidents, he recalls, was captured in the Auditor General\\u2019s report for the FY 2014/2015. The report raised accountability queries in the Local Government ministry. Mr Patrick Mutabwire, the acting Permanent Secretary then, was accused of diverting Shs12 billion meant to procure 111 vehicles for district chairpersons in the country. Only Shs1.5 billion was spent. The rest was diverted to the Local Government ministry\\u2019s recurrent expenditure and doled out as staff field allowance. Mr Karuhanga said the PAC probed this matter and unearthed rot at the heart of the diversion. \\u201cCommercial banks have CCTV that show how these syndicates work. About four staff members were interrogated from 10 am till midnight [by PAC lawmakers] and told us that they would pick up the money almost every week from the bank and hand it over to the accounting officer in tranches of Shs100m. We were surprised that some staff had field allowance days of 1,200 each, others 900 days and 800 days each in one calendar year, which has 365 days,\\u201d he recalled.\\u00a0 Supreme Court Justice Irene Mulyagonja, who was the ombudsman at the time, on October 27, 2015, wrote to the Head of Public Service then, Mr John Mitala, and ordered the interdiction of Mutabwire on corruption allegations. Save for being replaced with John Walala, nothing became of Mr Mutabwire.\\u00a0 Justice Irene Mulyagonja. PHOTO/FILE Mr Karuhanga also recalled questioning a suspected budget allocation of Shs26 billion where Shs16 billion was doled out to the human resource empowerment vote and another Shs10 billion was for capacity building at the Finance ministry. All of this was presented in a 300-voluminous report.\\u00a0 \\u201cIf you were in a rush, you would miss these figures. I asked what is the difference between these two items was and the Finance ministry dropped the Shs16 billion vote. Capacity building and human resource development are quite good votes because the hotels usually get business and quickly provide accountability through invoices,\\u201d Mr Karuhanga reveals. \\u201cCorruption in Uganda is like the bloodline of the ruling party. It has permeated every sector, all the ministries, departments, and agencies and sadly most of the population. When the Speaker changes, the workers at Parliament look at it from an ethnic lens,\\u201d Mr Karuhanga argues, mimicking the words of British author, Michela Wrong, who authored the book titled It is Our Turn to Eat: The Story of a Kenyan Whistle-blower, which is an eye-opening account of tribal rivalries, pervasive graft, and the rising anger of a prospect-less youth in Kenya.\\u00a0 To which Khisa concurs, noting thus: \\u201cOn Parliament and deals, I think the current state speaks perfectly to what Nelson Kasfir analyses in the book as \\u2018late-stage clientelism.\\u2019\\u201d A lost innocence\\u00a0Mr Augustine Ruzindana, who served as the first Inspector General of Government under the NRM government, and later as the Ruhaama MP in the Sixth and Seventh Parliament, says there was modesty exhibited by Speakers such as James Wapakhabulo, Francis Ayume, and Edward Ssekandi. The trio studied law at the University of Dar es Salaam, which was a bastion of Marxist political thought and anti-colonial revolutionary lore influenced by the works of Guyana scholar Walter Rodney, Jamaica\\u2019s Marcus Garvey, Algerian revolutionary leader Frantz Fanon and the Sudan People\\u2019s Liberation Army leader, John Garang, among others. The trio\\u2019s depiction of statecraft was premised on modesty, argues Ruzindana.

PHOTOS/ FILE Ruzindana says corruption was hardly detected in the Sixth Parliament, which censured two ministers\\u2014Sam Kutesa and Jim Muhwezi\\u2014on allegations of corruption.\\u00a0 \\u201cDuring the Sixth Parliament, there was good faith, you wouldn\\u2019t detect seeking favours. [MPs] were concerned with institutional building. We set up the remuneration structure of Parliament, and there was no sitting allowance for chairing a Committee of Parliament or attending plenary. We had laid the groundwork that committee and plenary work were substantive duties of MPs,\\u201d the former ombudsman discloses, drawing a parallel with recent times where Committee chairpersons get a monthly stipend believed to be Shs2m. Mr Ruzindana says vibrant associations like the Young Parliamentarians Association (YPA), which led the moral crusade against graft, were established through \\u201cour own pockets.\\u201d\\u00a0 He adds: \\u201cEven being a minister was not lucrative. An amendment was made for a minister to earn a paltry allowance.\\u201d He says the government negotiated with a vehicle company to purchase vehicles for MPs on a loan scheme whose interest was 12 percent. This was hardly the riches of embarrassment of today where a one-off vehicle allowance of Shs150m keeps a stark and undeniable injustice in the public eye. Per Ruzindana, the point of inflexion came during the Seventh Parliament.\\u00a0 \\u201cThe habit that crept up was the policy paper conference with the relevant committee where MPs were paid allowances. We advised against it, but we failed to halt this practice,\\u201d he recalls. Mr Ruzindana says he detected corruption at the Finance ministry as the ombudsman. \\u201cThere was a racket that could send the pension to the wrong place. It would then be resent back through the connivance of government officials and shared.\\u201d It was during the Seventh Parliament that reports emerged that a trio of lawmakers had attempted to extort funds from a businessman. These allegations were not proven. During the Seventh Parliament, it was also agreed that Committee chairpersons be paid a lump sum allowance of Shs500,000 per month. \\u00a0 \\u201cFor instance, I stood in as the chairperson of the Budget Committee for [Beatrice] Kiraso when she went to study at Harvard University and did not earn any allowance,\\u201d he told Monitor. Mr Ruzindana, who served as the deputy Secretary General of FDC, says during the five-year term of the Seventh Parliament, he only travelled twice outside the country to Cuba and Mozambique. He also recalled that the House Parliamentary Commission\\u2019s role was not remunerated.\\u00a0 The commissioners accused of sharing Shs1.7b (L-R): Mathias Mpuuga (Nyendo \\u2013 Mukungwe MP), Prossy Mbabazi Akampurira (Rubanda Woman MP), Esther Afoyochan (Zombo Woman MP) and Solomon Silwanyi (Bukooli Central MP). PHOTOS/ FILE/ COURTESY\\u00a0 Mr Mathias Mpuuga, the immediate past Leader of Opposition in Parliament, has been pilloried for receiving Shs500m as a service award as a commissioner. Fellow commissioners, including Ms Esther Afoyochan, Mr Solomon Silwany, and Ms Prossy Akampurira, also received Shs400m apiece.\\u00a0 Will the penny drop?\\u00a0 Speaking recently at the Cabinet retreat, President Museveni made a pitch for modesty, noting that \\u201cthe excuse of low pay should be rejected.\\u201d He added: \\u201cThe corruption we are facing now has got two dimensions. One is the stealing of government money\\u2014taking bribes from the public to provide government services, misusing the procurement procedures to cheat the state, and corruptly handling personnel issues e.g. nepotism and selling government jobs [\\u2026] The other dimension of corruption is employee dishonesty in a private company.\\u201d President Museveni and Speaker of Parliament Anita Among. The House Commission is in the spotlight for hiring relatives and cronies of the senior leadership and lawmakers in coveted staff roles at Parliament. \\u201cToday, the job of an MP is an investment, in this type of situation, it becomes difficult to carry out the oversight role,\\u201d Mr Augustine Ruzindana, who served as the first Inspector General of Government under the NRM government, notes. His comments mirror the decadent grassroots and constituency politics, which has been commoditised where a seat of Parliament is sold to the highest bidder who \\u2018immediately seeks to recoup the investment after his election, through extortion.\\u2019\\u00a0 The other ugly offshoot of the commercialisation of politics is that lawmakers join Parliament when they are heavily indebted. They are consequently made vulnerable to a cartel of shylocks, who reportedly extend loans to them on generous terms on account that they do the lender\\u2019s bidding. Probably the greatest disappointment is that the proverbial penny is yet to drop. When lawmakers recently returned from recess to address corruption tendencies around the budgeting process, the House Speaker instead prodded them to be one\\u2019s \\u201cbrother\\u2019s keeper\\u201d just as when she made a stopover in Lwengo.\\u00a0 If it is any consolation, not every lawmaker is living in denial. Speaking on the floor of Parliament during that special sitting, Jonathan Odur (Erute South) offered thus: \\u201cThe strongest justification for not sending this Bill to the Budget Committee is that there is a very serious allegation of grave corruption of the Budget Committee [\\u2026] the wording of the President\\u2019s letter specifically mentions allegations of corruption.\\u201d He added: \\u201c[The President] isn\\u2019t [raising the red flag] for the first time. When he came to pay tribute to the late Cecilia Ogwal, he accused Parliament of being corrupt. When we went to [the] State of Nation Address, he said that. On Budget Day, he said that. And in the letter, the accusation is on all members of the Budget Committee.\\u201d What they say Mr Gerald Karuhanga, who served as the Ntungamo Municipality MP in the Ninth and Tenth Parliament:\\u00a0I was in the Public Accounts Committee and saw many ugly cases. Something told me that much of the rot is in the Budget Committee where heavily syndicated cartels I saw with my naked eyes operate. The Budget Committee cleared the budgets of all the other committees, and it was so powerful that you could read between the lines that almost anything the Budget Committee Chairperson pursued, could go through. For instance, a budget for a specific ministry could be passed in totality.\\u201d Mr Moses Khisa, an Associate Professor of Political Science at NC State University, USA:\\u00a0As Museveni\\u2019s regime has become rusty, the extent of transactional politics has become brazen. It\\u2019s an accumulation of decay, dysfunction and decline. Parliament is the centre of national politics. It\\u2019s where elite accommodation and compromises take place, it\\u2019s where quid-pro-quo is marshalled, and Museveni has always understood this very well, that\\u2019s why he ensures that the NRM maintains a super-majority. Mr Augustine Ruzindana, who served as the first Inspector General of Government under the NRM government: During the Sixth Parliament, there was good faith, you wouldn\\u2019t detect seeking favours. [MPs] were concerned with institutional building. We set up the remuneration structure of Parliament, and there was no sitting allowance for chairing a Committee of Parliament or attending plenary. We had laid the groundwork that committee and plenary work were substantive duties of MPs PRIME Museveni: A thief in my govt?

This 144E is not only a lovely example of classic car with an interesting history but also a great illustration of the quality that has always been associated with Volvo cars.\\\"With a unique provenance this car was originally the property of the late Mr Leslie Charteris who wrote the \\u2018Saint\\u2019 novels.They were successfully turned into the TV series starting Roger Moore and the famous Volvo P1800 \\u2018ST1\\u2019 which helped promote the brand worldwide.Ordered to a high specification this model 144E has some unique features for the period including air conditioning, heated rear window and a twin fog light grille.When he passed away Mr Charteris gifted the 144E to his chauffeur who couldn\\u2019t bear to use it.He put it into long term storage in the early 90\\u2019s after only 33,400 miles of usage.Currently it is the only 144E recorded by the DVLA as being roadworthy.As the only approved retailer and repairer for Volvo on the Isle of Wight, Van Mossel Esplanade would like to invite anyone wishing to see this unique classic car to their premises.The showroom can be found at Airfield Way, Cowes, PO31 8BF and is open Monday to Saturday with plenty of parking.ShareShare on FacebookShare on MessengerShare on MessengerShare on XShare on WhatsappMore from Local Community NewsPolly's Fund Totland Bay Concerts Deliver Unforgettable Evenings Of Music And SunshineLast week, the much-anticipated charity events in aid of Polly\\u2019s Fund delivered two extraordinary evenings of music, fun, and community spirit under the glorious summer sun.Blooming Great Afternoon As Isle Of Wight Garden Heroes RevealedThe results of the annual Wight in Bloom competition, organised by Visit Isle of Wight were revealed yesterday (Thursday) at a ceremony at Albert Cottage in East Cowes.Rescue Of Head Injured YachtsmanA yachtsman who received a head injury aboard a classic yacht became the object of a rescue operation by Cowes RNLI lifeboat yesterday (Thursday).Summer Activities On The Horizon At East Cowes Based Mad-Aid DotThe MAD-Aid DOT in East Cowes is the place to head for some inexpensive summer fun for all the family.Northwood Cemetery Receives Coveted Green Flag AwardThe Friends of Northwood Cemetery are celebrating after being awarded a coveted Green Flag Award.CommentsAdd a commentLog in to the club or enter your details below.Display Name *Location *Email Address *Comment *I have read and agreed to the privacy policy and terms & conditions*Submit CommentLatest NewsShanklin FC And VYCC Recognised Among UK's Best Community Projects With Coveted Green Flag AwardMass IT Outage Hits Companies Around The World With Isle Of Wight Radio Off-AirCowes RNLI Lifeboat Aids Fire-Damaged Motor CruiserOne Card Membership Bounces Back To Exceed Pre-Covid LevelsShanklin FC And VYCC Recognised Among UK's Best Community Projects With Coveted Green Flag AwardMass IT Outage Hits Companies Around The World With Isle Of Wight Radio Off-AirCowes RNLI Lifeboat Aids Fire-Damaged Motor CruiserOne Card Membership Bounces Back To Exceed Pre-Covid LevelsLegendary Isle Of Wight Radio DJ Dave 'Cass' Casson Dies Aged 72 Following Cancer BattleMore NewsRecently PlayedEspressoSabrina CarpenterDownloadMo Money, Mo ProblemsThe Notorious B.i.gDownloadHot In HerreNellyDownloadShanklin FC And VYCC Recognised Among UK's Best Community Projects With Coveted Green Flag AwardIn a record-breaking year Shanklin Football Club and Voluntary Youth & Community Centre is raising its prestigious Green Flag Award.Mass IT Outage Hits Companies Around The World With Isle Of Wight Radio Off-AirIsle of Wight Radio is among a slew of global businesses affected by a global IT outage this morning (Friday).Cowes RNLI Lifeboat Aids Fire-Damaged Motor CruiserA fire aboard a 35 foot motor cruiser with a man and a woman aboard led to a cross Solent dash by Cowes RNLI lifeboat today (Thursday).One Card Membership Bounces Back To Exceed Pre-Covid LevelsMembership numbers across the Isle of Wight Council's leisure centres have bounced back to exceed pre-Covid levels.

Picture: Dan Costello        By              Adam Hamilton        03:44am \\u2022 14 July 2024    Fresh from his greatest win, champion pacer Leap To Fame will delight fans by racing again at Albion Park over the next two Saturday nights. Leap To Fame turned a long-awaited third clash with arch rival and older sibling Swayzee into a display of equine supremacy in last Saturday night's Mr Feelgood Open at Albion Park. In contrast to last year's Blacks A Fake when Leap To Fame found the task of sitting outside Swayzee too much, albeit after copping a flat tyre, he did it with ease this time to take a 2-1 lead. Leap To Fame had Swayzee beaten before the home bend and raced clear to win by 8.5m, seemingly with trainer-driver Grant Dixon just nursing him to the line. \\\"He did it really well. He's as good as we've ever had him,\\\" trainer-driver Grant Dixon said. The five-year-old smashed his own track record with the 1min 51sec flat mile rate taking 0.7sec off his previous mark for 2138m.  He now holds three of the five current track records at Albion Park. Dixon confirmed Leap To Fame would back up in Saturday night's $200,000 Group 1 Sunshine Sprint \\u2013 a race he won last year \\u2013 and the $400,000 Group 1 Blacks A Fake a week later. \\\"He thrives on backing up, He actually loves the racing and the hard runs seem to bring him on rather than take anything out of him,\\\" Dixon said.  LARRY goes BANG! ???? Leap To Fame bolts in the Mr Feelgood Open, making it 2-1 over brother Swayzee in style with another track record \\u23f1\\ufe0f That was absolutely brilliant from Leap To Fame, what a horse!@TheCreekAlbion#QLDisRacingpic.twitter.com/snWSgl1vl6 \\u2014 RaceQ (@RaceQLD) July 13, 2024  The Blacks A Fake has long been billed as the ultimate rematch, but Leap To Fame now dominates pre-post betting at $1.40.  He is also $1.35 to win the Sunshine Sprint. While Leap To Fame beat Swayzee easily last Saturday night, Dixon is expecting a much harder contest in the Blacks A Fake. \\\"Swayzee hasn't had much racing so I'm sure he'll improve on that and be better in two weeks,\\\" he said.  \\\"You've also got to take into account the early work he did, he really had to go hard to hold the lead and that would've taken a bit out of him.\\\" Leap To Fame's latest win was his 15th from his past 16 starts and his 39th from just 50 lifetime starts. The five-year-old is eighth on the all-time Australasian prizemoney list with $2,857,485 and is a realistic chance of taking top spot from fellow Queenslander Blacks A Fake ($4,575,438) over the next 12 months. Beyond the next two weeks, Leap To Fame's major targets for the rest of 2024 include the $300,000 Group 1 Victoria Cup (Melton, October 12), $NZ1m Group 1 NZ Cup (Addington, November 12) and the $500,000 Group 1 Sydney Inter Dominion final (Menangle, December 14). The other highlight on Saturday night will be the second clash of Australia's two top mares, Ladies In Red and Aardies Express, in the $150,000 Group 1 Golden Girl. Aardies Express upstaged Ladies In Red at their only meeting in the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth II Mile at Menangle on May 4. Both mares capped their preparations with wins last Saturday night, Ladies In Red at Melton and Aardies Express at Albion Park. * Adam Hamilton is a paid contributor writing on harness racing for News Corp         Read all news by         Adam Hamilton       View by Tags           Harness                  Racing          Click to Register   Top Bookmakers         Contact FAQ Privacy Terms & Conditions Sitemap News Archive Category Archive             Copyright \\u00a9 Racing Internet Services Pty Ltd. 2024            Sign up for our newsletter     Click To Register    Register for Newsletter                Home       News Form iQ Tips      Results    \",\n      \"type\": \"Document\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"lc\": 1,\n    \"type\": \"constructor\",\n    \"id\": [\n      \"langchain\",\n      \"schema\",\n      \"document\",\n      \"Document\"\n    ],\n    \"kwargs\": {\n      \"page_content\": \"\",\n      \"type\": \"Document\"\n    }\n  },\n  {\n    \"lc\": 1,\n    \"type\": \"constructor\",\n    \"id\": [\n      \"langchain\",\n      \"schema\",\n      \"document\",\n      \"Document\"\n    ],\n    \"kwargs\": {\n      \"page_content\": \"\\r\\tAsian Granito India Ltd opens AGL Universe showroom at Garhwa, Jharkhand\\rAbout UNI\\u00a0|\\u00a0Contact us\\u00a0|\\u00a0JOBS\\u00a0|\\u00a0   Friday, Jul 19 2024 | Time 16:51 Hrs(IST) HomeNewsIndiaWorldSports WorldcupCricketTennis/Badminton/T THockeyFootballTennisEventsAsian GamesOlympic GamesOther Games IPLCommonwealth GamesNational GameSouth Asian GamesBusiness & Economy NewsPRNewsEconomyParliamentEntertainmentStates\\r EastWestNorthSouthAutoworldStartup WorldElectionLandingVideoTokyo OlympicsGraphicsPhotoHindiUrduAbout UNIContact usJOBSCIRP of UNIPRESS RELEASESBusiness Wire IndiaPNNprnewswireIndiaWorldSports WorldcupCricketTennis/Badminton/T THockeyFootballTennisEventsAsian GamesOlympic GamesOther Games IPLCommonwealth GamesNational GameSouth Asian GamesBusiness & Economy NewsPRNewsEntertainment States\\r EastWestNorthSouthParliamentPress Releases \\u00bb PNNPosted at: Jul 17 2024  5:45PM Asian Granito India Ltd opens AGL Universe showroom at Garhwa, JharkhandGarhwa (Jharkhand) [India], July 17: Asian Granito India Limited (AGL), a leading brand in luxury surface products such as Tiles, Marbles, Quartz, and Bathware solutions has inaugurated AGL Universe - a mega size showroom in Garwha, Jharkhand.
